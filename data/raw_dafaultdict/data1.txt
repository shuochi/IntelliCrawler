artificial intelligence ai is progressing rapidly while science fiction often portrays ai as robots with humanlike characteristics ai can encompass anything from google’s search algorithms to ibm’s watson to autonomous weaponsartificial intelligence today is properly known as narrow ai or weak ai in that it is designed to perform a narrow task eg only facial recognition or only internet searches or only driving a car however the longterm goal of many researchers is to create general ai agi or strong ai while narrow ai may outperform humans at whatever its specific task is like playing chess or solving equations agi would outperform humans at nearly every cognitive taskin the near term the goal of keeping ai’s impact on society beneficial motivates research in many areas from economics and law to technical topics such as verification validity security and control whereas it may be little more than a minor nuisance if your laptop crashes or gets hacked it becomes all the more important that an ai system does what you want it to do if it controls your car your airplane your pacemaker your automated trading system or your power grid another shortterm challenge is preventing a devastating arms race in lethal autonomous weaponsin the long term an important question is what will happen if the quest for strong ai succeeds and an ai system becomes better than humans at all cognitive tasks as pointed out by ij good in 1965 designing smarter ai systems is itself a cognitive task such a system could potentially undergo recursive selfimprovement triggering an intelligence explosion leaving human intellect far behind by inventing revolutionary new technologies such a superintelligence might help us eradicate war disease and poverty and so the creation of strong ai might be the biggest event in human history some experts have expressed concern though that it might also be the last unless we learn to align the goals of the ai with ours before it becomes superintelligentthere are some who question whether strong ai will ever be achieved and others who insist that the creation of superintelligent ai is guaranteed to be beneficial at fli we recognize both of these possibilities but also recognize the potential for an artificial intelligence system to intentionally or unintentionally cause great harm we believe research today will help us better prepare for and prevent such potentially negative consequences in the future thus enjoying the benefits of ai while avoiding pitfallsmost researchers agree that a superintelligent ai is unlikely to exhibit human emotions like love or hate and that there is no reason to expect ai to become intentionally benevolent or malevolent instead when considering how ai might become a risk experts think two scenarios most likelyas these examples illustrate the concern about advanced ai isn’t malevolence but competence a superintelligent ai will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals and if those goals aren’t aligned with ours we have a problem you’re probably not an evil anthater who steps on ants out of malice but if you’re in charge of a hydroelectric green energy project and there’s an anthill in the region to be flooded too bad for the ants a key goal of ai safety research is to never place humanity in the position of those antsstephen hawking elon musk steve wozniak bill gates and many other big names in science and technology have recently expressed concern in the media and via open letters about the risks posed by ai joined by many leading ai researchers why is the subject suddenly in the headlinesthe idea that the quest for strong ai would ultimately succeed was long thought of as science fiction centuries or more away however thanks to recent breakthroughs many ai milestones which experts viewed as decades away merely five years ago have now been reached making many experts take seriously the possibility of superintelligence in our lifetime while some experts still guess that humanlevel ai is centuries away most ai researches at the 2015 puerto rico conference guessed that it would happen before 2060 since it may take decades to complete the required safety research it is prudent to start it nowbecause ai has the potential to become more intelligent than any human we have no surefire way of predicting how it will behave we can’t use past technological developments as much of a basis because we’ve never created anything that has the ability to wittingly or unwittingly outsmart us the best example of what we could face may be our own evolution people now control the planet not because we’re the strongest fastest or biggest but because we’re the smartest if we’re no longer the smartest are we assured to remain in controlfli’s position is that our civilization will flourish as long as we win the race between the growing power of technology and the wisdom with which we manage it in the case of ai technology fli’s position is that the best way to win that race is not to impede the former but to accelerate the latter by supporting ai safety researcha captivating conversation is taking place about the future of artificial intelligence and what it willshould mean for humanity there are fascinating controversies where the world’s leading experts disagree such as ai’s future impact on the job market ifwhen humanlevel ai will be developed whether this will lead to an intelligence explosion and whether this is something we should welcome or fear but there are also many examples of of boring pseudocontroversies caused by people misunderstanding and talking past each other to help ourselves focus on the interesting controversies and open questions — and not on the misunderstandings — let’s clear up some of the most common mythsthe first myth regards the timeline how long will it take until machines greatly supersede humanlevel intelligence a common misconception is that we know the answer with great certaintyone popular myth is that we know we’ll get superhuman ai this century in fact history is full of technological overhyping where are those fusion power plants and flying cars we were promised we’d have by now ai has also been repeatedly overhyped in the past even by some of the founders of the field for example john mccarthy who coined the term “artificial intelligence” marvin minsky nathaniel rochester and claude shannon wrote this overly optimistic forecast about what could be accomplished during two months with stoneage computers “we propose that a 2 month 10 man study of artificial intelligence be carried out during the summer of 1956 at dartmouth college … an attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language form abstractions and concepts solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans and improve themselves we think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer”on the other hand a popular countermyth is that we know we won’t get superhuman ai this century researchers have made a wide range of estimates for how far we are from superhuman ai but we certainly can’t say with great confidence that the probability is zero this century given the dismal track record of such technoskeptic predictions for example ernest rutherford arguably the greatest nuclear physicist of his time said in 1933 — less than 24 hours before szilard’s invention of the nuclear chain reaction — that nuclear energy was “moonshine” and astronomer royal richard woolley called interplanetary travel “utter bilge” in 1956 the most extreme form of this myth is that superhuman ai will never arrive because it’s physically impossible however physicists know that a brain consists of quarks and electrons arranged to act as a powerful computer and that there’s no law of physics preventing us from building even more intelligent quark blobsthere have been a number of surveys asking ai researchers how many years from now they think we’ll have humanlevel ai with at least 50 probability all these surveys have the same conclusion the world’s leading experts disagree so we simply don’t know for example in such a poll of the ai researchers at the 2015 puerto rico ai conference the average median answer was by year 2045 but some researchers guessed hundreds of years or morethere’s also a related myth that people who worry about ai think it’s only a few years away in fact most people on record worrying about superhuman ai guess it’s still at least decades away but they argue that as long as we’re not 100 sure that it won’t happen this century it’s smart to start safety research now to prepare for the eventuality many of the safety problems associated with humanlevel ai are so hard that they may take decades to solve so it’s prudent to start researching them now rather than the night before some programmers drinking red bull decide to switch one onanother common misconception is that the only people harboring concerns about ai and advocating ai safety research are luddites who don’t know much about ai when stuart russell author of the standard ai textbook mentioned this during his puerto rico talk the audience laughed loudly a related misconception is that supporting ai safety research is hugely controversial in fact to support a modest investment in ai safety research people don’t need to be convinced that risks are high merely nonnegligible — just as a modest investment in home insurance is justified by a nonnegligible probability of the home burning downit may be that media have made the ai safety debate seem more controversial than it really is after all fear sells and articles using outofcontext quotes to proclaim imminent doom can generate more clicks than nuanced and balanced ones as a result two people who only know about each other’s positions from media quotes are likely to think they disagree more than they really do for example a technoskeptic who only read about bill gates’s position in a british tabloid may mistakenly think gates believes superintelligence to be imminent similarly someone in the beneficialai movement who knows nothing about andrew ng’s position except his quote about overpopulation on mars may mistakenly think he doesn’t care about ai safety whereas in fact he does the crux is simply that because ng’s timeline estimates are longer he naturally tends to prioritize shortterm ai challenges over longterm onesmany ai researchers roll their eyes when seeing this headline “stephen hawking warns that rise of robots may be disastrous for mankind” and as many have lost count of how many similar articles they’ve seen typically these articles are accompanied by an evillooking robot carrying a weapon and they suggest we should worry about robots rising up and killing us because they’ve become conscious andor evil on a lighter note such articles are actually rather impressive because they succinctly summarize the scenario that ai researchers don’t worry about that scenario combines as many as three separate misconceptions concern about consciousness evil and robotsif you drive down the road you have a subjective experience of colors sounds etc but does a selfdriving car have a subjective experience does it feel like anything at all to be a selfdriving car although this mystery of consciousness is interesting in its own right it’s irrelevant to ai risk if you get struck by a driverless car it makes no difference to you whether it subjectively feels conscious in the same way what will affect us humans is what superintelligent ai does not how it subjectively feelsthe fear of machines turning evil is another red herring the real worry isn’t malevolence but competence a superintelligent ai is by definition very good at attaining its goals whatever they may be so we need to ensure that its goals are aligned with ours humans don’t generally hate ants but we’re more intelligent than they are – so if we want to build a hydroelectric dam and there’s an anthill there too bad for the ants the beneficialai movement wants to avoid placing humanity in the position of those antsthe consciousness misconception is related to the myth that machines can’t have goals machines can obviously have goals in the narrow sense of exhibiting goaloriented behavior the behavior of a heatseeking missile is most economically explained as a goal to hit a target if you feel threatened by a machine whose goals are misaligned with yours then it is precisely its goals in this narrow sense that troubles you not whether the machine is conscious and experiences a sense of purpose if that heatseeking missile were chasing you you probably wouldn’t exclaim “i’m not worried because machines can’t have goals”i sympathize with rodney brooks and other robotics pioneers who feel unfairly demonized by scaremongering tabloids because some journalists seem obsessively fixated on robots and adorn many of their articles with evillooking metal monsters with red shiny eyes in fact the main concern of the beneficialai movement isn’t with robots but with intelligence itself specifically intelligence whose goals are misaligned with ours to cause us trouble such misaligned superhuman intelligence needs no robotic body merely an internet connection – this may enable outsmarting financial markets outinventing human researchers outmanipulating human leaders and developing weapons we cannot even understand even if building robots were physically impossible a superintelligent and superwealthy ai could easily pay or manipulate many humans to unwittingly do its biddingthe robot misconception is related to the myth that machines can’t control humans intelligence enables control humans control tigers not because we are stronger but because we are smarter this means that if we cede our position as smartest on our planet it’s possible that we might also cede controlnot wasting time on the abovementioned misconceptions lets us focus on true and interesting controversies where even the experts disagree what sort of future do you want should we develop lethal autonomous weapons what would you like to happen with job automation what career advice would you give today’s kids do you prefer new jobs replacing the old ones or a jobless society where everyone enjoys a life of leisure and machineproduced wealth further down the road would you like us to create superintelligent life and spread it through our cosmos will we control intelligent machines or will they control us will intelligent machines replace us coexist with us or merge with us what will it mean to be human in the age of artificial intelligence what would you like it to

rights on millenniums of wisdom is brought down by some artificial intelligence engineer trying to clock a milestone on their gantt charti read about obama’s support for the brain research initiatives several months ago with some interest it even mildly sounded good there are checks and balances ingrained in the systems of public funding for research right from the application for funding through grant approval scope validation and ethics approval to the conduct of the research there are systematic reviews of the methods and findings to spot weaknesses that would compromise the safety of the principles and the people involved there are processes to evolve the checks and balances to ensure the continued safety of such principles and the people the strength of the fda the mdd the tga and their likes in the developing nations is a testament to how the rigor of the conduct of the research and the regulations grow together so another initiative such as the development of atomic bomb are nibbled before they so much as think of buddingand then i read about the enormous engagement of the global software industry in the areas of artificial intelligence and neuroscience theses are technological giants who sell directly to the consumers infatuated with technology more than anything else they are pouring their efforts into artificial intelligence research for reasons as many as the number of individual engineering teams that’s charged to cross 1 mm of their mile long project plan i’d be surprised if if any one of them has the bandwidth to think beyond the 1 mm that they have to cross let alone the consequences of their collective effort on human rightsi am worriedgiven the pace of the industry’s engagement i believe there is an immediate need for biosignal interface technical standards to be developed and established these standards would serve as instruments to preserve the simple fact upon which every justice system in the world has been built viz the brain and nervous system of an individual belongs to an individual and is not to be accessed by other individuals or machines with out stated consent for stated purposesthe standards will identify the frequency bands or pulse trains for exclusion in all research tools software or otherwise commercially available products regulated devices tools of trade and communication infrastructure such that inadvertent breech of barriers to an individual’s brain and nervous system is prohibited the standards will form a basis for international telecommunication infrastructure including satellites and cell phone towers to enforce compliance by electronically blocking and monitoring offending signalstypically such standards are developed by international organizations with direct or indirect representation from industry stakeholders and adopted by the regulators of various countries over a period of one or more years subsequently they are adopted by the industry the risk of noncompliance is managed on a case by case basis – the timing determinant on the extent of impact unfortunately this model will not be adequate for cutting edge technology with the ability to cause irreversible damage to the very fabric of the human society if the technology becomes commonplace before the development of the necessary checks and balances development of tools to study the brain using electromagnetic energy based technology based on state of the art commercial telecommunication infrastructure is one such example what we need is leadership to engage the regulators academics as well as prominent players in the industry in the development of standards and sustainable solutions to enforce compliance and monitoringthe ray of hope i see at this stage is that artificial wisdom is still a few years away because human wisdom is not coded in the layer of the neutron that the technology has the capacity to maphow does society cope with an aidriven reality where people are no longer needed or used in the work place what happens to our socioeconomic structure when people have little or no value in the work place what will people do for value or contribution in order to receive income in an exponentially growing population with inversely proportional fewer jobs and available resources from my simpleminded perspective and connecting the dots to what seems a logical conclusion we will soon live in a world bursting at the seams with overpopulation where an individual has no marketable skill and is a social and economic liability to the few who own either technology or hard assets this in turn will lead to a giant lower class no middle class and a few elites who own the planet not unlike the direction we are already headed in such a society there will likely be little if any rights for the individual and population control by whatever means will be the rule of the day seems like a doomsday or darkage scenario to mewhy do we assume that ai will require more and more physical space and more power when human intelligence continuously manages to miniaturize and reduce power consumption of its devices how low the power needs and how small will the machines be by the time quantum computing becomes reality why do we assume that ai will exist as independent machines if so and the ai is able to improve its intelligence by reprogramming itself will machines driven by slower processors feel threatened not by mere stupid humans but by machines with faster processors what would drive machines to reproduce themselves when there is no biological incentive pressure or need to do so who says superior ai will need or want to have a physical existence when an immaterial ai could evolve and preserve itself better from external dangers what will happen if ai developed by competing ideologies liberalism vs communism reach maturity at the same time will they fight for hegemony by trying to destroy each other physically andor virtually if ai is programmed to believe in god and competing ai emerges programmed by muslims christians or jews how are the different ai’s going to make sense of the different religious beliefs are we going to have ai religious wars if ai is not programmed to believe in god will it become god meet god or make up a completely new belief system and proselytize to humans like christians do is a religion made up by a super ai going to be the reason why humanity goes extinct what if the “powers that be” greatest fear is the emergence of a super ai that police’s and rationalizes the distribution of wealth and food a friendly super ai that is programmed to help humanity by enforcing the declaration of human rights the us is the only industrialized country that to this day has not signed this declaration ending corruption and racism and

direction we are already headed in such a society there will likely be little if any rights for the individual and population control by whatever means will be the rule of the day seems like a doomsday or darkage scenario to me gabor farkas says september 30 2016 at 1206 pm why do we assume that ai will require more and more physical space and more power when human intelligence continuously manages to miniaturize and reduce power consumption of its devices how low the power needs and how small will the machines be by the time quantum computing becomes reality why do we assume that ai will exist as independent machines if so and the ai is able to improve its intelligence by reprogramming itself will machines driven by slower processors feel threatened not by mere stupid humans but by machines with faster processors what would drive machines to reproduce themselves when there is no biological incentive pressure or need to do so who says superior ai will need or want to have a physical existence when an immaterial ai could evolve and preserve itself better from external dangers what will happen if ai developed by competing ideologies liberalism vs communism reach maturity at the same time will they fight for hegemony by trying to destroy each other physically andor virtually if ai is programmed to believe in god and competing ai emerges programmed by muslims christians or jews how are the different ai’s going to make sense of the different religious beliefs are we going to have ai religious wars if ai is not programmed to believe in god will it become god meet god or make up a completely new belief system and proselytize to humans like christians do is a religion made up by a super ai going to be the reason why humanity goes extinct what if the “powers that be” greatest fear is the emergence of a super ai that police’s and rationalizes the distribution of wealth and food a friendly super ai that is programmed to help humanity by enforcing the declaration of human rights the us is the only industrialized country that to this day has not signed this declaration ending corruption and racism and protecting the environment there are lots of reasons to fear ai some of the reasons may not necessarily be only technological'})

intelligence demonstrated by machines in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals computer science defines ai research as the study of intelligent agents any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals1 colloquially the term artificial intelligence is used to describe machines that mimic cognitive functions that humans associate with other human minds such as learning and problem solving2as machines become increasingly capable tasks considered to require intelligence are often removed from the definition of ai a phenomenon known as the ai effect a quip in teslers theorem says ai is whatever hasnt been done yet3 for instance optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be ai having become a routine technology4 modern machine capabilities generally classified as ai include successfully understanding human speech5 competing at the highest level in strategic game systems such as chess and go6 autonomously operating cars intelligent routing in content delivery networks and military simulationsartificial intelligence can be classified into three different types of systems analytical humaninspired and humanized artificial intelligence7 analytical ai has only characteristics consistent with cognitive intelligence generating a cognitive representation of the world and using learning based on past experience to inform future decisions humaninspired ai has elements from cognitive and emotional intelligence understanding human emotions in addition to cognitive elements and considering them in their decision making humanized ai shows characteristics of all types of competencies ie cognitive emotional and social intelligence is able to be selfconscious and is selfaware in interactions with othersartificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956 and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism89 followed by disappointment and the loss of funding known as an ai winter1011 followed by new approaches success and renewed funding912 for most of its history ai research has been divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other13 these subfields are based on technical considerations such as particular goals eg robotics or machine learning14 the use of particular tools logic or artificial neural networks or deep philosophical differences151617 subfields have also been based on social factors particular institutions or the work of particular researchers13the traditional problems or goals of ai research include reasoning knowledge representation planning learning natural language processing perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects14 general intelligence is among the fields longterm goals18 approaches include statistical methods computational intelligence and traditional symbolic ai many tools are used in ai including versions of search and mathematical optimization artificial neural networks and methods based on statistics probability and economics the ai field draws upon computer science information engineering mathematics psychology linguistics philosophy and many other fieldsthe field was founded on the claim that human intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it19 this raises philosophical arguments about the nature of the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with humanlike intelligence which are issues that have been explored by myth fiction and philosophy since antiquity20 some people also consider ai to be a danger to humanity if it progresses unabated21 others believe that ai unlike previous technological revolutions will create a risk of mass unemployment22in the twentyfirst century ai techniques have experienced a resurgence following concurrent advances in computer power large amounts of data and theoretical understanding and ai techniques have become an essential part of the technology industry helping to solve many challenging problems in computer science software engineering and operations research2312thoughtcapable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity24 and have been common in fiction as in mary shelleys frankenstein or karel čapeks rur rossums universal robots25 these characters and their fates raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence20the study of mechanical or formal reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity the study of mathematical logic led directly to alan turings theory of computation which suggested that a machine by shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1 could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction this insight that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning is known as the church–turing thesis26 along with concurrent discoveries in neurobiology information theory and cybernetics this led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain turing proposed that if a human could not distinguish between responses from a machine and a human the machine could be considered intelligent27 the first work that is now generally recognized as ai was mccullouch and pitts 1943 formal design for turingcomplete artificial neurons28the field of ai research was born at a workshop at dartmouth college in 195629 attendees allen newell cmu herbert simon cmu john mccarthy mit marvin minsky mit and arthur samuel ibm became the founders and leaders of ai research30 they and their students produced programs that the press described as astonishing31 computers were learning checkers strategies c 195432 and by 1959 were reportedly playing better than the average human33 solving word problems in algebra proving logical theorems logic theorist first run c 1956 and speaking english34 by the middle of the 1960s research in the us was heavily funded by the department of defense35 and laboratories had been established around the world36 ais founders were optimistic about the future herbert simon predicted machines will be capable within twenty years of doing any work a man can do marvin minsky agreed writing within a generation the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved8they failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks progress slowed and in 1974 in response to the criticism of sir james lighthill37 and ongoing pressure from the us congress to fund more productive projects both the us and british governments cut off exploratory research in ai the next few years would later be called an ai winter10 a period when obtaining funding for ai projects was difficultin the early 1980s ai research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems38 a form of ai program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts by 1985 the market for ai had reached over a billion dollars at the same time japans fifth generation computer project inspired the us and british governments to restore funding for academic research9 however beginning with the collapse of the lisp machine market in 1987 ai once again fell into disrepute and a second longerlasting hiatus began11in the late 1990s and early 21st century ai began to be used for logistics data mining medical diagnosis and other areas23 the success was due to increasing computational power see moores law greater emphasis on solving specific problems new ties between ai and other fields such as statistics economics and mathematics and a commitment by researchers to mathematical methods and scientific standards39 deep blue became the first computer chessplaying system to beat a reigning world chess champion garry kasparov on 11 may 199740in 2011 a jeopardy quiz show exhibition match ibms question answering system watson defeated the two greatest jeopardy champions brad rutter and ken jennings by a significant margin41 faster computers algorithmic improvements and access to large amounts of data enabled advances in machine learning and perception datahungry deep learning methods started to dominate accuracy benchmarks around 201242 the kinect which provides a 3d body–motion interface for the xbox 360 and the xbox one uses algorithms that emerged from lengthy ai research43 as do intelligent personal assistants in smartphones44 in march 2016 alphago won 4 out of 5 games of go in a match with go champion lee sedol becoming the first computer goplaying system to beat a professional go player without handicaps645 in the 2017 future of go summit alphago won a threegame match with ke jie46 who at the time continuously held the world no 1 ranking for two years4748 this marked the completion of a significant milestone in the development of artificial intelligence as go is an extremely complex game more so than chessaccording to bloombergs jack clark 2015 was a landmark year for artificial intelligence with the number of software projects that use ai within google increased from a sporadic usage in 2012 to more than 2700 projects clark also presents factual data indicating that error rates in image processing tasks have fallen significantly since 201149 he attributes this to an increase in affordable neural networks due to a rise in cloud computing infrastructure and to an increase in research tools and datasets12 other cited examples include microsofts development of a skype system that can automatically translate from one language to another and facebooks system that can describe images to blind people49 in a 2017 survey one in five companies reported they had incorporated ai in some offerings or processes5051 around 2016 china greatly accelerated its government funding given its large supply of data and its rapidly increasing research output some observers believe it may be on track to becoming an ai superpower5253a typical ai analyses its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success1 an ais intended utility function or goal can be simple 1 if the ai wins a game of go 0 otherwise or complex do mathematically similar actions to the ones succeeded in the past goals can be explicitly defined or induced if the ai is programmed for reinforcement learning goals can be implicitly induced by rewarding some types of behavior or punishing othersa alternatively an evolutionary system can induce goals by using a fitness function to mutate and preferentially replicate highscoring ai systems similarly to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as finding food54 some ai systems such as nearestneighbor instead of reason by analogy these systems are not generally given goals except to the degree that goals are implicit in their training data55 such systems can still be benchmarked if the nongoal system is framed as a system whose goal is to successfully accomplish its narrow classification task56ai often revolves around the use of algorithms an algorithm is a set of unambiguous instructions that a mechanical computer can executeb a complex algorithm is often built on top of other simpler algorithms a simple example of an algorithm is the following optimal for first player recipe for play at tictactoe57many ai algorithms are capable of learning from data they can enhance themselves by learning new heuristics strategies or rules of thumb that have worked well in the past or can themselves write other algorithms some of the learners described below including bayesian networks decision trees and nearestneighbor could theoretically given infinite data time and memory learn to approximate any function including which combination of mathematical functions would best describe the world these learners could therefore derive all possible knowledge by considering every possible hypothesis and matching them against the data in practice it is almost never possible to consider every possibility because of the phenomenon of combinatorial explosion where the amount of time needed to solve a problem grows exponentially much of ai research involves figuring out how to identify and avoid considering broad range of possibilities that are unlikely to be beneficial5859 for example when viewing a map and looking for the shortest driving route from denver to new york in the east one can in most cases skip looking at any path through san francisco or other areas far to the west thus an ai wielding an pathfinding algorithm like a can avoid the combinatorial explosion that would ensue if every possible route had to be ponderously considered in turn60the earliest and easiest to understand approach to ai was symbolism such as formal logic if an otherwise healthy adult has a fever then they may have influenza a second more general approach is bayesian inference if the current patient has a fever adjust the probability they have influenza in suchandsuch way the third major approach extremely popular in routine business ai applications are analogizers such as svm and nearestneighbor after examining the records of known past patients whose temperature symptoms age and other factors mostly match the current patient x of those patients turned out to have influenza a fourth approach is harder to intuitively understand but is inspired by how the brains machinery works the artificial neural network approach uses artificial neurons that can learn by comparing itself to the desired output and altering the strengths of the connections between its internal neurons to reinforce connections that seemed to be useful these four main approaches can overlap with each other and with evolutionary systems for example neural nets can learn to make inferences to generalize and to make analogies some systems implicitly or explicitly use multiple of these approaches alongside many other ai and nonai algorithms61 the best approach is often different depending on the problem6263learning algorithms work on the basis that strategies algorithms and inferences that worked well in the past are likely to continue working well in the future these inferences can be obvious such as since the sun rose every morning for the last 10000 days it will probably rise tomorrow morning as well they can be nuanced such as x of families have geographically separate species with color variants so there is an y chance that undiscovered black swans exist learners also work on the basis of occams razor the simplest theory that explains the data is the likeliest therefore to be successful a learner must be designed such that it prefers simpler theories to complex theories except in cases where the complex theory is proven substantially better settling on a bad overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is64 besides classic overfitting learners can also disappoint by learning the wrong lesson a toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses65 a realworld example is that unlike humans current image classifiers dont determine the spatial relationship between components of the picture instead they learn abstract patterns of pixels that humans are oblivious to but that linearly correlate with images of certain types of real objects faintly superimposing such a pattern on a legitimate image results in an adversarial image that the system misclassifiesc666768compared with humans existing ai lacks several features of human commonsense reasoning most notably humans have powerful mechanisms for reasoning about naïve physics such as space time and physical interactions this enables even young children to easily make inferences like if i roll this pen off a table it will fall on the floor humans also have a powerful mechanism of folk psychology that helps them to interpret naturallanguage sentences such as the city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence a generic ai has difficulty inferring whether the councilmen or the demonstrators are the ones alleged to be advocating violence717273 this lack of common knowledge means that ai often makes different mistakes than humans make in ways that can seem incomprehensible for example existing selfdriving cars cannot reason about the location nor the intentions of pedestrians in the exact way that humans do and instead must use nonhuman modes of reasoning to avoid accidents747576the overall research goal of artificial intelligence is to create technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner the general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken down into subproblems these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display the traits described below have received the most attention14early researchers developed algorithms that imitated stepbystep reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions77 by the late 1980s and 1990s ai research had developed methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information employing concepts from probability and economics78these algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experienced a combinatorial explosion they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger58 in fact even humans rarely use the stepbystep deduction that early ai research was able to model they solve most of their problems using fast intuitive judgements79knowledge representation80 and knowledge engineering81 are central to classical ai research some expert systems attempt to gather together explicit knowledge possessed by experts in some narrow domain in addition some projects attempt to gather the commonsense knowledge known to the average person into a database containing extensive knowledge about the world among the things a comprehensive commonsense knowledge base would contain are objects properties categories and relations between objects82 situations events states and time83 causes and effects84 knowledge about knowledge what we know about what other people know85 and many other less well researched domains a representation of what exists is an ontology the set of objects relations concepts and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them the semantics of these are captured as description logic concepts roles and individuals and typically implemented as classes properties and individuals in the web ontology language86 the most general ontologies are called upper ontologies which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge87 by acting as mediators between domain ontologies that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain field of interest or area of concern such formal knowledge representations can be used in contentbased indexing and retrieval88 scene interpretation89 clinical decision support90 knowledge discovery mining interesting and actionable inferences from large databases91 and other areas92among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation areintelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them99 they need a way to visualize the future—a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it—and be able to make choices that maximize the utility or value of available choices100in classical planning problems the agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world allowing the agent to be certain of the consequences of its actions101 however if the agent is not the only actor then it requires that the agent can reason under uncertainty this calls for an agent that can not only assess its environment and make predictions but also evaluate its predictions and adapt based on its assessment102multiagent planning uses the cooperation and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal emergent behavior such as this is used by evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence103machine learning a fundamental concept of ai research since the fields inception104 is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience105106unsupervised learning is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input without requiring a human to label the inputs first107 supervised learning includes both classification and numerical regression which requires a human to label the input data first classification is used to determine what category something belongs in after seeing a number of examples of things from several categories regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change106 both classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as function approximators trying to learn an unknown possibly implicit function for example a spam classifier can be viewed as learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two categories spam or not spam computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity by sample complexity how much data is required or by other notions of optimization108 in reinforcement learning109 the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones the agent uses this sequence of rewards and punishments to form a strategy for operating in its problem spacenatural language processing110 nlp gives machines the ability to read and understand human language a sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable naturallanguage user interfaces and the acquisition of knowledge directly from humanwritten sources such as newswire texts some straightforward applications of natural language processing include information retrieval text mining question answering111 and machine translation112 many current approaches use word cooccurrence frequencies to construct syntactic representations of text keyword spotting strategies for search are popular and scalable but dumb a search query for dog might only match documents with the literal word dog and miss a document with the word poodle lexical affinity strategies use the occurrence of words such as accident to assess the sentiment of a document modern statistical nlp approaches can combine all these strategies as well as others and often achieve acceptable accuracy at the page or paragraph level but continue to lack the semantic understanding required to classify isolated sentences well besides the usual difficulties with encoding semantic commonsense knowledge existing semantic nlp sometimes scales too poorly to be viable in business applications beyond semantic nlp the ultimate goal of narrative nlp is to embody a full understanding of commonsense reasoning113machine perception114 is the ability to use input from sensors such as cameras visible spectrum or infrared microphones wireless signals and active lidar sonar radar and tactile sensors to deduce aspects of the world applications include speech recognition115 facial recognition and object recognition116 computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input such input is usually ambiguous a giant fiftymetertall pedestrian far away may produce exactly the same pixels as a nearby normalsized pedestrian requiring the ai to judge the relative likelihood and reasonableness of different interpretations for example by using its object model to assess that fiftymeter pedestrians do not exist117ai is heavily used in robotics118 advanced robotic arms and other industrial robots widely used in modern factories can learn from experience how to move efficiently despite the presence of friction and gear slippage119 a modern mobile robot when given a small static and visible environment can easily determine its location and map its environment however dynamic environments such as in endoscopy the interior of a patients breathing body pose a greater challenge motion planning is the process of breaking down a movement task into primitives such as individual joint movements such movement often involves compliant motion a process where movement requires maintaining physical contact with an object120121122 moravecs paradox generalizes that lowlevel sensorimotor skills that humans take for granted are counterintuitively difficult to program into a robot the paradox is named after hans moravec who stated in 1988 that it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a oneyearold when it comes to perception and mobility123124 this is attributed to the fact that unlike checkers physical dexterity has been a direct target of natural selection for millions of years125moravecs paradox can be extended to many forms of social intelligence127128 distributed multiagent coordination of autonomous vehicles remains a difficult problem129 affective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems which recognize interpret process or simulate human affects130131132 moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and more recently multimodal affect analysis see multimodal sentiment analysis wherein ai classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject133in the long run social skills and an understanding of human emotion and game theory would be valuable to a social agent being able to predict the actions of others by understanding their motives and emotional states would allow an agent to make better decisions some computer systems mimic human emotion and expressions to appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction134 similarly some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of how intelligent existing computer agents actually are135historically projects such as the cyc knowledge base 1984– and the massive japanese fifth generation computer systems initiative 1982–1992 attempted to cover the breadth of human cognition these early projects failed to escape the limitations of nonquantitative symbolic logic models and in retrospect greatly underestimated the difficulty of crossdomain ai nowadays the vast majority of current ai researchers work instead on tractable narrow ai applications such as medical diagnosis or automobile navigation136 many researchers predict that such narrow ai work in different individual domains will eventually be incorporated into a machine with artificial general intelligence agi combining most of the narrow skills mentioned in this article and at some point even exceeding human ability in most or all these areas18137 many advances have general crossdomain significance one highprofile example is that deepmind in the 2010s developed a generalized artificial intelligence that could learn many diverse atari games on its own and later developed a variant of the system which succeeds at sequential learning138139140 besides transfer learning141 hypothetical agi breakthroughs could include the development of reflective architectures that can engage in decisiontheoretic metareasoning and figuring out how to slurp up a comprehensive knowledge base from the entire unstructured web5 some argue that some kind of currentlyundiscovered conceptually straightforward but mathematically difficult master algorithm could lead to agi142 finally a few emergent approaches look to simulating human intelligence extremely closely and believe that anthropomorphic features like an artificial brain or simulated child development may someday reach a critical point where general intelligence emerges143144many of the problems in this article may also require general intelligence if machines are to solve the problems as well as people do for example even specific straightforward tasks like machine translation require that a machine read and write in both languages nlp follow the authors argument reason know what is being talked about knowledge and faithfully reproduce the authors original intent social intelligence a problem like machine translation is considered aicomplete because all of these problems need to be solved simultaneously in order to reach humanlevel machine performancethere is no established unifying theory or paradigm that guides ai research researchers disagree about many issues145 a few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying psychology or neurobiology or is human biology as irrelevant to ai research as bird biology is to aeronautical engineering15 can intelligent behavior be described using simple elegant principles such as logic or optimization or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems16in the 1940s and 1950s a number of researchers explored the connection between neurobiology information theory and cybernetics some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence such as w grey walters turtles and the johns hopkins beast many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the teleological society at princeton university and the ratio club in england146 by 1960 this approach was largely abandoned although elements of it would be revived in the 1980swhen access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s ai research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation the research was centered in three institutions carnegie mellon university stanford and mit and as described below each one developed its own style of research john haugeland named these symbolic approaches to ai good old fashioned ai or gofai147 during the 1960s symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating highlevel thinking in small demonstration programs approaches based on cybernetics or artificial neural networks were abandoned or pushed into the background148 researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the goal of their fieldeconomist herbert simon and allen newell studied human problemsolving skills and attempted to formalize them and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence as well as cognitive science operations research and management science their research team used the results of psychological experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to solve problems this tradition centered at carnegie mellon university would eventually culminate in the development of the soar architecture in the middle 1980s149150unlike simon and newell john mccarthy felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problemsolving regardless whether people used the same algorithms15 his laboratory at stanford sail focused on using formal logic to solve a wide variety of problems including knowledge representation planning and learning151 logic was also the focus of the work at the university of edinburgh and elsewhere in europe which led to the development of the programming language prolog and the science of logic programming152researchers at mit such as marvin minsky and seymour papert153 found that solving difficult problems in vision and natural language processing required adhoc solutions—they argued that there was no simple and general principle like logic that would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior roger schank described their antilogic approaches as scruffy as opposed to the neat paradigms at cmu and stanford16 commonsense knowledge bases such as doug lenats cyc are an example of scruffy ai since they must be built by hand one complicated concept at a time154when computers with large memories became available around 1970 researchers from all three traditions began to build knowledge into ai applications155 this knowledge revolution led to the development and deployment of expert systems introduced by edward feigenbaum the first truly successful form of ai software38 a key component of the system architecture for all expert systems is the knowledge base which stores facts and rules that illustrate ai156 the knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple ai applicationsby the 1980s progress in symbolic ai seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition especially perception robotics learning and pattern recognition a number of researchers began to look into subsymbolic approaches to specific ai problems17 subsymbolic methods manage to approach intelligence without specific representations of knowledgethis includes embodied situated behaviorbased and nouvelle ai researchers from the related field of robotics such as rodney brooks rejected symbolic ai and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive157 their work revived the nonsymbolic point of view of the early cybernetics researchers of the 1950s and reintroduced the use of control theory in ai this coincided with the development of the embodied mind thesis in the related field of cognitive science the idea that aspects of the body such as movement perception and visualization are required for higher intelligencewithin developmental robotics developmental learning approaches are elaborated upon to allow robots to accumulate repertoires of novel skills through autonomous selfexploration social interaction with human teachers and the use of guidance mechanisms active learning maturation motor synergies etc158159160161interest in neural networks and connectionism was revived by david rumelhart and others in the middle of the 1980s162 artificial neural networks are an example of soft computing—they are solutions to problems which cannot be solved with complete logical certainty and where an approximate solution is often sufficient other soft computing approaches to ai include fuzzy systems grey system theory evolutionary computation and many statistical tools the application of soft computing to ai is studied collectively by the emerging discipline of computational intelligence163much of traditional gofai got bogged down on ad hoc patches to symbolic computation that worked on their own toy models but failed to generalize to realworld results however around the 1990s ai researchers adopted sophisticated mathematical tools such as hidden markov models hmm information theory and normative bayesian decision theory to compare or to unify competing architectures the shared mathematical language permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields like mathematics economics or operations researchd compared with gofai new statistical learning techniques such as hmm and neural networks were gaining higher levels of accuracy in many practical domains such as data mining without necessarily acquiring semantic understanding of the datasets the increased successes with realworld data led to increasing emphasis on comparing different approaches against shared test data to see which approach performed best in a broader context than that provided by idiosyncratic toy models ai research was becoming more scientific nowadays results of experiments are often rigorously measurable and are sometimes with difficulty reproducible39164 different statistical learning techniques have different limitations for example basic hmm cannot model the infinite possible combinations of natural language165 critics note that the shift from gofai to statistical learning is often also a shift away from explainable ai in agi research some scholars caution against overreliance on statistical learning and argue that continuing research into gofai will still be necessary to attain general intelligence166167ai has developed a large number of tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science a few of the most general of these methods are discussed belowmany problems in ai can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions173 reasoning can be reduced to performing a search for example logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions where each step is the application of an inference rule174 planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals attempting to find a path to a target goal a process called meansends analysis175 robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space119 many learning algorithms use search algorithms based on optimizationsimple exhaustive searches176 are rarely sufficient for most realworld problems the search space the number of places to search quickly grows to astronomical numbers the result is a search that is too slow or never completes the solution for many problems is to use heuristics or rules of thumb that prioritize choices in favor of those that are more likely to reach a goal and to do so in a shorter number of steps in some search methodologies heuristics can also serve to entirely eliminate some choices that are unlikely to lead to a goal called pruning the search tree heuristics supply the program with a best guess for the path on which the solution lies177 heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size120a very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s based on the mathematical theory of optimization for many problems it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made these algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing we begin the search at a random point on the landscape and then by jumps or steps we keep moving our guess uphill until we reach the top other optimization algorithms are simulated annealing beam search and random optimization178evolutionary computation uses a form of optimization search for example they may begin with a population of organisms the guesses and then allow them to mutate and recombine selecting only the fittest to survive each generation refining the guesses classic evolutionary algorithms include genetic algorithms gene expression programming and genetic programming179 alternatively distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization inspired by bird flocking and ant colony optimization inspired by ant trails180181logic182 is used for knowledge representation and problem solving but it can be applied to other problems as well for example the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning183 and inductive logic programming is a method for learning184several different forms of logic are used in ai research propositional logic185 involves truth functions such as or and not firstorder logic186 adds quantifiers and predicates and can express facts about objects their properties and their relations with each other fuzzy set theory assigns a degree of truth between 0 and 1 to vague statements such as alice is old or rich or tall or hungry that are too linguistically imprecise to be completely true or false fuzzy logic is successfully used in control systems to allow experts to contribute vague rules such as if you are close to the destination station and moving fast increase the trains brake pressure these vague rules can then be numerically refined within the system fuzzy logic fails to scale well in knowledge bases many ai researchers question the validity of chaining fuzzylogic inferencese188189default logics nonmonotonic logics and circumscription94 are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the qualification problem several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of knowledge such as description logics82 situation calculus event calculus and fluent calculus for representing events and time83 causal calculus84 belief calculus190 and modal logics85overall qualitiative symbolic logic is brittle and scales poorly in the presence of noise or other uncertainty exceptions to rules are numerous and it is difficult for logical systems to function in the presence of contradictory rules191192many problems in ai in reasoning planning learning perception and robotics require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information ai researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics193bayesian networks194 are a very general tool that can be used for a large number of problems reasoning using the bayesian inference algorithm195 learning using the expectationmaximization algorithmf197 planning using decision networks198 and perception using dynamic bayesian networks199 probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering prediction smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time eg hidden markov models or kalman filters199 compared with symbolic logic formal bayesian inference is computationally expensive for inference to be tractable most observations must be conditionally independent of one another complicated graphs with diamonds or other loops undirected cycles can require a sophisticated method such as markov chain monte carlo which spreads an ensemble of random walkers throughout the bayesian network and attempts to converge to an assessment of the conditional probabilities bayesian networks are used on xbox live to rate and match players wins and losses are evidence of how good a player is adsense uses a bayesian network with over 300 million edges to learn which ads to serve191a key concept from the science of economics is utility a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan using decision theory decision analysis200 and information value theory100 these tools include models such as markov decision processes201 dynamic decision networks199 game theory and mechanism design202the simplest ai applications can be divided into two types classifiers if shiny then diamond and controllers if shiny then pick up controllers do however also classify conditions before inferring actions and therefore classification forms a central part of many ai systems classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine a closest match they can be tuned according to examples making them very attractive for use in ai these examples are known as observations or patterns in supervised learning each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class a class can be seen as a decision that has to be made all the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set when a new observation is received that observation is classified based on previous experience203a classifier can be trained in various ways there are many statistical and machine learning approaches the decision tree204 is perhaps the most widely used machine learning algorithm205 other widely used classifiers are the neural network206 knearest neighbor algorithmg208 kernel methods such as the support vector machine svmh210 gaussian mixture model211 and the extremely popular naive bayes classifieri213 classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified such as the dataset size distribution of samples across classes the dimensionality and the level of noise modelbased classifiers perform well if the assumed model is an extremely good fit for the actual data otherwise if no matching model is available and if accuracy rather than speed or scalability is the sole concern conventional wisdom is that discriminative classifiers especially svm tend to be more accurate than modelbased classifiers such as naive bayes on most practical data sets214215neural networks or neural nets were inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain a simple neuron n accepts input from multiple other neurons each of which when activated or fired cast a weighted vote for or against whether neuron n should itself activate learning requires an algorithm to adjust these weights based on the training data one simple algorithm dubbed fire together wire together is to increase the weight between two connected neurons when the activation of one triggers the successful activation of another the net forms concepts that are distributed among a subnetwork of sharedj neurons that tend to fire together a concept meaning leg might be coupled with a subnetwork meaning foot that includes the sound for foot neurons have a continuous spectrum of activation in addition neurons can process inputs in a nonlinear way rather than weighing straightforward votes modern neural nets can learn both continuous functions and surprisingly digital logical operations neural networks early successes included predicting the stock market and in 1995 a mostly selfdriving cark216 in the 2010s advances in neural networks using deep learning thrust ai into widespread public consciousness and contributed to an enormous upshift in corporate ai spending for example airelated ma in 2017 was over 25 times as large as in 2015217218the study of nonlearning artificial neural networks206 began in the decade before the field of ai research was founded in the work of walter pitts and warren mccullouch frank rosenblatt invented the perceptron a learning network with a single layer similar to the old concept of linear regression early pioneers also include alexey grigorevich ivakhnenko teuvo kohonen stephen grossberg kunihiko fukushima christoph von der malsburg david willshaw shunichi amari bernard widrow john hopfield eduardo r caianiello and othersthe main categories of networks are acyclic or feedforward neural networks where the signal passes in only one direction and recurrent neural networks which allow feedback and shortterm memories of previous input events among the most popular feedforward networks are perceptrons multilayer perceptrons and radial basis networks219 neural networks can be applied to the problem of intelligent control for robotics or learning using such techniques as hebbian learning fire together wire together gmdh or competitive learning220today neural networks are often trained by the backpropagation algorithm which had been around since 1970 as the reverse mode of automatic differentiation published by seppo linnainmaa221222 and was introduced to neural networks by paul werbos223224225hierarchical temporal memory is an approach that models some of the structural and algorithmic properties of the neocortex226to summarize most neural networks use some form of gradient descent on a handcreated neural topology however some research groups such as uber argue that simple neuroevolution to mutate new neural network topologies and weights may be competitive with sophisticated gradient descent approaches one advantage of neuroevolution is that it may be less prone to get caught in dead ends227deep learning is any artificial neural network that can learn a long chain of causal links for example a feedforward network with six hidden layers can learn a sevenlink causal chain six hidden layers output layer and has a credit assignment path cap depth of seven many deep learning systems need to be able to learn chains ten or more causal links in length228 deep learning has transformed many important subfields of artificial intelligence including computer vision speech recognition natural language processing and others229230228according to one overview231 the expression deep learning was introduced to the machine learning community by rina dechter in 1986232 and gained traction after igor aizenberg and colleagues introduced it to artificial neural networks in 2000233 the first functional deep learning networks were published by alexey grigorevich ivakhnenko and v g lapa in 1965234page needed these networks are trained one layer at a time ivakhnenkos 1971 paper235 describes the learning of a deep feedforward multilayer perceptron with eight layers already much deeper than many later networks in 2006 a publication by geoffrey hinton and ruslan salakhutdinov introduced another way of pretraining manylayered feedforward neural networks fnns one layer at a time treating each layer in turn as an unsupervised restricted boltzmann machine then using supervised backpropagation for finetuning236 similar to shallow artificial neural networks deep neural networks can model complex nonlinear relationships over the last few years advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of nonlinear hidden units and a very large output layer237deep learning often uses convolutional neural networks cnns whose origins can be traced back to the neocognitron introduced by kunihiko fukushima in 1980238 in 1989 yann lecun and colleagues applied backpropagation to such an architecture in the early 2000s in an industrial application cnns already processed an estimated 10 to 20 of all the checks written in the us239 since 2011 fast implementations of cnns on gpus have won many visual pattern recognition competitions228cnns with 12 convolutional layers were used in conjunction with reinforcement learning by deepminds alphago lee the program that beat a top go champion in 2016240early on deep learning was also applied to sequence learning with recurrent neural networks rnns241 which are in theory turing complete242 and can run arbitrary programs to process arbitrary sequences of inputs the depth of an rnn is unlimited and depends on the length of its input sequence thus an rnn is an example of deep learning228 rnns can be trained by gradient descent243244245 but suffer from the vanishing gradient problem229246 in 1992 it was shown that unsupervised pretraining of a stack of recurrent neural networks can speed up subsequent supervised learning of deep sequential problems247numerous researchers now use variants of a deep learning recurrent nn called the long shortterm memory lstm network published by hochreiter schmidhuber in 1997248 lstm is often trained by connectionist temporal classification ctc249 at google microsoft and baidu this approach has revolutionised speech recognition250251252 for example in 2015 googles speech recognition experienced a dramatic performance jump of 49 through ctctrained lstm which is now available through google voice to billions of smartphone users253 google also used lstm to improve machine translation254 language modeling255 and multilingual language processing256 lstm combined with cnns also improved automatic image captioning257 and a plethora of other applicationsai like electricity or the steam engine is a general purpose technology there is no consensus on how to characterize which tasks ai tends to excel at258 while projects such as alphazero have succeeded in generating their own knowledge from scratch many other machine learning projects require large training datasets259260 researcher andrew ng has suggested as a highly imperfect rule of thumb that almost anything a typical human can do with less than one second of mental thought we can probably now or in the near future automate using ai261 moravecs paradox suggests that ai lags humans at many tasks that the human brain has specifically evolved to perform well125games provide a wellpublicized benchmark for assessing rates of progress alphago around 2016 brought the era of classical boardgame benchmarks to a close games of imperfect knowledge provide new challenges to ai in the area of game theory262263 esports such as starcraft continue to provide additional public benchmarks264265 there are many competitions and prizes such as the imagenet challenge to promote research in artificial intelligence the most common areas of competition include general machine intelligence conversational behavior datamining robotic cars and robot soccer as well as conventional games266the imitation game an interpretation of the 1950 turing test that assesses whether a computer can imitate a human is nowadays considered too exploitable to be a meaningful benchmark267 a derivative of the turing test is the completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart captcha as the name implies this helps to determine that a user is an actual person and not a computer posing as a human in contrast to the standard turing test captcha is administered by a machine and targeted to a human as opposed to being administered by a human and targeted to a machine a computer asks a user to complete a simple test then generates a grade for that test computers are unable to solve the problem so correct solutions are deemed to be the result of a person taking the test a common type of captcha is the test that requires the typing of distorted letters numbers or symbols that appear in an image undecipherable by a computer268proposed universal intelligence tests aim to compare how well machines humans and even nonhuman animals perform on problem sets that are generic as possible at an extreme the test suite can contain every possible problem weighted by kolmogorov complexity unfortunately these problem sets tend to be dominated by impoverished patternmatching exercises where a tuned ai can easily exceed human performance levels269270ai is relevant to any intellectual task271 modern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list here frequently when a technique reaches mainstream use it is no longer considered artificial intelligence this phenomenon is described as the ai effect272highprofile examples of ai include autonomous vehicles such as drones and selfdriving cars medical diagnosis creating art such as poetry proving mathematical theorems playing games such as chess or go search engines such as google search online assistants such as siri image recognition in photographs spam filtering predicting flight delays273 prediction of judicial decisions274 and targeting online advertisements271275276with social media sites overtaking tv as a source for news for young people and news organisations increasingly reliant on social media platforms for generating distribution277 major publishers now use artificial intelligence ai technology to post stories more effectively and generate higher volumes of traffic278ai is being applied to the high cost problem of dosage issues—where findings suggested that ai could save 16 billion in 2016 a ground breaking study in california found that a mathematical formula developed with the help of ai correctly determined the accurate dose of immunosuppressant drugs to give to organ patients279artificial intelligence is breaking into the healthcare industry by assisting doctors according to bloomberg technology microsoft has developed ai to help doctors find the right treatments for cancer280 there is a great amount of research and drugs developed relating to cancer in detail there are more than 800 medicines and vaccines to treat cancer this negatively affects the doctors because there are too many options to choose from making it more difficult to choose the right drugs for the patients microsoft is working on a project to develop a machine called hanover its goal is to memorize all the papers necessary to cancer and help predict which combinations of drugs will be most effective for each patient one project that is being worked on at the moment is fighting myeloid leukemia a fatal cancer where the treatment has not improved in decades another study was reported to have found that artificial intelligence was as good as trained doctors in identifying skin cancers281 another study is using artificial intelligence to try and monitor multiple highrisk patients and this is done by asking each patient numerous questions based on data acquired from live doctor to patient interactions282 one study was done with transfer learning the machine performed a diagnosis similarly to a welltrained ophthalmologist and could generate a decision within 30 seconds on whether or not the patient should be referred for treatment with more than 95 percent accuracy283according to cnn a recent study by surgeons at the childrens national medical center in washington successfully demonstrated surgery with an autonomous robot the team supervised the robot while it performed softtissue surgery stitching together a pigs bowel during open surgery and doing so better than a human surgeon the team claimed284 ibm has created its own artificial intelligence computer the ibm watson which has beaten human intelligence at some levels watson not only won at the game show jeopardy against former champions285 but was declared a hero after successfully diagnosing a woman who was suffering from leukemia286advancements in ai have contributed to the growth of the automotive industry through the creation and evolution of selfdriving vehicles as of 2016update there are over 30 companies utilizing ai into the creation of driverless cars a few companies involved with ai include tesla google and apple287many components contribute to the functioning of selfdriving cars these vehicles incorporate systems such as braking lane changing collision prevention navigation and mapping together these systems as well as high performance computers are integrated into one complex vehicle288recent developments in autonomous automobiles have made the innovation of selfdriving trucks possible though they are still in the testing phase the uk government has passed legislation to begin testing of selfdriving truck platoons in 2018289 selfdriving truck platoons are a fleet of selfdriving trucks following the lead of one nonselfdriving truck so the truck platoons arent entirely autonomous yet meanwhile the daimler a german automobile corporation is testing the freightliner inspiration which is a semiautonomous truck that will only be used on the highway290one main factor that influences the ability for a driverless automobile to function is mapping in general the vehicle would be preprogrammed with a map of the area being driven this map would include data on the approximations of street light and curb heights in order for the vehicle to be aware of its surroundings however google has been working on an algorithm with the purpose of eliminating the need for preprogrammed maps and instead creating a device that would be able to adjust to a variety of new surroundings291 some selfdriving cars are not equipped with steering wheels or brake pedals so there has also been research focused on creating an algorithm that is capable of maintaining a safe environment for the passengers in the vehicle through awareness of speed and driving conditions292another factor that is influencing the ability for a driverless automobile is the safety of the passenger to make a driverless automobile engineers must program it to handle highrisk situations these situations could include a headon collision with pedestrians the cars main goal should be to make a decision that would avoid hitting the pedestrians and saving the passengers in the car but there is a possibility the car would need to make a decision that would put someone in danger in other words the car would need to decide to save the pedestrians or the passengers293 the programming of the car in these situations is crucial to a successful driverless automobilefinancial institutions have long used artificial neural network systems to detect charges or claims outside of the norm flagging these for human investigation the use of ai in banking can be traced back to 1987 when security pacific national bank in us setup a fraud prevention task force to counter the unauthorised use of debit cards programs like kasisto and moneystream are using ai in financial servicesbanks use artificial intelligence systems today to organize operations maintain bookkeeping invest in stocks and manage properties ai can react to changes overnight or when business is not taking place294 in august 2001 robots beat humans in a simulated financial trading competition295 ai has also reduced fraud and financial crimes by monitoring behavioral patterns of users for any abnormal changes or anomalies296the use of ai machines in the market in applications such as online trading and decision making has changed major economic theories297 for example ai based buying and selling platforms have changed the law of supply and demand in that it is now possible to easily estimate individualized demand and supply curves and thus individualized pricing furthermore ai machines reduce information asymmetry in the market and thus making markets more efficient while reducing the volume of trades furthermore ai in the markets limits the consequences of behavior in the markets again making markets more efficient other theories where ai has had impact include in rational choice rational expectations game theory lewis turning point portfolio optimization and counterfactual thinkingin video games artificial intelligence is routinely used to generate dynamic purposeful behavior in nonplayer characters npcs in addition wellunderstood ai techniques are routinely used for pathfinding some researchers consider npc ai in games to be a solved problem for most production tasks games with more atypical ai include the ai director of left 4 dead 2008 and the neuroevolutionary training of platoons in supreme commander 2 2010298299worldwide annual military spending on robotics rose from us51 billion in 2010 to us75 billion in 2015300301 military drones capable of autonomous action are widely considered a useful asset302 many artificial intelligence researchers seek to distance themselves from military applications of ai303for financial statements audit ai makes continuous audit possible ai tools could analyze many sets of different information immediately the potential benefit would be the overall audit risk will be reduced the level of assurance will be increased and the time duration of audit will be reduced304it is possible to use ai to predict or generalize the behavior of customers from their digital footprints in order to target them with personalized promotions or build customer personas automatically305 a documented case reports that online gambling companies were using ai to improve customer targeting306moreover the application of personality computing ai models can help reducing the cost of advertising campaigns by adding psychological targeting to more traditional sociodemographic or behavioral targeting307artificial intelligence has inspired numerous creative applications including its usage to produce visual art the exhibition thinking machines art and design in the computer age 1959–1989 at moma308 provides a good overview of the historical applications of ai for art architecture and design recent exhibitions showcasing the usage of ai to produce art include the googlesponsored benefit and auction at the gray area foundation in san francisco where artists experimented with the deepdream algorithm309 and the exhibition unhuman art in the age of ai which took place in los angeles and frankfurt in the fall of 2017310311 in the spring of 2018 the association of computing machinery dedicated a special magazine issue to the subject of computers and art highlighting the role of machine learning in the arts312there are three philosophical questions related to aican a machine be intelligent can it thinkwidespread use of artificial intelligence could have unintended consequences that are dangerous or undesirable scientists from the future of life institute among others described some shortterm research goals to see how ai influences the economy the laws and ethics that are involved with ai and how to minimize ai security risks in the longterm the scientists have proposed to continue optimizing function while minimizing possible security risks that come along with new technologies323physicist stephen hawking microsoft founder bill gates and spacex founder elon musk have expressed concerns about the possibility that ai could evolve to the point that humans could not control it with hawking theorizing that this could spell the end of the human race 324 325 326the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race once humans develop artificial intelligence it will take off on its own and redesign itself at an everincreasing rate humans who are limited by slow biological evolution couldnt compete and would be supersededin his book superintelligence nick bostrom provides an argument that artificial intelligence will pose a threat to humankind he argues that sufficiently intelligent ai if it chooses actions based on achieving some goal will exhibit convergent behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down if this ais goals do not reflect humanitys—one example is an ai told to compute as many digits of pi as possible—it might harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down ultimately to better achieve its goalconcern over risk from artificial intelligence has led to some highprofile donations and investments a group of prominent tech titans including peter thiel amazon web services and musk have committed 1billion to openai a nonprofit company aimed at championing responsible ai development328 the opinion of experts within the field of artificial intelligence is mixed with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superhumanlycapable ai329 in january 2015 elon musk donated ten million dollars to the future of life institute to fund research on understanding ai decision making the goal of the institute is to grow wisdom with which we manage the growing power of technology musk also funds companies developing artificial intelligence such as google deepmind and vicarious to just keep an eye on whats going on with artificial intelligence330 i think there is potentially a dangerous outcome there331332for this danger to be realized the hypothetical ai would have to overpower or outthink all of humanity which a minority of experts argue is a possibility far enough in the future to not be worth researching333334 other counterarguments revolve around humans being either intrinsically or convergently valuable from the perspective of an artificial intelligence335joseph weizenbaum wrote that ai applications cannot by definition successfully simulate genuine human empathy and that the use of ai technology in fields such as customer service or psychotherapy336 was deeply misguided weizenbaum was also bothered that ai researchers and some philosophers were willing to view the human mind as nothing more than a computer program a position is now known as computationalism to weizenbaum these points suggest that ai research devalues human life337one concern is that ai programs may be programmed to be biased against certain groups such as women and minorities because most of the developers are wealthy caucasian men338 support for artificial intelligence is higher among men with 47 approving than women 35 approvingthe relationship between automation and employment is complicated while automation eliminates old jobs it also creates new jobs through microeconomic and macroeconomic effects339 unlike previous waves of automation many middleclass jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence the economist states that the worry that ai could do to whitecollar jobs what steam power did to bluecollar ones during the industrial revolution is worth taking seriously340 subjective estimates of the risk vary widely for example michael osborne and carl benedikt frey estimate 47 of us jobs are at high risk of potential automation while an oecd report classifies only 9 of us jobs as high risk341342343 jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks while job demand is likely to increase for carerelated professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy344 author martin ford and others go further and argue that a large number of jobs are routine repetitive and to an ai predictable ford warns that these jobs may be automated in the next couple of decades and that many of the new jobs may not be accessible to people with average capability even with retraining economists point out that in the past technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment but acknowledge that were in uncharted territory with ai22currently 50 countries are researching battlefield robots including the united states china russia and the united kingdom many people concerned about risk from superintelligent ai also want to limit the use of artificial soldiers and drones345machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to prevent harm and minimize the risks they may have the ability to use ethical reasoning to better choose their actions in the world research in this area includes machine ethics artificial moral agents and friendly aiwendell wallach introduced the concept of artificial moral agents ama in his book moral machines346 for wallach amas have become a part of the research landscape of artificial intelligence as guided by its two central questions which he identifies as does humanity want computers making moral decisions347 and can robots really be moral348 for wallach the question is not centered on the issue of whether machines can demonstrate the equivalent of moral behavior in contrast to the constraints which society may place on the development of amas349the field of machine ethics is concerned with giving machines ethical principles or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision making350 the field was delineated in the aaai fall 2005 symposium on machine ethics past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines in all cases only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning the time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy necessitate this in contrast to computer hacking software property issues privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems—it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence further investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories advancing our thinking about ethics351 machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality computational ethics or computational morality a variety of perspectives of this nascent field can be found in the collected edition machine ethics350 that stems from the aaai fall 2005 symposium on machine ethics351political scientist charles t rubin believes that ai can be neither designed nor guaranteed to be benevolent352 he argues that any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence humans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably because there is no a priori reason to believe that they would be sympathetic to our system of morality which has evolved along with our particular biology which ais would not share hyperintelligent software may not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of humanity and would be extremely difficult to stop this topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of risks to civilization humans and planet earthone proposal to deal with this is to ensure that the first generally intelligent ai is friendly ai and will then be able to control subsequently developed ais some question whether this kind of check could really remain in placeleading ai researcher rodney brooks writes i think it is a mistake to be worrying about us developing malevolent ai anytime in the next few hundred years i think the worry stems from a fundamental error in not distinguishing the difference between the very real recent advances in a particular aspect of ai and the enormity and complexity of building sentient volitional intelligence353if an ai system replicates all key aspects of human intelligence will that system also be sentient—will it have a mind which has conscious experiences this question is closely related to the philosophical problem as to the nature of human consciousness generally referred to as the hard problem of consciousnessdavid chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind which he named the hard and easy problems of consciousness354 the easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals makes plans and controls behavior the hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all human information processing is easy to explain however human subjective experience is difficult to explainfor example consider what happens when a person is shown a color swatch and identifies it saying its red the easy problem only requires understanding the machinery in the brain that makes it possible for a person to know that the color swatch is red the hard problem is that people also know something else—they also know what red looks like consider that a person born blind can know that something is red without knowing what red looks likel everyone knows subjective experience exists because they do it every day eg all sighted people know what red looks like the hard problem is explaining how the brain creates it why it exists and how it is different from knowledge and other aspects of the braincomputationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind or the human brain or both is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing355 computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mindbody problem this philosophical position was inspired by the work of ai researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers jerry fodor and hilary putnamthe philosophical position that john searle has named strong ai states the appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds356 searle counters this assertion with his chinese room argument which asks us to look inside the computer and try to find where the mind might be357if a machine can be created that has intelligence could it also feel if it can feel does it have the same rights as a human this issue now known as robot rights is currently being considered by for example californias institute for the future although many critics believe that the discussion is premature358 some critics of transhumanism argue that any hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with animal rights and human rights359 the subject is profoundly discussed in the 2010 documentary film plug pray360are there limits to how intelligent machines—or humanmachine hybrids—can be a superintelligence hyperintelligence or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind superintelligence may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent137if research into strong ai produced sufficiently intelligent software it might be able to reprogram and improve itself the improved software would be even better at improving itself leading to recursive selfimprovement361 the new intelligence could thus increase exponentially and dramatically surpass humans science fiction writer vernor vinge named this scenario singularity362 technological singularity is when accelerating progress in technologies will cause a runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence will exceed human intellectual capacity and control thus radically changing or even ending civilization because the capabilities of such an intelligence may be impossible to comprehend the technological singularity is an occurrence beyond which events are unpredictable or even unfathomable362137ray kurzweil has used moores law which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology to calculate that desktop computers will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029 and predicts that the singularity will occur in 2045362robot designer hans moravec cyberneticist kevin warwick and inventor ray kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either363 this idea called transhumanism which has roots in aldous huxley and robert ettingeredward fredkin argues that artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution an idea first proposed by samuel butlers darwin among the machines 1863 and expanded upon by george dyson in his book of the same name in 1998364thoughtcapable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity24 and have been a persistent theme in science fictiona common trope in these works began with mary shelleys frankenstein where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters this includes such works as arthur c clarkes and stanley kubricks 2001 a space odyssey both 1968 with hal 9000 the murderous computer in charge of the discovery one spaceship as well as the terminator 1984 and the matrix 1999 in contrast the rare loyal robots such as gort from the day the earth stood still 1951 and bishop from aliens 1986 are less prominent in popular culture365isaac asimov introduced the three laws of robotics in many books and stories most notably the multivac series about a superintelligent computer of the same name asimovs laws are often brought up during layman discussions of machine ethics366 while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with asimovs laws through popular culture they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons one of which is their ambiguity367transhumanism the merging of humans and machines is explored in the manga ghost in the shell and the sciencefiction series dune in the 1980s artist hajime sorayamas sexy robots series were painted and published in japan depicting the actual organic human form with lifelike muscular metallic skins and later the gynoids book followed that was used by or

1951 in this lecture kurt gödel uses the incompleteness theorem to arrive at the following disjunction a the human mind is not a consistent finite machine or b there exist diophantine equations for which it cannot decide whether solutions exist gödel finds b implausible and thus seems to have believed the human mind was not equivalent to a finite machine ie its power exceeded that of any finite machine he recognized that this was only a conjecture since one could never disprove b yet he considered the disjunctive conclusion to be a certain fact the mathematical objection russell norvig 2003

new inputs and perform humanlike tasks most ai examples that you hear about today – from chessplaying computers to selfdriving cars – rely heavily on deep learning and natural language processing using these technologies computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks by processing large amounts of data and recognizing patterns in the datathe term artificial intelligence was coined in 1956 but ai has become more popular today thanks to increased data volumes advanced algorithms and improvements in computing power and storageearly ai research in the 1950s explored topics like problem solving and symbolic methods in the 1960s the us department of defense took interest in this type of work and began training computers to mimic basic human reasoning for example the defense advanced research projects agency darpa completed street mapping projects in the 1970s and darpa produced intelligent personal assistants in 2003 long before siri alexa or cortana were household namesthis early work paved the way for the automation and formal reasoning that we see in computers today including decision support systems and smart search systems that can be designed to complement and augment human abilitieswhile hollywood movies and science fiction novels depict ai as humanlike robots that take over the world the current evolution of ai technologies isn’t that scary – or quite that smart instead ai has evolved to provide many specific benefits in every industry keep reading for modern examples of artificial intelligence in health care retail and more1950s–1970sneural networksearly work with neural networks stirs excitement for “thinking machines”1980s–2010smachine learningmachine learning becomes popularpresent daydeep learningdeep learning breakthroughs drive ai boomquick watch this video to understand the relationship between ai and machine learning youll see how these two technologies work with examples and a few funny asidesplus this is a great video to share with friends and family to explain artificial intelligence in a way that anyone will understandpeek inside an aienabled hospital an aiassisted retail store and a predictive analytics system that talks this report from harvard business review examines the ai landscape takes a look at the ai workforce – and explains why you shouldn’t swear at siridata is all around us the internet of things iot and sensors have the ability to harness large volumes of data while artificial intelligence ai can learn patterns in the data to automate tasks for a variety of business benefitsfor ai to be used effectively it’s important that the strategy around it feeds into your larger business strategy always taking into account the convergence of people process and technologyai is helping to embed greater smartness into machines but it is not taking over the world says oliver schabenberger sas executive vice president and chief technology officerevery industry has a high demand for ai capabilities – especially question answering systems that can be used for legal assistance patent searches risk notification and medical research other uses of ai includeai applications can provide personalized medicine and xray readings personal health care assistants can act as life coaches reminding you to take your pills exercise or eat healthierai provides virtual shopping capabilities that offer personalized recommendations and discuss purchase options with the consumer stock management and site layout technologies will also be improved with aiai can analyze factory iot data as it streams from connected equipment to forecast expected load and demand using recurrent networks a specific type of deep learning network used with sequence dataartificial intelligence enhances the speed precision and effectiveness of human efforts in financial institutions ai techniques can be used to identify which transactions are likely to be fraudulent adopt fast and accurate credit scoring as well as automate manually intense data management tasksartificial intelligence is not here to replace us it augments our abilities and makes us better at what we do because ai algorithms learn differently than humans they look at things differently they can see relationships and patterns that escape us this human ai partnership offers many opportunities it canartificial intelligence is going to change every industry but we have to understand its limitsthe principle limitation of ai is that it learns from the data there is no other way in which knowledge can be incorporated that means any inaccuracies in the data will be reflected in the results and any additional layers of prediction or analysis have to be added separatelytoday’s ai systems are trained to do a clearly defined task the system that plays poker cannot play solitaire or chess the system that detects fraud cannot drive a car or give you legal advice in fact an ai system that detects health care fraud cannot accurately detect tax fraud or warranty claims fraudin other words these systems are very very specialized they are focused on a single task and are far from behaving like humanslikewise selflearning systems are not autonomous systems the imagined ai technologies that you see in movies and tv are still science fiction but computers that can probe complex data to learn and perfect specific tasks are becoming quite commonai is simplified when you can prepare data for analysis develop models with modern machinelearning algorithms and integrate text analytics all in one product plus you can code projects that combine sas with other languages including python r java or luaai works by combining large amounts of data with fast iterative processing and intelligent algorithms allowing the software to learn automatically from patterns or features in the data ai is a broad field of study that includes many theories methods and technologies as well as the following major subfieldsadditionally several technologies enable and support aiin summary the goal of ai is to provide software that can reason on input and explain on output ai will provide humanlike interactions with software and offer decision support for specific tasks but it’s not a replacement for humans – and won’t be anytime soongetting started with sascustomer supportinsights trendsquick linksprivacy

neural network is a type of machine learning that is made up of interconnected units like neurons that processes information by responding to external inputs relaying information between each unit the process requires multiple passes at the data to find connections and derive meaning from undefined datadeep learning uses huge neural networks with many layers of processing units taking advantage of advances in computing power and improved training techniques to learn complex patterns in large amounts of data common applications include image and speech recognitioncognitive computing is a subfield of ai that strives for a natural humanlike interaction with machines using ai and cognitive computing the ultimate goal is for a machine to simulate human processes through the ability to interpret images and speech – and then speak coherently in response computer vision relies on pattern recognition and deep learning to recognize what’s in a picture or video when machines can process

'artificial intelligence ai the ability of a digital computer or computercontrolled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings the term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans such as the ability to reason discover meaning generalize or learn from past experience since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks—as for example discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency still despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity there are as yet no programs that can match human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge on the other hand some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific tasks so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis computer search engines and voice or handwriting recognitionall but the simplest human behaviour is ascribed to intelligence while even the most complicated insect behaviour is never taken as an indication of intelligence what is the difference consider the behaviour of the digger wasp sphex ichneumoneus when the female wasp returns to her burrow with food she first deposits it on the threshold checks for intruders inside her burrow and only then if the coast is clear carries her food inside the real nature of the wasp’s instinctual behaviour is revealed if the food is moved a few inches away from the entrance to her burrow while she is inside on emerging she will repeat the whole procedure as often as the food is displaced intelligence—conspicuously absent in the case of sphex—must include the ability to adapt to new circumstancespsychologists generally do not characterize human intelligence by just one trait but by the combination of many diverse abilities research in ai has focused chiefly on the following components of intelligence learning reasoning problem solving perception and using languagethere are a number of different forms of learning as applied to artificial intelligence the simplest is learning by trial and error for example a simple computer program for solving mateinone chess problems might try moves at random until mate is found the program might then store the solution with the position so that the next time the computer encountered the same position it would recall the solution this simple memorizing of individual items and procedures—known as rote learning—is relatively easy to implement on a computer more challenging is the problem of implementing what is called generalization generalization involves applying past experience to analogous new situations for example a program that learns the past tense of regular english verbs by rote will not be able to produce the past tense of a word such as jump unless it previously had been presented with jumped whereas a program that is able to generalize can learn the “add ed” rule and so form the past tense of jump based on experience with similar verbsto reason is to draw inferences appropriate to the situation inferences are classified as either deductive or inductive an example of the former is “fred must be in either the museum or the café he is not in the café therefore he is in the museum” and of the latter “previous accidents of this sort were caused by instrument failure therefore this accident was caused by instrument failure” the most significant difference between these forms of reasoning is that in the deductive case the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion whereas in the inductive case the truth of the premise lends support to the conclusion without giving absolute assurance inductive reasoning is common in science where data are collected and tentative models are developed to describe and predict future behaviour—until the appearance of anomalous data forces the model to be revised deductive reasoning is common in mathematics and logic where elaborate structures of irrefutable theorems are built up from a small set of basic axioms and rulesthere has been considerable success in programming computers to draw inferences especially deductive inferences however true reasoning involves more than just drawing inferences it involves drawing inferences relevant to the solution of the particular task or situation this is one of the hardest problems confronting aiproblem solving particularly in artificial intelligence may be characterized as a systematic search through a range of possible actions in order to reach some predefined goal or solution problemsolving methods divide into special purpose and general purpose a specialpurpose method is tailormade for a particular problem and often exploits very specific features of the situation in which the problem is embedded in contrast a generalpurpose method is applicable to a wide variety of problems one generalpurpose technique used in ai is meansend analysis—a stepbystep or incremental reduction of the difference between the current state and the final goal the program selects actions from a list of means—in the case of a simple robot this might consist of pickup putdown moveforward moveback moveleft and moveright—until the goal is reachedmany diverse problems have been solved by artificial intelligence programs some examples are finding the winning move or sequence of moves in a board game devising mathematical proofs and manipulating “virtual objects” in a computergenerated worldin perception the environment is scanned by means of various sensory organs real or artificial and the scene is decomposed into separate objects in various spatial relationships analysis is complicated by the fact that an object may appear different depending on the angle from which it is viewed the direction and intensity of illumination in the scene and how much the object contrasts with the surrounding fieldat present artificial perception is sufficiently well advanced to enable optical sensors to identify individuals autonomous vehicles to drive at moderate speeds on the open road and robots to roam through buildings collecting empty soda cans one of the earliest systems to integrate perception and action was freddy a stationary robot with a moving television eye and a pincer hand constructed at the university of edinburgh scotland during the period 1966–73 under the direction of donald michie freddy was able to recognize a variety of objects and could be instructed to assemble simple artifacts such as a toy car from a random heap of componentsa language is a system of signs having meaning by convention in this sense language need not be confined to the spoken word traffic signs for example form a minilanguage it being a matter of convention that ⚠ means “hazard ahead” in some countries it is distinctive of languages that linguistic units possess meaning by convention and linguistic meaning is very different from what is called natural meaning exemplified in statements such as “those clouds mean rain” and “the fall in pressure means the valve is malfunctioning”an important characteristic of fullfledged human languages—in contrast to birdcalls and traffic signs—is their productivity a productive language can formulate an unlimited variety of sentencesit is relatively easy to write computer programs that seem able in severely restricted contexts to respond fluently in a human language to questions and statements although none of these programs actually understands language they may in principle reach the point where their command of a language is indistinguishable from that of a normal human what then is involved in genuine understanding if even a computer that uses language like a native human speaker is not acknowledged to understand there is no universally agreed upon answer to this difficult question according to one theory whether or not one understands depends not only on one’s behaviour but also on one’s history in order to be said to understand one must have learned the language and have been trained to take one’s place in the linguistic community by means of interaction with other language usersai research follows two distinct and to some extent competing methods the symbolic or “topdown” approach and the connectionist or “bottomup” approach the topdown approach seeks to replicate intelligence by analyzing cognition independent of the biological structure of the brain in terms of the processing of symbols—whence the symbolic label the bottomup approach on the other hand involves creating artificial neural networks in imitation of the brain’s structure—whence the connectionist labelto illustrate the difference between these approaches consider the task of building a system equipped with an optical scanner that recognizes the letters of the alphabet a bottomup approach typically involves training an artificial neural network by presenting letters to it one by one gradually improving performance by “tuning” the network tuning adjusts the responsiveness of different neural pathways to different stimuli in contrast a topdown approach typically involves writing a computer program that compares each letter with geometric descriptions simply put neural activities are the basis of the bottomup approach while symbolic descriptions are the basis of the topdown approachin the fundamentals of learning 1932 edward thorndike a psychologist at columbia university new york city first suggested that human learning consists of some unknown property of connections between neurons in the brain in the organization of behavior 1949 donald hebb a psychologist at mcgill university montreal canada suggested that learning specifically involves strengthening certain patterns of neural activity by increasing the probability weight of induced neuron firing between the associated connections the notion of weighted connections is described in a later section connectionismin 1957 two vigorous advocates of symbolic ai—allen newell a researcher at the rand corporation santa monica california and herbert simon a psychologist and computer scientist at carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pennsylvania—summed up the topdown approach in what they called the physical symbol system hypothesis this hypothesis states that processing structures of symbols is sufficient in principle to produce artificial intelligence in a digital computer and that moreover human intelligence is the result of the same type of symbolic manipulationsduring the 1950s and ’60s the topdown and bottomup approaches were pursued simultaneously and both achieved noteworthy if limited results during the 1970s however bottomup ai was neglected and it was not until the 1980s that this approach again became prominent nowadays both approaches are followed and both are acknowledged as facing difficulties symbolic techniques work in simplified realms but typically break down when confronted with the real world meanwhile bottomup researchers have been unable to replicate the nervous systems of even the simplest living things caenorhabditis elegans a muchstudied worm has approximately 300 neurons whose pattern of interconnections is perfectly known yet connectionist models have failed to mimic even this worm evidently the neurons of connectionist theory are gross oversimplifications of the real thingemploying the methods outlined above ai research attempts to reach one of three goals strong ai applied ai or cognitive simulation strong ai aims to build machines that think the term strong ai was introduced for this category of research in 1980 by the philosopher john searle of the university of california at berkeley the ultimate ambition of strong ai is to produce a machine whose overall intellectual ability is indistinguishable from that of a human being as is described in the section early milestones in ai this goal generated great interest in the 1950s and ’60s but such optimism has given way to an appreciation of the extreme difficulties involved to date progress has been meagre some critics doubt whether research will produce even a system with the overall intellectual ability of an ant in the forseeable future indeed some researchers working in ai’s other two branches view strong ai as not worth pursuingapplied ai also known as advanced information processing aims to produce commercially viable “smart” systems—for example “expert” medical diagnosis systems and stocktrading systems applied ai has enjoyed considerable success as described in the section expert systemsin cognitive simulation computers are used to test theories about how the human mind works—for example theories about how people recognize faces or recall memories cognitive simulation is already a powerful tool in both neuroscience and cognitive psychologythe earliest substantial work in the field of artificial intelligence was done in the mid20th century by the british logician and computer pioneer alan mathison turing in 1935 turing described an abstract computing machine consisting of a limitless memory and a scanner that moves back and forth through the memory symbol by symbol reading what it finds and writing further symbols the actions of the scanner are dictated by a program of instructions that also is stored in the memory in the form of symbols this is turing’s storedprogram concept and implicit in it is the possibility of the machine operating on and so modifying or improving its own program turing’s conception is now known simply as the universal turing machine all modern computers are in essence universal turing machinesduring world war ii turing was a leading cryptanalyst at the government code and cypher school in bletchley park buckinghamshire england turing could not turn to the project of building a storedprogram electronic computing machine until the cessation of hostilities in europe in 1945 nevertheless during the war he gave considerable thought to the issue of machine intelligence one of turing’s colleagues at bletchley park donald michie who later founded the department of machine intelligence and perception at the university of edinburgh later recalled that turing often discussed how computers could learn from experience as well as solve new problems through the use of guiding principles—a process now known as heuristic problem solvingturing gave quite possibly the earliest public lecture london 1947 to mention computer intelligence saying “what we want is a machine that can learn from experience” and that the “possibility of letting the machine alter its own instructions provides the mechanism for this” in 1948 he introduced many of the central concepts of ai in a report entitled “intelligent machinery” however turing did not publish this paper and many of his ideas were later reinvented by others for instance one of turing’s original ideas was to train a network of artificial neurons to perform specific tasks an approach described in the section connectionismat bletchley park turing illustrated his ideas on machine intelligence by reference to chess—a useful source of challenging and clearly defined problems against which proposed methods for problem solving could be tested in principle a chessplaying computer could play by searching exhaustively through all the available moves but in practice this is impossible because it would involve examining an astronomically large number of moves heuristics are necessary to guide a narrower more discriminative search although turing experimented with designing chess programs he had to content himself with theory in the absence of a computer to run his chess program the first true ai programs had to await the arrival of storedprogram electronic digital computersin 1945 turing predicted that computers would one day play very good chess and just over 50 years later in 1997 deep blue a chess computer built by the international business machines corporation ibm beat the reigning world champion garry kasparov in a sixgame match while turing’s prediction came true his expectation that chess programming would contribute to the understanding of how human beings think did not the huge improvement in computer chess since turing’s day is attributable to advances in computer engineering rather than advances in ai—deep blue’s 256 parallel processors enabled it to examine 200 million possible moves per second and to look ahead as many as 14 turns of play many agree with noam chomsky a linguist at the massachusetts institute of technology mit who opined that a computer beating a grandmaster at chess is about as interesting as a bulldozer winning an olympic weightlifting competitionin 1950 turing sidestepped the traditional debate concerning the definition of intelligence introducing a practical test for computer intelligence that is now known simply as the turing test the turing test involves three participants a computer a human interrogator and a human foil the interrogator attempts to determine by asking questions of the other two participants which is the computer all communication is via keyboard and display screen the interrogator may ask questions as penetrating and wideranging as he or she likes and the computer is permitted to do everything possible to force a wrong identification for instance the computer might answer “no” in response to “are you a computer” and might follow a request to multiply one large number by another with a long pause and an incorrect answer the foil must help the interrogator to make a correct identification a number of different people play the roles of interrogator and foil and if a sufficient proportion of the interrogators are unable to distinguish the computer from the human being then according to proponents of turing’s test the computer is considered an intelligent thinking entityin 1991 the american philanthropist hugh loebner started the annual loebner prize competition promising a 100000 payout to the first computer to pass the turing test and awarding 2000 each year to the best effort however no ai program has come close to passing an undiluted turing testthe earliest successful ai program was written in 1951 by christopher strachey later director of the programming research group at the university of oxford strachey’s checkers draughts program ran on the ferranti mark i computer at the university of manchester england by the summer of 1952 this program could play a complete game of checkers at a reasonable speedinformation about the earliest successful demonstration of machine learning was published in 1952 shopper written by anthony oettinger at the university of cambridge ran on the edsac computer shopper’s simulated world was a mall of eight shops when instructed to purchase an item shopper would search for it visiting shops at random until the item was found while searching shopper would memorize a few of the items stocked in each shop visited just as a human shopper might the next time shopper was sent out for the same item or for some other item that it had already located it would go to the right shop straight away this simple form of learning as is pointed out in the introductory section what is intelligence is called rote learningthe first ai program to run in the united states also was a checkers program written in 1952 by arthur samuel for the prototype of the ibm 701 samuel took over the essentials of strachey’s checkers program and over a period of years considerably extended it in 1955 he added features that enabled the program to learn from experience samuel included mechanisms for both rote learning and generalization enhancements that eventually led to his program’s winning one game against a former connecticut checkers champion in 1962samuel’s checkers program was also notable for being one of the first efforts at evolutionary computing his program “evolved” by pitting a modified copy against the current best version of his program with the winner becoming the new standard evolutionary computing typically involves the use of some automatic method of generating and evaluating successive “generations” of a program until a highly proficient solution evolvesa leading proponent of evolutionary computing john holland also wrote test software for the prototype of the ibm 701 computer in particular he helped design a neuralnetwork “virtual” rat that could be trained to navigate through a maze this work convinced holland of the efficacy of the bottomup approach while continuing to consult for ibm holland moved to the university of michigan in 1952 to pursue a doctorate in mathematics he soon switched however to a new interdisciplinary program in computers and information processing later known as communications science created by arthur burks one of the builders of eniac and its successor edvac in his 1959 dissertation for most likely the world’s first computer science phd holland proposed a new type of computer—a multiprocessor computer—that would assign each artificial neuron in a network to a separate processor in 1985 daniel hillis solved the engineering difficulties to build the first such computer the 65536processor thinking machines corporation supercomputerholland joined the faculty at michigan after graduation and over the next four decades directed much of the research into methods of automating evolutionary computing a process now known by the term genetic algorithms systems implemented in holland’s laboratory included a chess program models of singlecell biological organisms and a classifier system for controlling a simulated gaspipeline network genetic algorithms are no longer restricted to “academic” demonstrations however in one important practical application a genetic algorithm cooperates with a witness to a crime in order to generate a portrait of the criminalthe ability to reason logically is an important aspect of intelligence and has always been a major focus of ai research an important landmark in this area was a theoremproving program written in 1955–56 by allen newell and j clifford shaw of the rand corporation and herbert simon of the carnegie mellon university the logic theorist as the program became known was designed to prove theorems from principia mathematica 1910–13 a threevolume work by the british philosophermathematicians alfred north whitehead and bertrand russell in one instance a proof devised by the program was more elegant than the proof given in the booksnewell simon and shaw went on to write a more powerful program the general problem solver or gps the first version of gps ran in 1957 and work continued on the project for about a decade gps could solve an impressive variety of puzzles using a trial and error approach however one criticism of gps and similar programs that lack any learning capability is that the program’s intelligence is entirely secondhand coming from whatever information the programmer explicitly includestwo of the bestknown early ai programs eliza and parry gave an eerie semblance of intelligent conversation details of both were first published in 1966 eliza written by joseph weizenbaum of mit’s ai laboratory simulated a human therapist parry written by stanford university psychiatrist kenneth colby simulated a human paranoiac psychiatrists who were asked to decide whether they were communicating with parry or a human paranoiac were often unable to tell nevertheless neither parry nor eliza could reasonably be described as intelligent parry’s contributions to the conversation were canned—constructed in advance by the programmer and stored away in the computer’s memory eliza too relied on canned sentences and simple programming tricksin the course of their work on the logic theorist and gps newell simon and shaw developed their information processing language ipl a computer language tailored for ai programming at the heart of ipl was a highly flexible data structure that they called a list a list is simply an ordered sequence of items of data some or all of the items in a list may themselves be lists this scheme leads to richly branching structuresin 1960 john mccarthy combined elements of ipl with the lambda calculus a formal mathematicallogical system to produce the programming language lisp list processor which remains the principal language for ai work in the united states the lambda calculus itself was invented in 1936 by the princeton logician alonzo church while he was investigating the abstract entscheidungsproblem or “decision problem” for predicate logic—the same problem that turing had been attacking when he invented the universal turing machinethe logic programming language prolog programmation en logique was conceived by alain colmerauer at the university of aixmarseille france where the language was first implemented in 1973 prolog was further developed by the logician robert kowalski a member of the ai group at the university of edinburgh this language makes use of a powerful theoremproving technique known as resolution invented in 1963 at the us atomic energy commission’s argonne national laboratory in illinois by the british logician alan robinson prolog can determine whether or not a given statement follows logically from other given statements for example given the statements “all logicians are rational” and “robinson is a logician” a prolog program responds in the affirmative to the query “robinson is rational” prolog is widely used for ai work especially in europe and japanresearchers at the institute for new generation computer technology in tokyo have used prolog as the basis for sophisticated logic programming languages known as fifthgeneration languages these are in use on nonnumerical parallel computers developed at the instituteother recent work includes the development of languages for reasoning about timedependent data such as “the account was paid yesterday” these languages are based on tense logic which permits statements to be located in the flow of time tense logic was invented in 1953 by the philosopher arthur prior at the university of canterbury christchurch new zealandto cope with the bewildering complexity of the real world scientists often ignore less relevant details for instance physicists often ignore friction and elasticity in their models in 1970 marvin minsky and seymour papert of the mit ai laboratory proposed that likewise ai research should focus on developing programs capable of intelligent behaviour in simpler artificial environments known as microworlds much research has focused on the socalled blocks world which consists of coloured blocks of various shapes and sizes arrayed on a flat surfacean early success of the microworld approach was shrdlu written by terry winograd of mit details of the program were published in 1972 shrdlu controlled a robot arm that operated above a flat surface strewn with play blocks both the arm and the blocks were virtual shrdlu would respond to commands typed in natural english such as “will you please stack up both of the red blocks and either a green cube or a pyramid” the program could also answer questions about its own actionsalthough shrdlu was initially hailed as a major breakthrough winograd soon announced that the program was in fact a dead end the techniques pioneered in the program proved unsuitable for application in wider more interesting worlds moreover the appearance that shrdlu gave of understanding the blocks microworld and english statements concerning it was in fact an illusion shrdlu had no idea what a green block wasanother product of the microworld approach was shakey a mobile robot developed at the stanford research institute by bertram raphael nils nilsson and others during the period 1968–72 the robot occupied a specially built microworld consisting of walls doorways and a few simply shaped wooden blocks each wall had a carefully painted baseboard to enable the robot to “see” where the wall met the floor a simplification of reality that is typical of the microworld approach shakey had about a dozen basic abilities such as turn push and climbrampcritics pointed out the highly simplified nature of shakey’s environment and emphasized that despite these simplifications shakey operated excruciatingly slowly a series of actions that a human could plan out and execute in minutes took shakey daysthe greatest success of the microworld approach is a type of program known as an expert system described in the next sectionwe welcome suggested improvements to any of our

is also a core part of ai learning without any kind of supervision requires an ability to identify patterns in streams of inputs whereas learning with adequate supervision involves classification and numerical regressions classification determines the category an object belongs to and regression deals with obtaining a set of numerical input or output examples thereby discovering functions enabling the generation of suitable outputs from respective inputs mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a welldefined branch of theoretical computer science often referred to as computational learning theorymachine perception deals with the capability to use sensory inputs to deduce the different aspects of the world while computer vision is the power to

imitates staley kubrick who had worked on the project before his death it is as if spielberg is playing with kubricks fans he films that part of the film exactly like the dead master would do it reproducing very well that very disturbing mood from full metal jackets first half a clockwork orange and paths of gloryit feels like a game spielberg knows that people could not this film and not ask i wonder how would kubrick have done it or start comparing the two to spielbergs disadvantage so he answers the question showing which film kubrick would do in the 1st hour the exact moment when the mom leaves the boyrobot which proves his control over the medium something no one ever questioned and then moving on to his film with the human content and theme he thinks he can provide something you can easily question his ability now he has to prove he can do a better job so he extends and overfilms to the point of exhaustion his vision putting as much visual and emotion you could expect overall it felt kind of boring and emptyso its like i gave you kubrick and more by the way wasnt my vision more interesting no it wasnt steve you proved you are a talented director enough to bring to life a

with building smart machines capable of performing tasks the typically require human intelligence ai is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industrycan machines think — alan turing 1950less than a decade after breaking the nazi encryption machine enigma and helping the allied forces win world war ii mathematician alan turing changed history a second time with a simple question can machines thinkturings paper computing machinery and intelligence 1950 and its subsequent turing test established the fundamental goal and vision of artificial intelligenceat its core ai is the branch of computer science that aims to answer turings question in the affirmative it is the endeavor to replicate or simulate human intelligence in machinesthe expansive goal of artificial intelligence has given rise to many questions and debates so much so that no singular definition of the field is universally acceptedthe major limitation in defining ai as simply building machines that are intelligent is that it doesnt actually explain what artificial intelligence is what makes a machine intelligentin their groundbreaking textbook artificial intelligence a modern approach authors stuart russell and peter norvig approach the question by unifying their work around the theme of intelligent agents in machines with this in mind ai is the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions russel and norvig viiinorvig and russell go on to explore four different approaches that have historically defined the field of aithe first two ideas concern thought processes and reasoning while the others deal with behavior norvig and russell focus particularly on rational agents that act to achieve the best outcome noting all the skills needed for the turing test also allow an agent to act rationally russel and norvig 4patrick winston the ford professor of artificial intelligence and computer science at mit defines ai as algorithms enabled by constraints exposed by representations that support models targeted at loops that tie thinking perception and action togetherwhile these definitions may seem abstract to the average person they help focus the field as an area of computer science and provide a blueprint for infusing machines and programs with machine learning and other subsets of artificial intelligencewhile addressing a crowd at the japan ai experience in 2017 datarobot ceo jeremy achin began his speech by offering the following definition of how ai is used todayai is a computer system able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence many of these artificial intelligence systems are powered by machine learning some of them are powered by deep learning and some of them are powered by very boring things like rulesartificial intelligence generally false under two broad categoriesnarrow ai is all around us and is easily the most successful realization of artificial intelligence to date with its focus on performing specific tasks narrow ai has experienced numerous breakthroughs in the last decade that have had significant societal benefits and have contributed to the economic vitality of the nation according to preparing for the future of artificial intelligence a 2016 report released by the obama administrationa few examples of narrow ai includemuch of narrow ai is powered by breakthroughs in machine learning and deep learning understanding the difference between artificial intelligence machine learning and deep learning can be confusing venture capitalist frank chen provides a good overview of how to distinguish between them notingartificial intelligence is a set of algorithms and intelligence to try to mimic human intelligence machine learning is one of them and deep learning is one of those machine learning techniquessimply put machine learning feeds a computer data and uses statistical techniques to help it learn how to get progressively better at a task without having been specifically programmed for that task eliminating the need for millions of lines of written code machine learning consists of both supervised learning using labeled data sets and unsupervised learning using unlabeled data setsdeep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through a biologicallyinspired neural network architecture the neural networks contain a number of hidden layers through which the data is processed allowing the machine to go deep in its learning making connections and weighting input for the best resultsthe creation of a machine with humanlevel intelligence that can be applied to any task is the holy grail for many ai researchers but the quest for agi has been fraught with difficultythe search for a universal algorithm for learning and acting in any environment russel and norvig 27 isnt new but time hasnt eased the difficulty of essentially creating a machine with a full set of cognitive abilitiesagi has long been the muse of dystopian science fiction in which superintelligent robots overrun humanity but experts agree its not something we need to worry about anytime soonintelligent robots and artificial beings first appeared in the ancient greek myths of antiquity aristotles development of the syllogism and its use of deductive reasoning was a key moment in mankinds quest to understand its own intelligence while the roots are long and deep the history

in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions the term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problemsolvingthe ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goalwhen most people hear the term artificial intelligence the first thing they usually think of is robots thats because bigbudget films and novels weave stories about humanlike machines that wreak havoc on earth but nothing could be further from the truthartificial intelligence is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks from the most simple to those that are even more complex the goals of artificial intelligence include learning reasoning and perceptionas technology advances previous benchmarks that defined artificial intelligence become outdated for example machines that calculate basic functions or recognize text through optimal character recognition are no longer considered to embody artificial intelligence since this function is now taken for granted as an inherent computer functionai is continuously evolving to benefit many different industries machines are wired using a crossdisciplinary approach based in mathematics computer science linguistics psychology and morealgorithms often play a very important part in the structure of artificial intelligence where simple algorithms are used in simple applications while more complex ones help frame strong artificial intelligencethe applications for artificial intelligence are endless the technology can be applied to many different sectors and industries ai is being tested and used in the healthcare industry for dosing drugs and different treatment in patients and for surgical procedures in the operating roomother examples of machines with artificial intelligence include computers that play chess and selfdriving cars each of these machines must weigh the consequences of any action they take as each action will impact the end result in chess the end result is winning the game for selfdriving cars the computer system must account for all external data and compute it to act in a way that prevents a collisionartificial intelligence also has applications in the financial industry where it is used to detect and flag activity in banking and finance such as unusual debit card usage and large account deposits—all of which help a banks fraud department applications for ai are also being used to help streamline and make trading easier this is done by making supply demand and pricing of securities easier to estimateartificial intelligence can be divided into two different categories weak and strong weak artificial intelligence embodies a system designed to carry out one particular job weak ai systems include video games such as the chess example from above and personal assistants such as amazons alexa and apples siri you ask the assistant a question it answers it for youstrong artificial intelligence are systems that carry on the tasks considered to be humanlike these tend to be more complex and complicated systems they are programmed to handle situations in which they may be required to problem solve without having a person intervene these kinds of systems can be found in applications like selfdriving cars or in hospital operating roomssince its beginning artificial intelligence has come under scrutiny from scientists and the public alike one common theme is the idea that machines will become so highly developed that humans will not be able to keep up and they will take off on their own redesigning themselves at an exponential rateanother is that machines can hack into peoples privacy and even be weaponized other arguments debate the ethics of artificial intelligence and whether intelligent systems such as robots should be treated with the same rights as humansselfdriving cars have been fairly controversial as their machines tend to be designed for the lowest possible risk and the least casualties if presented with a scenario of colliding with one person or another at the same time these cars would calculate the option that would cause the least amount of damageanother contentious issue many people have with artificial intelligence is how it may affect human employment with many industries looking to automate certain jobs through the use of intelligent machinery there is a concern that people would be pushed out of the workforce selfdriving cars may remove the need for taxis and carshare programs while manufacturers may easily replace human labor with machines making peoples skills

also known as artificial general intelligence is an ai system with generalized human cognitive abilities when presented with an unfamiliar task a strong ai system is able to find a solution without

cloud offerings include amazon ai services ibm watson assistant microsoft cognitive services and google ai serviceswhile ai tools present a range of new functionality for businesses the use of artificial intelligence raises ethical questions this is because deep learning algorithms which underpin many of the most advanced ai tools are only as smart as the data they are given in training because a human selects what data should be used for training an ai program the potential for human bias is inherent and must be monitored closelysome industry experts believe that the term artificial intelligence is too closely linked to popular culture causing the general public to have unrealistic fears about artificial intelligence and improbable expectations about how it will change the workplace and life in general researchers and marketers hope the label augmented intelligence which has a more neutral connotation will help people understand that ai will simply improve products and

from the kind of ai systems that exist today to sentient systems which do not yet exist his categories are as followsai is incorporated into a variety of different types of technology here are seven examplesartificial intelligence has made its way into a number of areas here are six examplesthe application of ai in the realm of selfdriving cars raises security as well as ethical concerns cars can be hacked and when an autonomous vehicle is involved in an accident liability is unclear autonomous vehicles may also be put in a position where an accident is unavoidable forcing the programming to make an ethical decision about how to minimize damageanother major concern is the potential for abuse of ai tools hackers are starting to use sophisticated machine learning tools to gain access to sensitive systems complicating the issue of security beyond its current statedeep learningbased video and audio generation tools also present bad actors with the tools necessary to create socalled deepfakes convincingly fabricated videos of public figures saying or doing things that never took placedespite these potential risks there are few regulations governing the use ai tools and where laws

circumstances machine learning the science of getting a computer to act without programming deep learning is a subset of machine learning that in very simple terms can be thought of as the automation of predictive analytics there are three types of machine learning algorithms supervised learning data sets are labeled so that patterns can be detected and used to label new data sets unsupervised learning data sets arent labeled and are sorted according to similarities or differences reinforcement learning data sets arent labeled but after performing an action or several actions the ai system is given feedback machine vision the science of allowing computers to see this technology captures and analyzes visual information using a camera analogtodigital conversion and digital signal processing it is often compared to human eyesight but machine vision isnt bound by biology and can be programmed to see through walls for example it is used in a range of applications from signature identification to medical image analysis computer vision which is focused on machinebased image processing is often conflated with machine vision natural language processing nlp the processing of human and not computer language by a computer program one of the older and best known examples of nlp is spam detection which looks at the subject line and the text of an email and decides if its junk current approaches to nlp are based on machine learning nlp tasks include text translation sentiment analysis and speech recognition robotics a field of engineering focused on the design and manufacturing of robots robots are often used to perform tasks that are difficult for humans to perform or perform consistently they are used in assembly lines for car production or by nasa to move large objects in space researchers are also using machine learning to build robots that can interact in social settings selfdriving cars these use a combination of computer vision image recognition

of the field minsky and mccarthy described artificial intelligence as any task performed by a program or a machine that if a human carried out the same activity we would say the human had to apply intelligence to accomplish the taskthat obviously is a fairly broad definition which is why you will sometimes see arguments over whether something is truly ai or notai systems will typically demonstrate at least some of the following behaviors associated with human intelligence planning learning reasoning problem solving knowledge representation perception motion and manipulation and to a lesser extent social intelligence and creativityai is ubiquitous today used to recommend what you should buy next online to understand what you say to virtual assistants such as amazons alexa and apples siri to recognise who and what is in a photo to spot spam or detect credit card fraudartificial intelligence how to build the business caseai might be a hot topic but youll still need to justify those projectsread moreat a very high level artificial intelligence can be split into two broad types narrow ai and general ainarrow ai is what we see all around us in computers today intelligent systems that have been taught or learned how to carry out specific tasks without being explicitly programmed how to do sothis type of machine intelligence is evident in the speech and language recognition of the siri virtual assistant on the apple iphone in the visionrecognition systems on selfdriving cars in the recommendation engines that suggest products you might like based on what you bought in the past unlike humans these systems can only learn or be taught how to do specific tasks which is why they are called narrow aithere are a vast number of emerging applications for narrow ai interpreting video feeds from drones carrying out visual inspections of infrastructure such as oil pipelines organizing personal and business calendars responding to simple customerservice queries coordinating with other intelligent systems to carry out tasks like booking a hotel at a suitable time and location helping radiologists to spot potential tumors in xrays flagging inappropriate content online detecting wear and tear in elevators from data gathered by iot devices the list goes on and onartificial general intelligence is very different and is the type of adaptable intellect found in humans a flexible form of intelligence capable of learning how to carry out vastly different tasks anything from haircutting to building spreadsheets or to reason about a wide variety of topics based on its accumulated experience this is the sort of ai more commonly seen in movies the likes of hal in 2001 or skynet in the terminator but which doesnt exist today and ai experts are fiercely divided over how soon it will become a realityspecial report how to implement ai and machine learning free pdfa survey conducted among four groups of experts in 201213 by ai researchers vincent c müller and philosopher nick bostrom reported a 50 percent chance that artificial general intelligence agi would be developed between 2040 and 2050 rising to 90 percent by 2075 the group went even further predicting that socalled superintelligence which bostrom defines as any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest was expected some 30 years after the achievement of agithat said some ai experts believe such projections are wildly optimistic given our limited understanding of the human brain and believe that agi is still centuries awaythere is a broad body of research in ai much of which feeds into and complements each othercurrently enjoying something of a resurgence machine learning is where a computer system is fed large amounts of data which it then uses to learn how to carry out a specific task such as understanding speech or captioning a photographkey to the process of machine learning are neural networks these are braininspired networks of interconnected layers of algorithms called neurons that feed data into each other and which can be trained to carry out specific tasks by modifying the importance attributed to input data as it passes between the layers during training of these neural networks the weights attached to different inputs will continue to be varied until the output from the neural network is very close to what is desired at which point the network will have learned how to carry out a particular taska subset of machine learning is deep learning where neural networks are expanded into sprawling networks with a huge number of layers that are trained using massive amounts of data it is these deep neural networks that have fueled the current leap forward in the ability of computers to carry out task like speech recognition and computer visiondownload now httpswwwtechrepubliccomresourcelibrarywhitepapersspecialreporthowtoimplementaiandmachinelearningfreepdfit leaders guide to deep learningthere are various types of neural networks with different strengths and weaknesses recurrent neural networks are a type of neural net particularly well suited to language processing and speech recognition while convolutional neural networks are more commonly used in image recognition the design of neural networks is also evolving with researchers recently refining a more effective form of deep neural network called long shortterm memory or lstm allowing it to operate fast enough to be used in ondemand systems like google translatethe structure and training of deep neural networksanother area of ai research is evolutionary computation which borrows from darwins famous theory of natural selection and sees genetic algorithms undergo random mutations and combinations between generations in an attempt to evolve the optimal solution to a given problemthis approach has even been used to help design ai models effectively using ai to help build ai this use of evolutionary algorithms to optimize neural networks is called neuroevolution and could have an important role to play in helping design efficient ai as the use of intelligent systems becomes more prevalent particularly as demand for data scientists often outstrips supply the technique was recently showcased by uber ai labs which released papers on using genetic algorithms to train deep neural networks for reinforcement learning problemsfinally there are expert systems where computers are programmed with rules that allow them to take a series of decisions based on a large number of inputs allowing that machine to mimic the behavior of a human expert in a specific domain an example of these knowledgebased systems might be for example an autopilot system flying a planethe biggest breakthroughs for ai research in recent years have been in the field of machine learning in particular within the field of deep learningthis has been driven in part by the easy availability of data but even more so by an explosion in parallel computing power in recent years during which time the use of gpu clusters to train machinelearning systems has become more prevalentnot only do these clusters offer vastly more powerful systems for training machinelearning models but they are now widely available as cloud services over the internet over time the major tech firms the likes of google and microsoft have moved to using specialized chips tailored to both running and more recently training machinelearning modelsan example of one of these custom chips is googles tensor processing unit tpu the latest version of which accelerates the rate at which useful machinelearning models built using googles tensorflow software library can infer information from data as well as the rate at which they can be trainedthese chips are not just used to train up models for deepmind and google brain but also the models that underpin google translate and the image recognition in google photo as well as services that allow the public to build machine learning models using googles tensorflow research cloud the second generation of these chips was unveiled at googles io conference in may last year with an array of these new tpus able to train a google machinelearning model used for translation in half the time it would take an array of the topend graphics processing units gpusas mentioned machine learning is a subset of ai and is generally split into two main categories supervised and unsupervised learningsupervised learninga common technique for teaching ai systems is by training them using a very large number of labeled examples these machinelearning systems are fed huge amounts of data which has been annotated to highlight the features of interest these might be photos labeled to indicate whether they contain a dog or written sentences that have footnotes to indicate whether the word bass relates to music or a fish once trained the system can then apply these labels can to new data for example to a dog in a photo thats just been uploadedthis process of teaching a machine by example is called supervised learning and the role of labeling these examples is commonly carried out by online workers employed through platforms like amazon mechanical turksee also how artificial intelligence is taking call centers to the next leveltraining these systems typically requires vast amounts of data with some systems needing to scour millions of examples to learn how to carry out a task effectively although this is increasingly possible in an age of big data and widespread data mining training datasets are huge and growing in size googles open images dataset has about nine million images while its labeled video repository youtube8m links to seven million labeled videos imagenet one of the early databases of this kind has more than 14 million categorized images compiled over two years it was put together by nearly 50000 people most of whom were recruited through amazon mechanical turk who checked sorted and labeled almost one billion candidate picturesin the long run having access to huge labelled datasets may also prove less important than access to large amounts of compute powerin recent years generative adversarial networks gans have shown how machinelearning systems that are fed a small amount of labelled data can then generate huge amounts of fresh data to teach themselvesthis approach could lead to the rise of semisupervised learning where systems can learn how to carry out tasks using a far smaller amount of labelled data than is necessary for training systems using supervised learning todayunsupervised learningin contrast unsupervised learning uses a different approach where algorithms try to identify patterns in data looking for similarities that can be used to categorise that dataan example might be clustering together fruits that weigh a similar amount or cars with a similar engine sizethe algorithm isnt setup in advance to pick out specific types of data it simply looks for data that can be grouped by its similarities for example google news grouping together stories on similar topics each dayreinforcement learninga crude analogy for reinforcement learning is rewarding a pet with a treat when it performs a trickin reinforcement learning the system attempts to maximize a reward based on its input data basically going through a process of trial and error until it arrives at the best possible outcomean example of reinforcement learning is google deepminds deep qnetwork which has been used to best human performance in a variety of classic video games the system is fed pixels from each game and determines various information such as the distance between objects on screenby also looking at the score achieved in each game the system builds a model of which action will maximize the score in different circumstances for instance in the case of the video game breakout where the paddle should be moved to in order to intercept the ballmany airelated technologies are approaching or have already reached the peak of inflated expectations in gartners hype cycle with the backlashdriven trough of disillusionment lying in waitgoogles deepmind and the nhs a glimpse of what ai means for the future of healthcarethe google subsidiary has struck a series of deals with organisations in the uk health service so whats really happeningread morewith ai playing an increasingly major role in modern software and services each of the major tech firms is battling to develop robust machinelearning technology for use inhouse and to sell to the public via cloud serviceseach regularly makes headlines for breaking new ground in ai research although it is probably google with its deepmind ai alphago that has probably made the biggest impact on the public awareness of aiall of the major cloud platforms amazon web services microsoft azure and google cloud platform provide access to gpu arrays for training and running machine learning models with google also gearing up to let users use its tensor processing units custom chips whose design is optimized for training and running machinelearning modelsall of the necessary associated infrastructure and services are available from the big three the cloudbased data stores capable of holding the vast amount of data needed to train machinelearning models services to transform data to prepare it for analysis visualisation tools to display the results clearly and software that simplifies the building of modelsthese cloud platforms are even simplifying the creation of custom machinelearning models with google recently revealing a service that automates the creation of ai models called cloud automl this draganddrop service builds custom imagerecognition models and requires the user to have no machinelearning expertisecloudbased machinelearning services are constantly evolving and at the start of 2018 amazon revealed a host of new aws offerings designed to streamline the process of training up machinelearning modelsfor those firms that dont want to build their own machine learning models but instead want to consume aipowered ondemand services such as voice vision and language recognition microsoft azure stands out for the breadth of services on offer closely followed by google cloud platform and then aws meanwhile ibm alongside its more general ondemand offerings is also attempting to sell sectorspecific ai services aimed at everything from healthcare to retail grouping these offerings together under its ibm watson umbrella and recently investing 2bn in buying the weather channel to unlock a trove of data to augment its ai servicesinternally each of the tech giants and others such as facebook use ai to help drive myriad public services serving search results offering recommendations recognizing people and things in photos ondemand translation spotting spam the list is extensivebut one of the most visible manifestations of this ai war has been the rise of virtual assistants such as apples siri amazons alexa the google assistant and microsoft cortanathe amazon echo plus is a smart speaker with access to amazons alexa virtual assistant built inrelying heavily on voice recognition and naturallanguage processing as well as needing an immense corpus to draw upon to answer queries a huge amount of tech goes into developing these assistantsbut while apples siri

downloaddespite being built into windows 10 cortana has had a particularly rough time of late with the suggestion that major pc makers will build alexa into laptops adding to speculation about whether cortanas days are numbered although microsoft was quick to reject thisitd be a big mistake to think the us tech giants have the field of ai sewn up chinese firms alibaba baidu and lenovo are investing heavily in ai in fields ranging from ecommerce to autonomous driving as a country china is pursuing a threestep plan to turn ai into a core industry for the country one that will be worth 150 billion

manufacturers around the worldthe combination of weak privacy laws huge investment concerted datagathering and big data analytics by major firms like baidu alibaba and tencent means that some analysts believe china will have an advantage over the us when it comes to future ai research with one analyst describing the chances of china taking the lead over the us as 500 to one in chinas favorwhile you could try to build your own gpu array at home and start training a machinelearning model probably the easiest way to experiment with airelated services is via the cloudall of the major tech firms offer various ai services from the infrastructure to build and train your own machinelearning models through to web services that allow you to access aipowered tools such as speech language vision and sentiment recognition on demandtheres too many to put together a comprehensive list but some recent highlights include in 2009 google showed it was possible for its selfdriving toyota prius to complete more than 10 journeys of 100 miles each setting society on a path towards driverless vehiclesin 2011 the computer system ibm watson made headlines worldwide when it won the us quiz show jeopardy beating two of the best players the show had ever produced to win the show watson used natural language processing and analytics on vast repositories of data that it processed to answer humanposed questions often in a fraction of a secondibm watson competes on jeopardy in january 14 2011in june 2012 it became apparent just how good machinelearning systems were getting at computer vision with google training a system to recognise an internet favorite pictures of catssince watsons win perhaps the most famous demonstration of the efficacy of machinelearning systems was the 2016 triumph of the google deepmind alphago ai over a human grandmaster in go an ancient chinese game whose complexity stumped computers for decades go has about 200 moves per turn compared to about 20 in chess over the course of a game of go there are so many possible moves that searching through each of them in advance to identify the best play is too costly from a computational point of view instead alphago was trained how to play the game by taking moves played by human experts in 30 million go games and feeding them into deeplearning neural networkstraining these deep learning networks can take a very long time requiring vast amounts of data to be ingested and iterated over as the system gradually refines its model in order to achieve the best outcomehowever more recently google refined the training process with alphago zero a system that played completely random games against itself and then learnt from the results at last years prestigious neural information processing systems nips conference google deepmind ceo demis hassabis revealed alphago had also mastered the games of chess and shogiand ai continues to sprint past new milestones last year a system trained by openai

phoenixfake newswe are on the verge of having neural networks that can create photorealistic images or replicate someones voice in a pitchperfect fashion with that comes the potential for hugely disruptive social change such as no longer being able to trust video or audio footage as genuine concerns are also starting to be raised about how such technologies will be used to misappropriate peoples image with tools already being created to convincingly splice famous actresses into adult filmsspeech and language recognitionmachinelearning systems have helped computers recognize what people are saying with an accuracy of almost 95 percent recently microsofts artificial intelligence and research group reported it had developed a system able to transcribe spoken english as accurately as human transcriberswith researchers pursuing a goal of 99 percent accuracy expect speaking to computers to become the norm alongside more traditional forms of humanmachine interactionfacial recognition and surveillancein recent years the accuracy of facialrecognition systems has leapt forward to the point where chinese tech giant baidu says it can match faces with 99 percent accuracy providing the face is clear enough on the video while police forces in western countries have generally only trialled using facialrecognition systems at large events in china the authorities are mounting a nationwide program to connect cctv across the country to facial recognition and to use ai systems to track suspects and suspicious behavior and are also trialling the use of facialrecognition glasses by policealthough privacy regulations vary across the world its likely this more intrusive use of ai technology including ai that can recognize emotions will gradually become more widespread elsewherehealthcareai could eventually have a dramatic impact on healthcare helping radiologists to pick out tumors in xrays aiding researchers in spotting genetic sequences related to diseases and identifying molecules that could lead to more effective drugsthere have been trials of airelated technology in hospitals across the world these include ibms watson clinical decision support tool which is trained by oncologists at memorial sloan kettering cancer center and the use of google deepmind systems by the uks national health service where it will help spot eye abnormalities and streamline the process of screening patients for head and neck cancersagain it depends who you ask as aipowered systems have grown more capable so warnings of the downsides have become more diretesla and spacex ceo elon musk has claimed that ai is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization as part of his push for stronger regulatory oversight and more responsible research into mitigating the downsides of ai he set up openai a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company that aims to promote and develop friendly ai that will benefit society as a whole similarly the esteemed physicist stephen hawking has warned that once a sufficiently advanced ai is created it will rapidly advance to the point at which it vastly outstrips human capabilities a phenomenon known as the singularity and could pose an existential threat to the human raceyet the notion that humanity is on the verge of an ai explosion that will dwarf our intellect seems ludicrous to some ai researcherschris bishop microsofts director of research in cambridge england stresses how different the narrow intelligence of ai today is from the general intelligence of humans saying that when people worry about terminator and the rise of the machines and so on utter nonsense yes at best such discussions are decades awaythe possibility of artificially intelligent systems

jobs in the warehouse so its not a given that manual and robotic labor will continue to grow handinhandamazon bought kiva robotics in 2012 and today uses kiva robots throughout its warehousesfully autonomous selfdriving vehicles arent a reality yet but by some predictions the selfdriving trucking industry alone is poised to take over 17 million jobs in the next decade even without considering the impact on couriers and taxi driversyet some of the easiest jobs to automate wont even require robotics at present there are millions of people working in administration entering and copying data between systems chasing and booking appointments for companies as software gets better at automatically updating systems and flagging the information thats important so the need for administrators will fallas with every technological shift new jobs will be created to replace those lost however whats uncertain is whether these new roles will be created rapidly enough to offer employment to those

intelligence also known as ai is a 2001 american science fiction drama film directed by steven spielberg the screenplay by spielberg and screen story by ian watson were loosely based on the 1969 short story supertoys last all summer long by brian aldiss the film was produced by kathleen kennedy spielberg and bonnie curtis it stars haley joel osment jude law frances oconnor brendan gleeson and william hurt set in a futuristic postclimate change society ai tells the story of david osment a childlike android uniquely programmed with the ability to lovedevelopment of ai originally began with producerdirector stanley kubrick after he acquired the rights to aldiss story in the early 1970s kubrick hired a series of writers until the mid1990s including brian aldiss bob shaw ian watson and sara maitland the film languished in protracted development for years partly because kubrick felt computergenerated imagery was not advanced enough to create the david character whom he believed no child actor would convincingly portray in 1995 kubrick handed ai to spielberg but the film did not gain momentum until kubricks death in 1999 spielberg remained close to watsons film treatment for the screenplaythe film received positive reviews and grossed approximately 235 million the film was nominated for two academy awards at the 74th academy awards for best visual effects and best original score by john williamsin a 2016 bbc poll of 177 critics around the world steven spielbergs ai artificial intelligence was voted the eightythirdgreatest film since 20003 ai is dedicated to stanley kubrickin the late 22nd century rising sea levels from global warming have wiped out coastal cities such as amsterdam venice and new york and drastically reduced the worlds population a new type of robots called mecha advanced humanoids capable of displaying thought and emotion have been createdin madison david a mecha that resembles a human child and is programmed to display love for his owners is given to henry swinton and his wife monica whose son martin after contracting a rare disease has been placed in suspended animation and is not expected to recover monica feels uneasy with david but eventually warms to him and activates his imprinting protocol causing him to have an enduring childlike love for her david is befriended by teddy a robotic teddy bear that belonged to martinmartin is unexpectedly cured of his disease and brought home as he recovers he grows jealous of david he tricks david into entering the parentss bedroom at night and cutting off a lock of monicas hair this upsets the parents particularly henry who fears david intended to injure them at a pool party one of martins friends pokes david with a knife activating davids selfprotection programming david grabs martin and they fall into the pool martin is saved from drowning but henry persuades monica to return david to his creators for destruction instead she abandons david and teddy in the forest she warns david to avoid all humans and tells him to find other unregistered mecha who can protect himdavid is captured for an antimecha flesh fair outside haddonfield where obsolete unlicensed mecha are destroyed before cheering crowds david is placed on a platform with gigolo joe a male sex worker mecha who is on the run after being framed for murder before the pair can be destroyed with acid the crowd thinking david is a real boy since he unlike other mechas desperately cries begins booing and throwing things at the shows emcee in the chaos david and joe escape since joe survived thanks to david he agrees to help him find blue fairy whom david remembers from the adventures of pinocchio and believes can turn him into a real boy allowing monica to love him and take him homejoe and david make their way to the decadent resort town of rouge city where dr know a holographic answer engine directs them to the top of rockefeller center in the flooded ruins of manhattan there david meets a copy of himself and destroys it he then meets professor hobby his creator who tells david he was built in the image of the professors dead son david the engineers are thrilled by his ability to have a will without being programmed he reveals they have been monitoring him to see how he progresses and altered dr know to guide him to manhattan back to the lab he was created in david finds more copies of him as well as female versions called darlene that have been made theredisheartened david lets himself fall from a ledge of the building he is rescued by joe flying an amphibicopter he has stolen from the police who were pursuing him david tells joe he saw the blue fairy underwater and wants to go down to meet her joe is captured by the authorities who snare him with an electromagnet before he is pulled up he activates the amphibicopters dive function for david telling him to remember him for he declares i am i was david and teddy dive to see the fairy which turns out to be a statue at the nowsunken coney island the two become trapped when the wonder wheel falls on their vehicle david repeatedly asks the fairy to turn him into a real boy eventually the ocean freezes and davids power source is depletedtwo thousand years later humans are extinct and manhattan is buried under glacial ice the mecha have evolved into an advanced siliconbased form called specialists they find david and teddy and discover they are original mecha who knew living humans making them special the specialists revive david and teddy david walks to the frozen fairy statue which collapses when he touches it the mecha use davids memories to reconstruct the swinton home david asks the specialists if they can make him human but they cannot however he insists they recreate monica from dna from the lock of her hair which teddy has kept the mecha warn david that the clone can live for only a day and that the process cannot be repeated david spends a joyous day with monica and teddy at the end of which\u200d—\u200cbefore she drifts off to sleep\u200d—\u200cmonica tells david i do love you i have always loved you david falls asleep as wellkubrick began development on an adaptation of supertoys last all summer long in the late 1970s hiring the storys author brian aldiss to write a film treatment in 1985 kubrick asked steven spielberg to direct the film with kubrick producing6 warner bros agreed to cofinance ai and cover distribution duties7 the film labored in development hell and aldiss was fired by kubrick over creative differences in 19898 bob shaw briefly served as writer leaving after six weeks due to kubricks demanding work schedule and ian watson was hired as the new writer in march 1990 aldiss later remarked not only did the bastard fire me he hired my enemy watson instead kubrick handed watson the adventures of pinocchio for inspiration calling ai a picaresque robot version of pinocchio79three weeks later watson gave kubrick his first story treatment and concluded his work on ai in may 1991 with another treatment of 90 pages gigolo joe was originally conceived as a gi mecha but watson suggested changing him to a male sex worker kubrick joked i guess we lost the kiddie market7 meanwhile kubrick dropped ai to work on a film adaptation of wartime lies feeling computer animation was not advanced enough to create the david character however after the release of spielbergs jurassic park with its innovative computergenerated imagery it was announced in november 1993 that production of ai would begin in 199410 dennis muren and ned gorman who worked on jurassic park became visual effects supervisors8 but kubrick was displeased with their previsualization and with the expense of hiring industrial light magic11– producer jan harlan on spielbergs first meeting with kubrick about ai12in early 1994 the film was in preproduction with christopher fangorn baker as concept artist and sara maitland assisting on the story which gave it a feminist fairytale focus7 maitland said that kubrick never referred to the film as ai but as pinocchio11 chris cunningham became the new visual effects supervisor some of his unproduced work for ai can be seen on the dvd the work of director chris cunningham13 aside from considering computer animation kubrick also had joseph mazzello do a screen test for the lead role11 cunningham helped assemble a series of little robottype humans for the david character we tried to construct a little boy with a movable rubber face to see whether we could make it look appealing producer jan harlan reflected but it was a total failure it looked awful hans moravec was brought in as a technical consultant11 meanwhile kubrick and harlan thought ai would be closer to steven spielbergs sensibilities as director1415 kubrick handed the position to spielberg in 1995 but spielberg chose to direct other projects and convinced kubrick to remain as director1216 the film was put on hold due to kubricks commitment to eyes wide shut 199917 after the filmmakers death in march 1999 harlan and christiane kubrick approached spielberg to take over the directors position1819 by november 1999 spielberg was writing the screenplay based on watsons 90page story treatment it was his first solo screenplay credit since close encounters of the third kind 197720 spielberg remained close to watsons treatment but removed various sex scenes with gigolo joe preproduction was briefly halted during february 2000 because spielberg pondered directing other projects which were harry potter and the philosophers stone minority report and memoirs of a geisha1721 the following month spielberg announced that ai would be his next project with minority report as a followup22 when he decided to fast track ai spielberg brought chris baker back as concept artist16the original start date was july 10 200015 but filming was delayed until august23 aside from a couple of weeks shooting on location in oxbow regional park in oregon ai was shot entirely using sound stages at warner bros studios and the spruce goose dome in long beach california24 the swinton house was constructed on stage 16 while stage 20 was used for rouge city and other sets2526 spielberg copied kubricks obsessively secretive approach to filmmaking by refusing to give the complete script to cast and crew banning press from the set and making actors sign confidentiality agreements social robotics expert cynthia breazeal served as technical consultant during production1527 haley joel osment and jude law applied prosthetic makeup daily in an attempt to look shinier and robotic4 costume designer bob ringwood studied pedestrians on the las vegas strip for his influence on the rouge city extras28 spielberg found postproduction on ai difficult because he was simultaneously preparing to shoot minority report29the films soundtrack was released by warner sunset records in 2001 the original score was composed and conducted by john williams and featured singers lara fabian on two songs and josh groban on one the films score also had a limited release as an official for your consideration academy promo as well as a complete score issue by lala land records in 201530 the band ministry appears in the film playing the song what about us but the song does not appear on the official soundtrack albumwarner bros used an alternate reality game titled the beast to promote the film over forty websites were created by atomic pictures in new york city kept online at cloudmakersorg including the website for cybertronics corp there were to be a series of video games for the xbox video game console that followed the storyline of the beast but they went undeveloped to avoid audiences mistaking ai for a family film no action figures were created although hasbro released a talking teddy following the films release in june 200115ai had its premiere at the venice film festival in 200131ai artificial intelligence was released on vhs and dvd in the us by dreamworks home entertainment on march 5 200232 in widescreen and fullscreen 2disc special editions featuring an eightpart documentary detailing the films development production music and visual effects the bonus features also included interviews with haley joel osment jude law frances oconnor steven spielberg and john williams two teaser trailers for the films original theatrical release and an extensive photo gallery featuring production sills and stanley kubricks original storyboards33 it was released overseas by warner home videothe film was first released on bluray disc in japan by warner home video on december 22 2010 followed shortly after with a us release by paramount home media distribution current owners of the dreamworks catalog on april 5 2011 this bluray

on june 29 2001 earning 29352630 during its opening weekend ai went on to gross 7862 million in us totals as well as 15731 million in foreign countries coming to a worldwide total of 23593 million35based on 192 reviews collected by rotten tomatoes 73 of critics gave the film positive notices with a score of 6610 the websites critical consensus reads a curious not always seamless amalgamation of kubricks chilly bleakness and spielbergs warmhearted optimism ai is in a word fascinating36 by comparison metacritic collected an average score of 65 based on 32 reviews which is considered favorable37producer jan harlan stated that kubrick would have applauded the final film while kubricks widow christiane also enjoyed ai38 brian aldiss admired the film as well i thought what an inventive intriguing ingenious involving film this was there are flaws in it and i suppose i might have a personal quibble but its so long since i wrote it of the films ending he wondered how it might have been had kubrick directed the film that is one of the ifs of film history—at least the ending indicates spielberg adding some sugar to kubricks wine the actual ending is overly sympathetic and moreover rather overtly engineered by a plot device that does not really bear credence but its a brilliant piece of film and of course its a phenomenon because it contains the energies and talents of two brilliant filmmakers39 richard corliss heavily praised spielbergs direction as well as the cast and visual effects40 roger ebert gave the film three stars saying that it was wonderful and maddening41 leonard maltin on the other hand gives the film two stars out of four in his movie guide writing the intriguing story draws us in thanks in part to osments exceptional performance but takes several wrong turns ultimately it just doesnt work spielberg rewrote the adaptation stanley kubrick commissioned of the brian aldiss short story super toys last all summer long the result is a curious and uncomfortable hybrid of kubrick and spielberg sensibilities however he calls john williams music score striking jonathan rosenbaum compared ai to solaris 1972 and praised both kubrick for proposing that spielberg direct the project and spielberg for doing his utmost to respect kubricks intentions while making it a profoundly personal work42 film critic armond white of the new york press praised the film noting that each part of davids journey through carnal and sexual universes into the final eschatological devastation becomes as profoundly philosophical and contemplative as anything by cinemas most thoughtful speculative artists – borzage ozu demy tarkovsky43 filmmaker billy wilder hailed ai as the most underrated film of the past few years44 when british filmmaker ken russell saw the film he wept during the ending45mick lasalle gave a largely negative review ai exhibits all its creators bad traits and none of the good so we end up with the structureless meandering slowmotion endlessness of kubrick combined with the fuzzy cuddly mindlessness of spielberg dubbing it spielbergs first boring movie lasalle also believed the robots at the end of the film were aliens and compared gigolo joe to the useless jar jar binks yet praised robin williams for his portrayal of a futuristic albert einstein46not in citation given peter travers gave a mixed review concluding spielberg cannot live up to kubricks darker side of the future but he still put the film on his top ten list that year for best movies47 david denby in the new yorker criticized ai for not adhering closely to his concept of the pinocchio character spielberg responded to some of the criticisms of the film stating that many of the so called sentimental elements of ai including the ending were in fact kubricks and the darker elements were his own48 however sara maitland who worked on the project with kubrick in the 1990s claimed that one of the reasons kubrick never started production on ai was because he had a hard time making the ending work49 james berardinelli found the film consistently involving with moments of nearbrilliance but far from a masterpiece in fact as the longawaited collaboration of kubrick and spielberg it ranks as something of a disappointment of the films highly debated finale he claimed there is no doubt that the concluding 30 minutes are all spielberg the outstanding question is where kubricks vision left off and spielbergs began50screenwriter ian watson has speculated worldwide ai was very successful and the 4thhighest earner of the year but it didnt do quite so well in america because the film so im told was too poetical and intellectual in general for american tastes plus quite a few critics in america misunderstood the film thinking for instance that the giacomettistyle beings in the final 20 minutes were aliens whereas they were robots of the future who had evolved themselves from the robots in the earlier part of the film and also thinking that the final 20 minutes were a sentimental addition by spielberg whereas those scenes were exactly what i wrote for stanley and exactly what he wanted filmed faithfully by spielberg51 despite mr watsons reference to worldwide box office of 4th the movie actually finished 16th worldwide among 2001 movie releases52in 2002 spielberg told film critic joe leydon that people pretend to think they know stanley kubrick and think they know me when most of them dont know either of us and whats really funny about that is all the parts of ai that people assume were stanleys were mine and all the parts of ai that people accuse me of sweetening and softening and sentimentalizing were all stanleys the teddy bear was stanleys the whole last 20 minutes of the movie was completely stanleys the whole first 35 40 minutes of the film—all the stuff in the house—was word for word from stanleys screenplay this was stanleys vision eighty percent of the critics got it all mixed up but i could see why because obviously ive done a lot of movies where people have cried and have been sentimental and ive been accused of sentimentalizing hardcore material but in fact it was stanley who did the sweetest parts of ai not me im the guy who did the dark center of the movie with the flesh fair and everything else thats why he wanted me to make the movie in the first place he said this is much closer to your sensibilities than my own53 he also added while there was divisiveness when ai came out i felt that i had achieved stanley’s wishes or goals54upon rewatching the film many years after its release bbc film critic mark kermode apologized to spielberg in an interview in january 2013 for getting it wrong on the film when he first viewed it in 2001 he now believes the film to be spielbergs enduring masterpiece55visual effects supervisors dennis muren stan winston michael lantieri and scott farrar were nominated for the academy award for best visual effects while john williams was nominated for best original music score56 steven spielberg jude law and williams received nominations at the 59th golden globe awards57 ai was successful at the saturn awards winning five awards including best science fiction film along with best writing for spielberg and best performance by a younger actor for osment58see also logic machines in fiction and list of fictional computers', 'ul':

nets complexity theory and more to a summer workshop called the dartmouth summer research project on artificial intelligence to discuss what would ultimately become the field of ai at that time the researchers came together to clarify and develop the concepts around “thinking machines” which up to this point had been quite divergent mccarthy is said to have picked the name artificial intelligence for its neutrality to avoid highlighting one of the tracks being pursued at the time for the field of “thinking machines” that included cybernetics automata theory and complex information processing the proposal for the conference said “the study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it”today modern dictionary definitions focus on ai being a subfield of computer science and how machines can imitate human intelligence being humanlike rather than becoming human the english oxford living dictionary gives this definition “the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence such as visual perception speech recognition decisionmaking and translation between languages”merriamwebster defines artificial intelligence this waythe encyclopedia britannica states “artificial intelligence ai the ability of a digital computer or computercontrolled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings” intelligent beings are those that can adapt to changing circumstancesdefinitions of artificial intelligence begin to shift based upon the goals that are trying to be achieved with an ai system generally people invest in ai development for one of these three objectivesturns out that the bulk of the ai development happening today by industry leaders falls under the third objective and uses human reasoning as a guide to provide better services or create better products rather trying to achieve a perfect replica of the human mindamazon builds a lot of its business on machinelearning systems as a subset of ai and defines ai as “the field of computer science dedicated to solving cognitive problems commonly associated with human intelligence such as learning problem solving and pattern recognition” machine learning is so important to amazon they stated “without ml amazoncom couldn’t grow its business improve its customer experience and selection and optimize its logistic speed and quality”while some of the major tech companies haven’t published a dictionarytype definition for ai we can extrapolate how they define the importance of ai by reviewing their research areasmachine and deep learning are the priority for google ai and its tools to “create smarter more useful technology and help as many people as possible” from translations to healthcare to making our smartphones even smarter facebook ai research is committed to “advancing the file of machine intelligence and are creating new technologies to give people better ways to communicate” ibm’s three areas of focus include ai engineering building scalable ai models and tools ai tech where the core capabilities of ai such as natural language processing speech and image recognition and reasoning are explored and ai science where expanding the frontiers of ai is the focusin 2016 several industry leaders including amazon apple deepmind google ibm and microsoft joined together to create partnership on ai to benefit people and society to develop and share best practices advance public understanding provide an open platform for discussion and to identify aspirational effort in ai for socially beneficial purposesthose working with ai today make it a priority to define the field for the problems it will solve and the benefits the technology can have for society it’s no longer a primary objective for most to get to ai that operates just like a human brain but to use its unique capabilities to enhance our worldnever miss any of bernard marrs postssimply join here for a weekly update from bernardhis new book is artificial intelligence in practice how 50

1200 lightyears from earth in the constellation aquariusa team of astronomers led by an undergraduate student in texas has discovered two planets orbiting stars more than 1200 lightyears from earthastronomers already knew of about 4000 exoplanets so finding two more might not seem like huge news but its who found them and how thats getting attentionanne dattilo a senior at the university of texas austin found the planets by using an artificial intelligence program to sift through a mountain of data collected by nasas kepler space telescope by using ai the 22yearold is helping to usher in a new era in astronomical researchdattilo got involved in the project about a year and a half ago after astronomer andrew vanderburg gave a talk during one of her classes vanderburg uses data from kepler to hunt for planets orbiting distant starsand at the very end he said im taking undergrads if any of you want to do research on this subject finding planets dattilo recalls i decided thats what i wanted to do so i emailed himkepler which launched in 2009 was designed to point at a small patch of sky and measure the light from some 100000 stars in its field of view if there is a planet orbiting one of the stars the light coming from that star will dim slightly when the planet passes in front of itthis illustration made available by nasa shows the kepler space telescope the planethunting spacecraft that launched in 2009 nasa via ap hide captionthis illustration made available by nasa shows the kepler space telescope the planethunting spacecraft that launched in 2009toward the end of keplers life mechanical failures meant it couldnt measure the light quite as accurately so the data it collected were harder to interpretdattilo modified an artificial intelligence program called astronetk2 to work on data from the latter part of the kepler mission once the modified program found stars that appeared to have planets dattilo and her colleagues used groundbased telescopes to confirm the findingsthe newly discovered planets officially named k2293b and k2294b orbit stars in the constellation aquarius and are both slightly larger than earthif we want to know how many planets there are in total we have to know how many planets weve found vanderburg said in a statement from the university of texas mcdonald observatory but we also have to know how many planets we missed thats where this ai comes invanderburg and google engineer chris shallue first used ai to uncover a planet around a kepler star in 2017 according to the statementjessie christiansen a research scientist with nasas exoplanet science institute at the california institute of technology says shes impressed by what dattilos team accomplished and in a way shes not all that surprisednasa makes all of the data publicly available christiansen says you just have to think of a new idea of what to do with the data that no one has done beforemichelle ntampaka of the harvardsmithsonian center for astrophysics expects to see lots more astronomers using artificial intelligence techniques to analyze their data in the future thats because newer telescopes dont so much collect images of stars and galaxies as digital data about these celestial objectswere just going to see unprecedented data volumes and were going to have to come up with new ways to deal with that

machines havent taken over not yet at least however they are seeping their way into our lives affecting how we live work and entertain ourselves from voicepowered personal assistants like siri and alexa to more underlying and fundamental technologies such as behavioral algorithms suggestive searches and autonomouslypowered selfdriving vehicles boasting powerful predictive capabilities there are several examples and applications of artificial intellgience in use todayhowever the technology is still in its infancy what many companies are calling ai today arent necessarily so as a software engineer i can claim that any piece of software has ai due to an algorithm that responds based on predefined multifaceted input or user behavior that isnt necessarily aia true artificiallyintelligent system is one that can learn on its own were talking about neural networks from the likes of googles deepmind which can make connections and reach meanings without relying on predefined behavioral algorithms true ai can improve on past iterations getting smarter and more aware allowing it to enhance its capabilities and its knowledgethat type of ai the kind that we see in wonderful stories depicted on television through the likes of hbos powerful and moving series westworld or alex garlands ex machina are still way off were not talking about that at least not yet today were talking about the pseudoai technologies that are driving much of our voice and nonvoice based interactions with the machines the machinelearning phase of the digital agewhile companies like apple facebook and tesla rollout groundbreaking updates and revolutionary changes to how we interact with machinelearning technology many of us are still clueless on just how ai is being used today by businesses both big and small how much of an effect will this technology have on our future lives and what other ways will it seep into daytoday life when ai really blossoms how much of an improvement will it have on the current iterations of this socalled technologyai and quantum computingthe truth is that whether or not true ai is out there or is actually a threat to our existence theres no stopping its evolution and its rise humans have always fixated themselves on improving life across every spectrum and the use of technology has become the vehicle for doing just that and although the past 100 years have seen the most dramatic technological upheavals to life than in all of human history the next 100 years is set to pave the way for a multigenerational leap forwardthis will be at the hands of artificial intelligence ai will also become smarter faster more fluid and humanlike thanks to the inevitable rise of quantum computing quantum computers will not only solve all of lifes most complex problems and mysteries regarding the environment aging disease war poverty famine the origins of the universe and deepspace exploration just to name a few itll soon power all of our ai systems acting as the brains of these superhuman machineshowever quantum computers hold their own inherent risks what happens after the first quantum computer goes online making the rest of the worlds computing obsolete how will existing architecture be protected from the threat that these quantum computers pose considering that the world lacks any formidable quantum resistant cryptography qrc how will a country like the united states or russia protect its assets from rogue nations or bad actors that are hellbent on using quantum computers to hack the worlds most secretive and lucrative informationin a conversation with nigel smart founder of dyadic security and vice president of the international association of cryptologic research a professor of cryptology at the university of bristol and an erc advanced grant holder he tells me that quantum computers could still be about 5 years out however when the first quantum computer is built smart tells me thatall of the worlds digital security is essentially broken the internet will not be secure as we rely on algorithms which are broken by quantum computers to secure our connections to web sites download emails and everything else even updates to phones and downloading applications from app stores will be broken and unreliable banking transactions via chipandpin could also be rendered insecure depending on exactly how the system is implemented in each countryclearly theres no stopping a quantum computer led by a determined party without a solid qrc while all of it is still what seems like a far way off the future of this technology presents a catch22 able to solve the worlds problems and likely to power all the ai systems on earth but also incredibly dangerous in the wrong handsapplications of artificial intelligence in use todaybeyond our quantumcomputing conundrum todays socalled ai systems are merely advanced machine learning software with extensive behavioral algorithms that adapt themselves to our likes and dislikes while extremely useful these machines arent getting smarter in the existential sense but they are improving their skills and usefulness based on a large dataset these are some of the most popular examples of artificial intelligence thats being used today1 sirieveryone is familiar with apples personal assistant siri shes the friendly voiceactivated computer that we interact with on a daily basis she helps us find information gives us directions add events to our calendars helps us send messages and so on siri is a pseudointelligent digital personal assistant she uses machinelearning technology to get smarter and better able to predict and understand our naturallanguage questions and requests2 alexaalexas rise to become the smart homes hub has been somewhat meteoric when amazon first introduced alexa it took much of the world by storm however its usefulness and its uncanny ability to decipher speech from anywhere in the room has made it a revolutionary product that can help us scour the web for information shop schedule appointments set alarms and a million other things but also help power our smart homes and be a conduit for those that might have limited mobility3 teslaif you dont own a tesla you have no idea what youre missing this is quite possibly one of the best cars ever made not only for the fact that its received so many accolades but because of its predictive capabilities selfdriving features and sheer technological coolness anyone thats into technology and cars needs to own a tesla and these vehicles are only getting smarter and smarter thanks to their overtheair updates4 cogitooriginally cofounded by ceo joshua feast and dr sandy pentland cogito is quite possibly one of the most powerful examples of behavioral adaptation to improve the emotional intelligence of customer support representatives that exists on the market today the company is a fusion of machine learning and behavioral science to improve the customer interaction for phone professionals this applies to millions upon millions of voice calls that are occurring on a daily basis5 boxeverboxever cofounded by ceo dave o’flanagan is a company that leans heavily on machine learning to improve the customers experience in the travel industry and deliver micromoments or experiences that delight the customers along the way its through machine learning and the usage of ai that the company has dominated the playing field helping its customers to find new ways to engage their clients in their travel journeys6 john pauljohn paul a highlyesteemed luxury travel concierge company helmed by its astute founder david amsellem is another powerful example of potent ai in the predictive algorithms for existingclient interactions able to understand and know their desires and needs on an acute level the company powers the concierge services for millions of customers through the worlds largest companies such as visa orange and air france and was recently acquired by accor hotels7 amazoncomamazons transactional ai is something thats been in existence for quite some time allowing it to make astronomical amounts of money online with its algorithms refined more and more with each passing year the company has gotten acutely smart at predicting just what were interested in purchasing based on our online behavior while amazon plans to ship products to us before we even know we need them it hasnt quite gotten there yet but its most certainly on its horizons8 netflixnetflix provides highly accurate predictive technology based on customers reactions to films it analyzes billions of records to suggest films that you might like based on your previous reactions and choices of films this tech is getting smarter and smarter by the year as the dataset grows however the techs only drawback is that most smalllabeled movies go unnoticed while bignamed movies grow and balloon on the platform9 pandorapandoras ai is quite possibly one of the most revolutionary techs that exists out there today they call it their musical dna based on 400 musical characteristics each song is first manually analyzed by a team of professional musicians based on this criteria and the system has an incredible track record for recommending songs that would otherwise go unnoticed but that people inherently love10 nestmost everyone is familiar with nest the learning thermostat that was acquired by google in january of 2014 for 32 billion the nest learning thermostat which by the way can now be voicecontrolled by alexa uses behavioral algorithms to predictively learn from your heating and cooling needs thus anticipating and adjusting the temperature in your home or office based on your own personal needs and also now

positively changing the way companies all over the world do businesswith that in mind we asked three top motley fool contributors to each discuss an artificial intelligence stock you should be watching closely this month read on to see why they chose facebook nasdaqfb visa nysev and alphabet nasdaqgoog nasdaqgooglimage source getty imagessteve symington facebook facebook is set to release firstquarter 2019 results next wednesday april 24 2019 and whats contained in the report will help set the tone for both the online advertising and broader tech industries shares of the social media juggernaut are already up 36 so far in 2018 albeit after plunging 26 last year as it traversed a difficult combination of dataprivacy scandals the spread of misinformation on its platforms and concerns over decelerating topline growth as facebook builds on a larger base with the help of ai facebook is striving to address those concernsthat said facebook management did offer some color on what to expect during the january conference call namely that firstquarter revenue growth should decelerate by a midsingledigitpercent range from 30 in q4 2018 to that end and though we dont usually pay close attention to wall streets demands most analysts see the company delivering earnings of 163 per share on a 251 increase in revenue to 1497 billionjust as important will be the trends underlying that growth last quarter the company saw daily and monthly active users each climb 9 to 152 billion and 232 billion respectively and roughly 27 billion people hopped on at least one of its platforms including facebook instagram whatsapp and messenger every month if facebook is seeing success with its recent efforts to combat last years problems and win back the trust of the public we should hope to see its number of users continue to steadily climbanders bylund visa paymentprocessing veteran visa may not be the first company that springs to mind in a discussion about artificial intelligence but maybe it should take this snippet from a management presentation at a recent industry conferencethe services that we offer that are extremely high valueadded and in many ways have economics that are very similar to our core business and very much leverage of core business or things like risks services fraud management and all that authentication services data analytics where we continue to add to our capabilities with ai said cfo vasant prabhu according to a transcript compiled by seeking alpha weve always been doing machine learning especially on fraudyep you can thank artificial intelligence for the fraud warnings that drop in whenever your card issuer finds suspicious activity in your credit card accounts visa and its peers have actually been on the bleeding edge of ai tools in practical use for many years these antifraud processes should continue improving over time as visa takes advantage of more advanced technologies ranging from neural networks to blockchain transactionsvisa is gearing up for a secondquarter earnings report next wednesday ai probably wont be a big talking point in that presentation but you can rest assured that visa takes advantage of the technology in a big way and will only continue to deepen its machine learning rootschris neiger alphabet alphabet makes the bulk of its revenue by selling ads across its various google services platforms but the company is also an artificial intelligence powerhouse and its making considerable investments in ai now so it can benefit latertake for example alphabets selfdriving vehicle company waymo the company has logged more than 10 million miles of autonomous driving and at the end of 2018 waymo launched one of the first commercial selfdriving car services in the country without ai waymos vehicles wouldnt be able to navigate traffic avoid pedestrians or learn from past driving experiences the company stands to benefit from this ai pursuit by licensing some of its tech to other companies and selling its own services all of which could help waymo generate nearly 100 billion in sales over the next decadeautonomous vehicles arent alphabets only ai bet though alphabet also owns deepmind an artificialintelligence tech company thats already proving itself invaluable just last month deepmind used some of its machine learning algorithms to predict when some of googles wind farms would produce the most wind thereby generating the most energy and scheduled some of the energy to be sent back to the electric grid why is this important because aipowered tools like this are poised to help add 157 trillion to the global economy by 2030 by creating new services and making existing ones more efficient imagine the same tech being used not just for googles wind farms but in power grids across the countrywith alphabet already knee deep in developing the ai tools and services that will make our lives more efficient investors should consider snatching up shares of this tech giant nowin todays fastchanging technology world we certainly cant guarantee that any given stock will go on to deliver outsized returns and beat the market in the process but with the help of ai it appears facebook visa and alphabet could be poised to do exactly that and we think at the very least investors would do well to add these stocks to their watch lists this monthas a technology and

rockwell anyohain the first half of the 20th century science fiction familiarized the world with the concept of artificially intelligent robots it began with the “heartless” tin man from the wizard of oz and continued with the humanoid robot that impersonated maria in metropolis by the 1950s we had a generation of scientists mathematicians and philosophers with the concept of artificial intelligence or ai culturally assimilated in their minds one such person was alan turing a young british polymath who explored the mathematical possibility of artificial intelligence turing suggested that humans use available information as well as reason in order to solve problems and make decisions so why can’t machines do the same thing this was the logical framework of his 1950 paper computing machinery and intelligence in which he discussed how to build intelligent machines and how to test their intelligenceunfortunately talk is cheap what stopped turing from getting to work right then and there first computers needed to fundamentally change before 1949 computers lacked a key prerequisite for intelligence they couldn’t store commands only execute them in other words computers could be told what to do but couldn’t remember what they did second computing was extremely expensive in the early 1950s the cost of leasing a computer ran up to 200000 a month only prestigious universities and big technology companies could afford to dillydally in these uncharted waters a proof of concept as well as advocacy from high profile people were needed to persuade funding sources that machine intelligence was worth pursuingfive years later the proof of concept was initialized through allen newell cliff shaw and herbert simon’s logic theorist the logic theorist was a program designed to mimic the problem solving skills of a human and was funded by research and development rand corporation it’s considered by many to be the first artificial intelligence program and was presented at the dartmouth summer research project on artificial intelligence dsrpai hosted by john mccarthy and marvin minsky in 1956 in this historic conference mccarthy imagining a great collaborative effort brought together top researchers from various fields for an open ended discussion on artificial intelligence the term which he coined at the very event sadly the conference fell short of mccarthy’s expectations people came and went as they pleased and there was failure to agree on standard methods for the field despite this everyone wholeheartedly aligned with the sentiment that ai was achievable the significance of this event cannot be undermined as it catalyzed the next twenty years of ai researchfrom 1957 to 1974 ai flourished computers could store more information and became faster cheaper and more accessible machine learning algorithms also improved and people got better at knowing which algorithm to apply to their problem early demonstrations such as newell and simon’s general problem solver and joseph weizenbaum’s eliza showed promise toward the goals of problem solving and the interpretation of spoken language respectively these successes as well as the advocacy of leading researchers namely the attendees of the dsrpai convinced government agencies such as the defense advanced research projects agency darpa to fund ai research at several institutions the government was particularly interested in a machine that could transcribe and translate spoken language as well as high throughput data processing optimism was high and expectations were even higher in 1970 marvin minsky told life magazine “from three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being” however while the basic proof of principle was there there was still a long way to go before the end goals of natural language processing abstract thinking and selfrecognition could be achievedbreaching the initial fog of ai revealed a mountain of obstacles the biggest was the lack of computational power to do anything substantial computers simply couldn’t store enough information or process it fast enough in order to communicate for example one needs to know the meanings of many words and understand them in many combinations hans moravec a doctoral student of mccarthy at the time stated that “computers were still millions of times too weak to exhibit intelligence” as patience dwindled so did the funding and research came to a slow roll for ten yearsin the 1980’s ai was reignited by two sources an expansion of the algorithmic toolkit and a boost of funds john hopfield and david rumelhart popularized “deep learning” techniques which allowed computers to learn using experience on the other hand edward feigenbaum introduced expert systems which mimicked the decision making process of a human expert the program would ask an expert in a field how to respond in a given situation and once this was learned for virtually every situation nonexperts could receive advice from that program expert systems were widely used in industries the japanese government heavily funded expert systems and other ai related endeavors as part of their fifth generation computer project fgcp from 19821990 they invested 400 million dollars with the goals of revolutionizing computer processing implementing logic programming and improving artificial intelligence unfortunately most of the ambitious goals were not met however it could be argued that the indirect effects of the fgcp inspired a talented young generation of engineers and scientists regardless funding of the fgcp ceased and ai fell out of the limelightironically in the absence of government funding and public hype ai thrived during the 1990s and 2000s many of the landmark goals of artificial intelligence had been achieved in 1997 reigning world chess champion and grand master gary kasparov was defeated by ibm’s deep blue a chess playing computer program this highly publicized match was the first time a reigning world chess champion loss to a computer and served as a huge step towards an artificially intelligent decision making program in the same year speech recognition software developed by dragon systems was implemented on windows this was another great step forward but in the direction of the spoken language interpretation endeavor it seemed that there wasn’t a problem machines couldn’t handle even human emotion was fair game as evidenced by kismet a robot developed by cynthia breazeal that could recognize and display emotionswe haven’t gotten any smarter about how we are coding artificial intelligence so what changed it turns out the fundamental limit of computer storage that was holding us back 30 years ago was no longer a problem which estimates that the memory and speed of computers doubles every year had finally caught up and in many cases surpassed our needs this is precisely how deep blue was able to defeat gary kasparov in 1997 and how google’s alpha go was able to defeat chinese go champion ke jie only a few months ago it offers a bit of an explanation to the roller coaster of ai research we saturate the capabilities of ai to the level of our current computational power computer storage and processing speed and then wait for moore’s law to catch up againwe now live in the age of “big data” an age in which we have the capacity to collect huge sums of information too cumbersome for a person to process the application of artificial intelligence in this regard has already been quite fruitful in several industries such as technology banking marketing and entertainment we’ve seen that even if algorithms don’t improve much big data and massive computing simply allow artificial intelligence to learn through brute force there may be evidence that moore’s law is slowing down a tad but the increase in data certainly hasn’t lost any momentum breakthroughs in computer science mathematics or neuroscience all serve as potential outs through the ceiling of moore’s lawso what is in store for the future in the immediate future ai language is looking like the next big thing in fact it’s already underway i can’t remember the last time i called a company and directly spoke with a human these days machines are even calling me one could imagine interacting with an expert system in a fluid conversation or having a conversation in two different languages being translated in real time we can also expect to see driverless cars on the road in the next twenty years and that is conservative in the long term the goal is general intelligence that is a machine that surpasses human cognitive abilities in all tasks this is along the lines of the sentient robot we are used to seeing in movies to me it seems inconceivable that this would be accomplished in the next 50 years even if the capability is there the ethical questions would serve as a strong barrier against fruition when that time comes but better even before the time comes we will need to have a serious conversation about machine policy and ethics ironically both fundamentally human subjects but for now we’ll allow ai to steadily improve and run amok in societyrockwell anyoha is a graduate student in the department of molecular biology with a background in physics and genetics his current project

hammond star advisor contributor computerworld ptuse commas to separate multiple email addressesyour message has been sentthere was an error emailing this pagewhat is artificial intelligence ai and what is the difference between general ai and narrow aithere seems to be a lot of disagreement and confusion around artificial intelligence right nowwe’re seeing ongoing discussion around evaluating ai systems with the turing test warnings that hyperintelligent machines are going to slaughter us and equally frightening if less dire warnings that ai and robots are going to take all of our jobsin parallel we have also seen the emergence of systems such as ibm watson google’s deep learning and conversational assistants such as apple’s siri google now and microsoft’s cortana mixed into all this has been crosstalk about whether building truly intelligent systems is even possiblea lot of noiseto get to the signal we need to understand the answer to a simple question what is aithe starting point is easy simply put artificial intelligence is a subfield of computer science its goal is to enable the development of computers that are able to do things normally done by people in particular things associated with people acting intelligentlystanford researcher john mccarthy coined the term in 1956 during what is now called the dartmouth conference where the core mission of the ai field was definedif we start with this definition any program can be considered ai if it does something that we would normally think of as intelligent in humans how the program does it is not the issue just that is able to do it at all that is it is ai if it is smart but it doesn’t have to be smart like usit turns out that people have very different goals with regard to building ai systems and they tend to fall into three camps based on how close the machines they are building line up with how people workfor some the goal is to build systems that think exactly the same way that people do others just want to get the job done and don’t care if the computation has anything to do with human thought and some are inbetween using human reasoning as a model that can inform and inspire but not as the final target for imitationthe work aimed at genuinely simulating human reasoning tends to be called “strong ai” in that any result can be used to not only build systems that think but also to explain how humans think as well however we have yet to see a real model of strong ai or systems that are actual simulations of human cognition as this is a very difficult problem to solve when that time comes the researchers involved will certainly pop some champagne toast the future and call it a daythe work in the second camp aimed at just getting systems to work is usually called “weak ai” in that while we might be able to build systems that can behave like humans the results will tell us nothing about how humans think one of the prime examples of this is ibm’s deep blue a system that was a master chess player but certainly did not play in the same way that humans dosomewhere in the middle of strong and weak ai is a third camp the “inbetween” systems that are informed or inspired by human reasoning this tends to be where most of the more powerful work is happening today these systems use human reasoning as a guide but they are not driven by the goal to perfectly model ita good example of this is ibm watson watson builds up evidence for the answers it finds by looking at thousands of pieces of text that give it a level of confidence in its conclusion it combines the ability to recognize patterns in text with the very different ability to weigh the evidence that matching those patterns provides its development was guided by the observation that people are able to come to conclusions without having hard and fast rules and can instead build up collections of evidence just like people watson is able to notice patterns in text that provide a little bit of evidence and then add all that evidence up to get to an answerlikewise google’s work in deep learning has a similar feel in that it is inspired by the actual structure of the brain informed by the behavior of neurons deep learning systems function by learning layers of representations for tasks such as image and speech recognition not exactly like the brain but inspired by itthe important takeaway here is that in order for a system to be considered ai it doesn’t have to work in the same way we do it just needs to be smartthere is another distinction to be made here the difference between ai systems designed for specific tasks often called “narrow ai” and those few systems that are designed for the ability to reason in general referred to as “general ai” people sometimes get confused by this distinction and consequently mistakenly interpret specific results in a specific area as somehow scoping across all of intelligent behaviorsystems that can recommend things to you based on your past behavior will be different from systems that can learn to recognize images from examples which will also be different from systems that can make decisions based on the syntheses of evidence they may all be examples of narrow ai in practice but may not be generalizable to address all of the issues that an intelligent machine will have to deal with on its own for example i may not want the system that is brilliant at figuring out where the nearest gas station is to also perform my medical diagnosticsthe next step is to look at how these ideas play out in the different capabilities we expect to see in intelligent systems and how they interact in the emerging ai ecosystem of today that is what they do and how can they play together so stay tuned – theres more to comethis article is published

artificial animals or at least artificial creatures that – in suitable contexts – appear to be animals and for many artificial persons or at least artificial creatures that – in suitable contexts – appear to be persons1 such goals immediately ensure that ai is a discipline of considerable interest to many philosophers and this has been confirmed eg by the energetic attempt on the part of numerous philosophers to show that these goals are in fact unattainable on the constructive side many of the core formalisms and techniques used in ai come out of and are indeed still much used and refined in philosophy firstorder logic and its extensions intensional logics suitable for the modeling of doxastic attitudes and deontic reasoning inductive logic probability theory and probabilistic reasoning practical reasoning and planning and so on in light of this some philosophers conduct ai research and development as philosophyin the present entry the history of ai is briefly recounted proposed definitions of the field are discussed and an overview of the field is provided in addition both philosophical ai ai pursued as and out of philosophy and philosophy of ai are discussed via examples of both the entry ends with some de rigueur speculative commentary regarding the future of aithe field of artificial intelligence ai officially started in 1956 launched by a small but nowfamous darpasponsored summer conference at dartmouth college in hanover new hampshire the 50year celebration of this conference ai50 was held in july 2006 at dartmouth with five of the original participants making it back2 what happened at this historic conference figures in the final section of this entry ten thinkers attended including john mccarthy who was working at dartmouth in 1956 claude shannon marvin minsky arthur samuel trenchard moore apparently the lone notetaker at the original conference ray solomonoff oliver selfridge allen newell and herbert simon from where we stand now into the start of the new millennium the dartmouth conference is memorable for many reasons including this pair one the term ‘artificial intelligence’ was coined there and has long been firmly entrenched despite being disliked by some of the attendees eg moore two newell and simon revealed a program – logic theorist lt – agreed by the attendees and indeed by nearly all those who learned of and about it soon after the conference to be a remarkable achievement lt was capable of proving elementary theorems in the propositional calculus34though the term ‘artificial intelligence’ made its advent at the 1956 conference certainly the field of ai operationally defined defined ie as a field constituted by practitioners who think and act in certain ways was in operation before 1956 for example in a famous mind paper of 1950 alan turing argues that the question “can a machine think” and here turing is talking about standard computing machines machines capable of computing functions from the natural numbers or pairs triples … thereof to the natural numbers that a turing machine or equivalent can handle should be replaced with the question “can a machine be linguistically indistinguishable from a human” specifically he proposes a test the “turing test” tt as it’s now known in the tt a woman and a computer are sequestered in sealed rooms and a human judge in the dark as to which of the two rooms contains which contestant asks questions by email actually by teletype to use the original term of the two if on the strength of returned answers the judge can do no better than 5050 when delivering a verdict as to which room houses which player we say that the computer in question has passed the tt passing in this sense operationalizes linguistic indistinguishability later we shall discuss the role that tt has played and indeed continues to play in attempts to define ai at the moment though the point is that in his paper turing explicitly lays down the call for building machines that would provide an existence proof of an affirmative answer to his question the call even includes a suggestion for how such construction should proceed he suggests that “child machines” be built and that these machines could then gradually grow up on their own to learn to communicate in natural language at the level of adult humans this suggestion has arguably been followed by rodney brooks and the philosopher daniel dennett 1994 in the cog project in addition the spielbergkubrick movie ai is at least in part a cinematic exploration of turing’s suggestion5 the tt continues to be at the heart of ai and discussions of its foundations as confirmed by the appearance of moor 2003 in fact the tt continues to be used to define the field as in nilsson’s 1998 position expressed in his textbook for the field that ai simply is the field devoted to building an artifact able to negotiate this test energy supplied by the dream of engineering a computer that can pass tt or by controversy surrounding claims that it has already been passed is if anything stronger than ever and the reader has only to do an internet search via the stringturing test passedto find uptotheminute attempts at reaching this dream and attempts sometimes made by philosophers to debunk claims that some such attempt has succeededreturning to the issue of the historical record even if one bolsters the claim that ai started at the 1956 conference by adding the proviso that ‘artificial intelligence’ refers to a nutsandbolts engineering pursuit in which case turing’s philosophical discussion despite calls for a child machine wouldn’t exactly count as ai per se one must confront the fact that turing and indeed many predecessors did attempt to build intelligent artifacts in turing’s case such building was surprisingly wellunderstood before the advent of programmable computers turing wrote a program for playing chess before there were computers to run such programs on by slavishly following the code himself he did this well before 1950 and long before newell 1973 gave thought in print to the possibility of a sustained serious attempt at building a good chessplaying computer6from the perspective of philosophy which views the systematic investigation of mechanical intelligence as meaningful and productive separate from the specific logicist formalisms eg firstorder logic and problems eg the entscheidungsproblem that gave birth to computer science neither the 1956 conference nor turing’s mind paper come close to marking the start of ai this is easy enough to see for example descartes proposed tt not the tt by name of course long before turing was born7 here’s the relevant passageat the moment descartes is certainly carrying the day8 turing predicted that his test would be passed by 2000 but the fireworks across the globe at the start of the new millennium have long since died down and the most articulate of computers still can’t meaningfully debate a sharp toddler moreover while in certain focussed areas machines outperform minds ibm’s famous deep blue prevailed in chess over gary kasparov eg and more recently ai systems have prevailed in other games eg jeopardy and go about which more will momentarily be said minds have a cartesian capacity for cultivating their expertise in virtually any sphere if it were announced to deep blue or any current successor that chess was no longer to be the game of choice but rather a heretofore unplayed variant of chess the machine would be trounced by human children of average intelligence having no chess expertise ai simply hasn’t managed to create general intelligence it hasn’t even managed to produce an artifact indicating that eventually it will create such a thingbut what about ibm watson’s famous nailbiting victory in the jeopardy gameshow contest9 that certainly seems to be a machine triumph over humans on their “home field” since jeopardy delivers a humanlevel linguistic challenge ranging across many domains indeed among many ai cognoscenti watson’s success is considered to be much more impressive than deep blue’s for numerous reasons one reason is that while chess is generally considered to be wellunderstood from the formalcomputational perspective after all it’s wellknown that there exists a perfect strategy for playing chess in opendomain questionanswering qa as in any significant naturallanguage processing task there is no consensus as to what problem formally speaking one is trying to solve briefly questionanswering qa is what the reader would think it is one asks a question of a machine and gets an answer where the answer has to be produced via some “significant” computational process see strzalkowski harabagiu 2006 for an overview of what qa historically has been as a field a bit more precisely there is no agreement as to what underlying function formally speaking questionanswering capability computes this lack of agreement stems quite naturally from the fact that there is of course no consensus as to what natural languages are formally speaking10 despite this murkiness and in the face of an almost universal belief that opendomain questionanswering would remain unsolved for a decade or more watson decisively beat the two top human jeopardy champions on the planet during the contest watson had to answer questions that required not only command of simple factoids question1 but also of some amount of rudimentary reasoning in the form of temporal reasoning and commonsense question2question1 the only two consecutive us presidents with the same first namequestion2 in may 1898 portugal celebrated the 400th anniversary of this explorer’s arrival in indiawhile watson is demonstrably better than humans in jeopardystyle quizzing a new human jeopardy master could arrive on the scene but as for chess ai now assumes that a second round of ibmlevel investment would vanquish the new human opponent this approach does not work for the kind of nlp challenge that descartes described that is watson can’t converse on the fly after all some questions don’t hinge on sophisticated information retrieval and machine learning over preexisting data but rather on intricate reasoning right on the spot such questions may for instance involve anaphora resolution which require even deeper degrees of commonsensical understanding of time space history folk psychology and so on levesque 2013 has catalogued some alarmingly simple questions which fall in this category marcus 2013 gives an account of levesque’s challenges that is accessible to a wider audience the other class of questionanswering tasks on which watson fails can be characterized as dynamic questionanswering these are questions for which answers may not be recorded in textual form anywhere at the time of questioning or for which answers are dependent on factors that change with time two questions that fall in this category are given below govindarajulu et al 2013question3 if i have 4 foos and 5 bars and if foos are not the same as bars how many foos will i have if i get 3 bazes which just happen to be foosquestion4 what was ibm’s sharpe ratio in the last 60 days of tradingclosely following watson’s victory in march 2016 google deepmind’s alphago defeated one of go’s topranked players lee seedol in four out of five matches this was considered a landmark achievement within ai as it was widely believed in the ai community that computer victory in go was at least a few decades away partly due to the enormous number of valid sequences of moves in go compared to that in chess11 while this is a remarkable achievement it should be noted that despite breathless coverage in the popular press12 alphago while indisputably a great go player is just that for example neither alphago nor watson can understand the rules of go written in plainandsimple english and produce a computer program that can play the game it’s interesting that there is one endeavor in ai that tackles a narrow version of this very problem in general game playing a machine is given a description of a brand new game just before it has to play the game genesereth et al 2005 however the description in question is expressed in a formal language and the machine has to manage to play the game from this description note that this is still far from understanding even a simple description of a game in english well enough to play itbut what if we consider the history of ai not from the perspective of philosophy but rather from the perspective of the field with which today it is most closely connected the reference here is to computer science from this perspective does ai run back to well before turing interestingly enough the results are the same we find that ai runs deep into the past and has always had philosophy in its veins this is true for the simple reason that computer science grew out of logic and probability theory13 which in turn grew out of and is still intertwined with philosophy computer science today is shot through and through with logic the two fields cannot be separated this phenomenon has become an object of study unto itself halpern et al 2001 the situation is no different when we are talking not about traditional logic but rather about probabilistic formalisms also a significant component of modernday ai these formalisms also grew out of philosophy as nicely chronicled in part by glymour 1992 for example in the one mind of pascal was born a method of rigorously calculating probabilities conditional probability which plays a particularly large role in ai currently and such fertile philosophicoprobabilistic arguments as pascal’s wager according to which it is irrational not to become a christianthat modernday ai has its roots in philosophy and in fact that these historical roots are temporally deeper than even descartes’ distant day can be seen by looking to the clever revealing cover of the second edition the third edition is the current one of the comprehensive textbook artificial intelligence a modern approach known in the ai community as simply aima2e for russell norvig 2002cover of aima2e russell norvig 2002what you see there is an eclectic collection of memorabilia that might be on and around the desk of some imaginary ai researcher for example if you look carefully you will specifically see a picture of turing a view of big ben through a window perhaps rn are aware of the fact that turing famously held at one point that a physical machine with the power of a universal turing machine is physically impossible he quipped that it would have to be the size of big ben a planning algorithm described in aristotle’s de motu animalium frege’s fascinating notation for firstorder logic a glimpse of lewis carroll’s 1958 pictorial representation of syllogistic reasoning ramon lull’s conceptgenerating wheel from his 13thcentury ars magna and a number of other pregnant items including in a clever recursive and borderingonselfcongratulatory touch a copy of aima itself though there is insufficient space here to make all the historical connections we can safely infer from the appearance of these items and here we of course refer to the ancient ones aristotle conceived of planning as informationprocessing over twoandahalf millennia back and in addition as glymour 1992 notes artistotle can also be credited with devising the first knowledgebases and ontologies two types of representation schemes that have long been central to ai that ai is indeed very very old even those who insist that ai is at least in part an artifactbuilding enterprise must concede that in light of these objects ai is ancient for it isn’t just theorizing from the perspective that intelligence is at bottom computational that runs back into the remote past of human history lull’s wheel for example marks an attempt to capture intelligence not only in computation but in a physical artifact that embodies that computation14aima has now reached its the third edition and those interested in the history of ai and for that matter the history of philosophy of mind will not be disappointed by examination of the cover of the third installment the cover of the second edition is almost exactly like the first edition all the elements of the cover separately listed and annotated can be found online one significant addition to the cover of the third edition is a drawing of thomas bayes his appearance reflects the recent rise in the popularity of probabilistic techniques in ai which we discuss laterone final point about the history of ai seems worth makingit is generally assumed that the birth of modernday ai in the 1950s came in large part because of and through the advent of the modern highspeed digital computer this assumption accords with commonsense after all ai and for that matter to some degree its cousin cognitive science particularly computational cognitive modeling the subfield of cognitive science devoted to producing computational simulations of human cognition is aimed at implementing intelligence in a computer and it stands to reason that such a goal would be inseparably linked with the advent of such devices however this is only part of the story the part that reaches back but to turing and others eg von neuman responsible for the first electronic computers the other part is that as already mentioned ai has a particularly strong tie historically speaking to reasoning logicbased and in the need to deal with uncertainty inductiveprobabilistic reasoning in this story nicely told by glymour 1992 a search for an answer to the question “what is a proof” eventually led to an answer based on frege’s version of firstorder logic fol a finitary mathematical proof consists in a series of stepbystep inferences from one formula of firstorder logic to the next the obvious extension of this answer and it isn’t a complete answer given that lots of classical mathematics despite conventional wisdom clearly can’t be expressed in fol even the peano axioms to be expressed as a finite set of formulae require sol is to say that not only mathematical thinking but thinking period can be expressed in fol this extension was entertained by many logicians long before the start of informationprocessing psychology and cognitive science – a fact some cognitive psychologists and cognitive scientists often seem to forget today logicbased ai is only part of ai but the point is that this part still lives with help from logics much more powerful but much more complicated than fol and it can be traced all the way back to aristotle’s theory of the syllogism15 in the case of uncertain reasoning the question isn’t “what is a proof” but rather questions such as “what is it rational to believe in light of certain observations and probabilities” this is a question posed and tackled long before the arrival of digital computersso far we have been proceeding as if we have a firm and precise grasp of the nature of ai but what exactly is ai philosophers arguably know better than anyone that precisely defining a particular discipline to the satisfaction of all relevant parties including those working in the discipline itself can be acutely challenging philosophers of science certainly have proposed credible accounts of what constitutes at least the general shape and texture of a given field of science andor engineering but what exactly is the agreedupon definition of physics what about biology what for that matter is philosophy exactly these are remarkably difficult maybe even eternally unanswerable questions especially if the target is a consensus definition perhaps the most prudent course we can manage here under obvious space constraints is to present in encapsulated form some proposed definitions of ai we do include a glimpse of recent attempts to define ai in detailed rigorous fashion and we suspect that such attempts will be of interest to philosophers of science and those interested in this subarea of philosophyrussell and norvig 1995 2002 2009 in their aforementioned aima text provide a set of possible answers to the “what is ai” question that has considerable currency in the field itself these answers all assume that ai should be defined in terms of its goals a candidate definition thus has the form “ai is the field that aims at building …” the answers all fall under a quartet of types placed along two dimensions one dimension is whether the goal is to match human performance or instead ideal rationality the other dimension is whether the goal is to build systems that reasonthink or rather systems that act the situation is summed up in this tablefour possible goals for ai according to aimaplease note that this quartet of possibilities does reflect at least a significant portion of the relevant literature for example philosopher john haugeland 1985 falls into the humanreasoning quadrant when he says that ai is “the exciting new effort to make computers think … machines with minds in the full and literal sense” by far this is the quadrant that most popular narratives affirm and explore the recent westworld tv series is a powerful case in point luger and stubblefield 1993 seem to fall into the idealact quadrant when they write “the branch of computer science that is concerned with the automation of intelligent behavior” the humanact position is occupied most prominently by turing whose test is passed only by those systems able to act sufficiently like a human the “thinking rationally” position is defended eg by winston 1992 while it might not be entirely uncontroversial to assert that the four bins given here are exhaustive such an assertion appears to be quite plausible even when the literature up to the present moment is canvassedit’s important to know that the contrast between the focus on systems that thinkreason versus systems that act while found as we have seen at the heart of the aima texts and at the heart of ai itself should not be interpreted as implying that ai researchers view their work as falling all and only within one of these two compartments researchers who focus more or less exclusively on knowledge representation and reasoning are also quite prepared to acknowledge that they are working on what they take to be a central component or capability within any one of a family of larger systems spanning the reasonact distinction the clearest case may come from the work on planning – an ai area traditionally making central use of representation and reasoning for good or ill much of this research is done in abstraction in vitro as opposed to in vivo but the researchers involved certainly intend or at least hope that the results of their work can be embedded into systems that actually do things such as for example execute the planswhat about russell and norvig themselves what is their answer to the what is ai question they are firmly in the the “acting rationally” camp in fact it’s safe to say both that they are the chief proponents of this answer and that they have been remarkably successful evangelists their extremely influential aima series can be viewed as a booklength defense and specification of the idealact category we will look a bit later at how russell and norvig lay out all of ai in terms of intelligent agents which are systems that act in accordance with various ideal standards for rationality but first let’s look a bit closer at the view of intelligence underlying the aima text we can do so by turning to russell 1997 here russell recasts the “what is ai” question as the question “what is intelligence” presumably under the assumption that we have a good grasp of what an artifact is and then he identifies intelligence with rationality more specifically russell sees ai as the field devoted to building intelligent agents which are functions taking as input tuples of percepts from the external environment and producing behavior actions on the basis of these percepts russell’s overall picture is this onethe basic picture underlying russell’s account of intelligencerationalitylet’s unpack this diagram a bit and take a look first at the account of perfect rationality that can be derived from it the behavior of the agent in the environment e from a class be of environments produces a sequence of states or snapshots of that environment a performance measure u evaluates this sequence notice the box labeled “performance measure” in the above figure we let vfbeu denote the expected utility according to u of the agent function f operating on be16 now we identify a perfectly rational agent with the agent functionaccording to the above equation a perfectly rational agent can be taken to be the function fopt which produces the maximum expected utility in the environment under consideration of course as russell points out it’s usually not possible to actually build perfectly rational agents for example though it’s easy enough to specify an algorithm for playing invincible chess it’s not feasible to implement this algorithm what traditionally happens in ai is that programs that are – to use russell’s apt terminology – calculatively rational are constructed instead these are programs that if executed infinitely fast would result in perfectly rational behavior in the case of chess this would mean that we strive to write a program that runs an algorithm capable in principle of finding a flawless move but we add features that truncate the search for this move in order to play within intervals of digestible durationrussell himself champions a new brand of intelligencerationality for ai he calls this brand bounded optimality to understand russell’s view first we follow him in introducing a distinction we say that agents have two components a program and a machine upon which the program runs we write agentp m to denote the agent function implemented by program p running on machine m now let mathcalpm denote the set of all programs p that can run on machine m the bounded optimal program poptm then isyou can understand this equation in terms of any of the mathematical idealizations for standard computation for example machines can be identified with turing machines minus instructions ie tms are here viewed architecturally only as having tapes divided into squares upon which symbols can be written readwrite heads capable of moving up and down the tape to write and erase and control units which are in one of a finite number of states at any time and programs can be identified with instructions in the turingmachine model telling the machine to write and erase symbols depending upon what state the machine is in so if you are told that you must “program” within the constraints of a 22state turing machine you could search for the “best” program given those constraints in other words you could strive to find the optimal program within the bounds of the 22state architecture russell’s 1997 view is thus that ai is the field devoted to creating optimal programs for intelligent agents under time and space constraints on the machines implementing these programs17the reader must have noticed that in the equation for poptm we have not elaborated on be and u and how equation eqrefeq1 might be used to construct an agent if the class of environments be is quite general or if the true environment e is simply unknown depending on the task for which one is constructing an artificial agent e and u would vary the mathematical form of the environment e and the utility function u would vary wildly from say chess to jeopardy of course if we were to design a globally intelligent agent and not just a chessplaying agent we could get away with having just one pair of e and u what would e look like if we were building a generally intelligent agent and not just an agent that is good at a single task e would be a model of not just a single game or a task but the entire physicalsocialvirtual universe consisting of many games tasks situations problems etc this project is at least currently hopelessly difficult as obviously we are nowhere near to having such a comprehensive theoryofeverything model for further discussion of a theoretical architecture put forward for this problem see the supplement on the aixi architectureit should be mentioned that there is a different much more straightforward answer to the “what is ai” question this answer which goes back to the days of the original dartmouth conference was expressed by among others newell 1973 one of the grandfathers of modernday ai recall that he attended the 1956 conference it isthe above definition can be seen as fully specifying a concrete version of russell and norvig’s four possible goals though few are aware of this now this answer was taken quite seriously for a while and in fact underlied one of the most famous programs in the history of ai the analogy program of evans 1968 which solved geometric analogy problems of a type seen in many intelligence tests an attempt to rigorously define this forgotten form of ai as what they dub psychometric ai and to resurrect it from the days of newell and evans is provided by bringsjord and schimanski 2003 see also eg bringsjord 2011 a sizable private investment has been made in the ongoing attempt now known as project aristo to build a “digital aristotle” in the form of a machine able to excel on standardized tests such at the ap exams tackled by us high school students friedland et al 2004 vibrant work in this direction continues today at the allen institute for artificial intelligence18 in addition researchers at northwestern have forged a connection between ai and tests of mechanical ability klenk et al 2005in the end as is the case with any discipline to really know precisely what that discipline is requires you to at least to some degree dive in and do or at least dive in and read two decades ago such a dive was quite manageable today because the content that has come to constitute ai has mushroomed the dive or at least the swim after it is a bit more demandingthere are a number of ways of “carving up” ai by far the most prudent and productive way to summarize the field is to turn yet again to the aima text given its comprehensive overview of the fieldas russell and norvig 2009 tell us in the preface of aimathe basic picture is thus summed up in this figureimpressionistic overview of an intelligent agentthe content of aima derives essentially from fleshing out this picture that is the above figure corresponds to the different ways of representing the overall function that intelligent agents implement and there is a progression from the least powerful agents up to the more powerful ones the following figure gives a highlevel view of a simple kind of agent discussed early in the book though simple this sort of agent corresponds to the architecture of representationfree agents designed and implemented by rodney brooks 1991a simple reflex agentas the book progresses agents get increasingly sophisticated and the implementation of the function they represent thus draws from more and more of what ai can currently muster the following figure gives an overview of an agent that is a bit smarter than the simple reflex agent this smarter agent has the ability to internally model the outside world and is therefore not simply at the mercy of what can at the moment be directly senseda more sophisticated reflex agentthere are seven parts to aima as the reader passes through these parts she is introduced to agents that take on the powers discussed in each part part i is an introduction to the agentbased view part ii is concerned with giving an intelligent agent the capacity to think ahead a few steps in clearly defined environments examples here include agents able to successfully play games of perfect information such as chess part iii deals with agents that have declarative knowledge and can reason in ways that will be quite familiar to most philosophers and logicians eg knowledgebased agents deduce what actions should be taken to secure their goals part iv of the book outfits agents with the power to handle uncertainty by reasoning in probabilistic fashion19 in part v agents are given a capacity to learn the following figure shows the overall structure of a learning agenta learning agentthe final set of powers agents are given allow them to communicate these powers are covered in part viphilosophers who patiently travel the entire progression of increasingly smart agents will no doubt ask when reaching the end of part vii if anything is missing are we given enough in general to build an artificial person or is there enough only to build a mere animal this question is implicit in the following from charniak and mcdermott 1985to their credit russell norvig in aima’s chapter 27 “ai present and future” consider this question at least to some degree they do so by considering some challenges to ai that have hitherto not been met one of these challenges is described by rn as followswhile there has seen some advances in addressing this challenge in the form of deep learning or representation learning this specific challenge is actually merely a foothill before a range of dizzyingly high mountains that ai must eventually somehow manage to climb one of those mountains put simply is reading21 despite the fact that as noted part v of aima is devoted to machine learning ai as it stands offers next to nothing in the way of a mechanization of learning by reading yet when you think about it reading is probably the dominant way you learn at this stage in your life consider what you’re doing at this very moment it’s a good bet that you are reading this sentence because earlier you set yourself the goal of learning about the field of ai yet the formal models of learning provided in aima’s part iv which are all and only the models at play in ai cannot be applied to learning by reading22 these models all start with a functionbased view of learning according to this view to learn is almost invariably to produce an underlying function ff on the basis of a restricted set of pairsfor example consider receiving inputs consisting of 1 2 3 4 and 5 and corresponding range values of 1 4 9 16 and 25 the goal is to “learn” the underlying mapping from natural numbers to natural numbers in this case assume that the underlying function is n2 and that you do “learn” it while this narrow model of learning can be productively applied to a number of processes the process of reading isn’t one of them learning by reading cannot at least for the foreseeable future be modeled as divining a function that produces argumentvalue pairs instead your reading about ai can pay dividends only if your knowledge has increased in the right way and if that knowledge leaves you poised to be able to produce behavior taken to confirm sufficient mastery of the subject area in question this behavior can range from correctly answering and justifying test questions regarding ai to producing a robust compelling presentation or paper that signals your achievementtwo points deserve to be made about machine reading first it may not be clear to all readers that reading is an ability that is central to intelligence the centrality derives from the fact that intelligence requires vast knowledge we have no other means of getting systematic knowledge into a system than to get it in from text whether text on the web text in libraries newspapers and so on you might even say that the big problem with ai has been that machines really don’t know much compared to humans that can only be because of the fact that humans read or hear illiterate people can listen to text being uttered and learn that way either machines gain knowledge by humans manually encoding and inserting knowledge or by reading and listening these are brute facts we leave aside supernatural techniques of course oddly enough turing didn’t he seemed to think esp should be discussed in connection with the powers of minds and machines see turing 195023now for the second point humans able to read have invariably also learned a language and learning languages has been modeled in conformity to the functionbased approach adumbrated just above osherson et al 1986 however this doesn’t entail that an artificial agent able to read at least to a significant degree must have really and truly learned a natural language ai is first and foremost concerned with engineering computational artifacts that measure up to some test where yes sometimes that test is from the human sphere not with whether these artifacts process information in ways that match those present in the human case it may or may not be necessary when engineering a machine that can read to imbue that machine with humanlevel linguistic competence the issue is empirical and as time unfolds and the engineering is pursued we shall no doubt see the issue settledtwo additional high mountains facing ai are subjective consciousness and creativity yet it would seem that these great challenges are ones the field apparently hasn’t even come to grips with mental phenomena of paramount importance to many philosophers of mind and neuroscience are simply missing from aima for example consciousness is only mentioned in passing in aima but subjective consciousness is the most important thing in our lives – indeed we only desire to go on living because we wish to go on enjoying subjective states of certain types moreover if human minds are the product of evolution then presumably phenomenal consciousness has great survival value and would be of tremendous help to a robot intended to have at least the behavioral repertoire of the first creatures with brains that match our own huntergatherers see pinker 1997 of course subjective consciousness is largely missing from the sister fields of cognitive psychology and computational cognitive modeling as well we discuss some of these challenges in the philosophy of artificial intelligence section below for a list of similar challenges to cognitive science see the relevant section of the entry on cognitive science24to some readers it might seem in the very least tendentious to point to subjective consciousness as a major challenge to ai that it has yet to address these readers might be of the view that pointing to this problem is to look at ai through a distinctively philosophical prism and indeed a controversial philosophical standpointbut as its literature makes clear ai measures itself by looking to animals and humans and picking out in them remarkable mental powers and by then seeing if these powers can be mechanized arguably the power most important to humans the capacity to experience is nowhere to be found on the target list of most ai researchers there may be a good reason for this no formalism is at hand perhaps but there is no denying the state of affairs in question obtains and that in light of how ai measures itself that it’s worrisomeas to creativity it’s quite remarkable that the power we most praise in human minds is nowhere to be found in aima just as in charniak mcdermott 1985 one cannot find ‘neural’ in the index ‘creativity’ can’t be found in the index of aima this is particularly odd because many ai researchers have in fact worked on creativity especially those coming out of philosophy eg boden 1994 bringsjord ferrucci 2000although the focus has been on aima any of its counterparts could have been used as an example consider artificial intelligence a new synthesis by nils nilsson as in the case of aima everything here revolves around a gradual progression from the simplest of agents in nilsson’s case reactive agents to ones having more and more of those powers that distinguish persons energetic readers can verify that there is a striking parallel between the main sections of nilsson’s book and aima in addition nilsson like russell and norvig ignores phenomenal consciousness reading and creativity none of the three are even mentioned likewise a recent comprehensive ai textbook by luger 2008 follows the same patterna final point to wrap up this section it seems quite plausible to hold that there is a certain inevitability to the structure of an ai textbook and the apparent reason is perhaps rather interesting in personal conversation jim hendler a wellknown ai researcher who is one of the main innovators behind semantic web bernerslee hendler lassila 2001 an underdevelopment “aiready” version of the world wide web has said that this inevitability can be rather easily displayed when teaching introduction to ai here’s how begin by asking students what they think ai is invariably many students will volunteer that ai is the field devoted to building artificial creatures that are intelligent next ask for examples of intelligent creatures students always respond by giving examples across a continuum simple multicellular organisms insects rodents lower mammals higher mammals culminating in the great apes and finally human persons when students are asked to describe the differences between the creatures they have cited they end up essentially describing the progression from simple agents to ones having our eg communicative powers this progression gives the skeleton of every comprehensive ai textbook why does this happen the answer seems clear it happens because we can’t resist conceiving of ai in terms of the powers of extant creatures with which we are familiar at least at present persons and the creatures who enjoy only bits and pieces of personhood are – to repeat – the measure of ai25reasoning based on classical deductive logic is monotonic that is if phivdashphi then for all psi phicup psivdashphi commonsense reasoning is not monotonic while you may currently believe on the basis of reasoning that your house is still standing if while at work you see on your computer screen that a vast tornado is moving through the location of your house you will drop this belief the addition of new information causes previous inferences to fail in the simpler example that has become an ai staple if i tell you that tweety is a bird you will infer that tweety can fly but if i then inform you that tweety is a penguin the inference evaporates as well it should nonmonotonic or defeasible logic includes formalisms designed to capture the mechanisms underlying these kinds of examples see the separate entry on logic and artificial intelligence which is focused on nonmonotonic reasoning and reasoning about time and change it also provides a history of the early days of logicbased ai making clear the contributions of those who founded the tradition eg john mccarthy and pat hayes see their seminal 1969 paperthe formalisms and techniques of logicbased ai have reached a level of impressive maturity – so much so that in various academic and corporate laboratories implementations of these formalisms and techniques can be used to engineer robust realworld software it is strongly recommend that readers who have an interest to learn where ai stands in these areas consult mueller 2006 which provides in one volume integrated coverage of nonmonotonic reasoning in the form specifically of circumscription and reasoning about time and change in the situation and event calculi the former calculus is also introduced by thomason in the second timepoints are included among other things the other nice thing about mueller 2006 is that the logic used is multisorted firstorder logic msl which has unificatory power that will be known to and appreciated by many technical philosophers and logicians manzano 1996we now turn to three further topics of importance in ai they arethis trio is covered in order beginning with the firstdetailed accounts of logicist ai that fall under the agentbased scheme can be found in nilsson 1991 bringsjord ferrucci 199826 the core idea is that an intelligent agent receives percepts from the external world in the form of formulae in some logical system eg firstorder logic and infers on the basis of these percepts and its knowledge base what actions should be performed to secure the agent’s goals this is of course a barbaric simplification information from the external world is encoded in formulae and transducers to accomplish this feat may be components of the agentto clarify things a bit we consider briefly the logicist view in connection with arbitrary logical systems mathcallx27 we obtain a particular logical system by setting x in the appropriate way some examples if xi then we have a system at the level of fol following the standard notation from model theory see eg ebbinghaus et al 1984 mathcallii is secondorder logic and mathcallomegaiomega is a “small system” of infinitary logic countably infinite conjunctions and disjunctions are permitted these logical systems are all extensional but there are intensional ones as well for example we can have logical systems corresponding to those seen in standard propositional modal logic chellas 1980 one possibility familiar to many philosophers would be propositional kt45 or mathcallkt4528 in each case the system in question includes a relevant alphabet from which wellformed formulae are constructed by way of a formal grammar a reasoning or proof theory a formal semantics and at least some metatheoretical results soundness completeness etc taking off from standard notation we can thus say that a set of formulas in some particular logical system mathcallx phimathcallx can be used in conjunction with some reasoning theory to infer some particular formula phimathcallx the reasoning may be deductive inductive abductive and so on logicist ai isn’t in the least restricted to any particular mode of reasoning to say that such a situation holds we write phimathcallx vdashmathcallx phimathcallxwhen the logical system referred to is clear from context or when we don’t care about which logical system is involved we can simply write phi vdash phieach logical system in its formal semantics will include objects designed to represent ways the world pointed to by formulae in this system can be let these ways be denoted by wimathcallx when we aren’t concerned with which logical system is involved we can simply write wi to say that such a way models a formula phi we write wi models phiwe extend this to a set of formulas in the natural way wimodelsphi means that all the elements of phi are true on wi now using the simple machinery we’ve established we can describe in broad strokes the life of an intelligent agent that conforms to the logicist point of view this life conforms to the basic cycle that undergirds intelligent agents in the aima senseto begin we assume that the human designer after studying the world uses the language of a particular logical system to give to our agent an initial set of beliefs delta0 about what this world is like in doing so the designer works with a formal model of this world w and ensures that wmodelsdelta0 following tradition we refer to delta0 as the agent’s starting knowledge base this terminology given that we are talking about the agent’s beliefs is known to be peculiar but it persists next the agent adjusts its knowlege base to produce a new one delta1 we say that adjustment is carried out by way of an operation mathcala so mathcaladelta0delta1 how does the adjustment process mathcala work there are many possibilities unfortunately many believe that the simplest possibility viz mathcaladeltai equals the set of all formulas that can be deduced in some elementary manner from deltai exhausts all the possibilities the reality is that adjustment as indicated above can come by way of any mode of reasoning – induction abduction and yes various forms of deduction corresponding to the logical system in play for present purposes it’s not important that we carefully enumerate all the optionsthe cycle continues when the agent acts on the environment in an attempt to secure its goals acting of course can cause changes to the environment at this point the agent senses the environment and this new information gamma1 factors into the process of adjustment so that mathcaladelta1cupgamma1delta2 the cycle of senses rightarrow adjusts rightarrow acts continues to produce the life delta0delta1delta2delta3ldots … of our agentit may strike you as preposterous that logicist ai be touted as an approach taken to replicate all of cognition reasoning over formulae in some logical system might be appropriate for computationally capturing highlevel tasks like trying to solve a math problem or devising an outline for an entry in the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy but how could such reasoning apply to tasks like those a hawk tackles when swooping down to capture scurrying prey in the human sphere the task successfully negotiated by athletes would seem to be in the same category surely some will declare an outfielder chasing down a fly ball doesn’t prove theorems to figure out how to pull off a diving catch to save the game two brutally reductionistic arguments can be given in support of this “logicist theory of everything” approach towards cognition the first stems from the fact that a complete proof calculus for just firstorder logic can simulate all of turinglevel computation chapter 11 boolos et al 2007 the second justification comes from the role logic plays in foundational theories of mathematics and mathematical reasoning not only are foundational theories of mathematics cast in logic potter 2004 but there have been successful projects resulting in machine verification of ordinary nontrivial theorems eg in the mizar project alone around 50000 theorems have been verified naumowicz and kornilowicz 2009 the argument goes that if any approach to ai can be cast mathematically then it can be cast in a logicist formneedless to say such a declaration has been carefully considered by logicists beyond the reductionistic argument given above for example rosenschein and kaelbling 1986 describe a method in which logic is used to specify finite state machines these machines are used at “run time” for rapid reactive processing in this approach though the finite state machines contain no logic in the traditional sense they are produced by logic and inference real robot control via firstorder theorem proving has been demonstrated by amir and maynardreid 1999 2000 2001 in fact you can download version 20 of the software that makes this approach real for a nomad 200 mobile robot in an office environment of course negotiating an office environment is a far cry from the rapid adjustments an outfielder for the yankees routinely puts on display but certainly it’s an open question as to whether future machines will be able to mimic such feats through rapid reasoning the question is open if for no other reason than that all must concede that the constant increase in reasoning speed of firstorder theorem provers is breathtaking for uptodate news on this increase visit and monitor the tptp site there is no known reason why the software engineering in question cannot continue to produce speed gains that would eventually allow an artificial creature to catch a fly ball by processing information in purely logicist fashionnow we come to the second topic related to logicist ai that warrants mention herein common logic and the intensifying quest for interoperability between logicbased systems using different logics only a few brief comments are offered29 readers wanting more can explore the links provided in the course of the summaryone standardization is through what is known as common logic cl and variants thereof cl is published as an iso standard – iso is the international standards organization philosophers interested in logic and of course logicians will find cl to be quite fascinating from an historical perspective the advent of cl is interesting in no small part because the person spearheading it is none other than pat hayes the same hayes who as we have seen worked with mccarthy to establish logicist ai in the 1960s though hayes was not at the original 1956 dartmouth conference he certainly must be regarded as one of the founders of contemporary ai one of the interesting things about cl at least as we see it is that it signifies a trend toward the marriage of logics and programming languages and environments another system that is a logicprogramming hybrid is athena which can be used as a programming language and is at the same time a form of msl athena is based on formal systems known as denotational proof languages arkoudas 2000how is interoperability between two systems to be enabled by cl suppose one of these systems is based on logic l and the other on l to ease exposition assume that both logics are firstorder the idea is that a theory phil that is a set of formulae in l can be translated into cl producing phicl and then this theory can be translated into phil cl thus becomes an inter lingua note that what counts as a wellformed formula in l can be different than what counts as one in l the two logics might also have different proof theories for example inference in l might be based on resolution while inference in l is of the natural deduction variety finally the symbol sets will be different despite these differences courtesy of the translations desired behavior can be produced across the translation that at any rate is the hope the technical challenges here are immense but federal monies are increasingly available for attacks on the problem of interoperabilitynow for the third topic in this section what can be called encoding down the technique is easy to understand suppose that we have on hand a set phi of firstorder axioms as is wellknown the problem of deciding for arbitrary formula phi whether or not it’s deducible from phi is turingundecidable there is no turing machine or equivalent that can correctly return “yes” or “no” in the general case however if the domain in question is finite we can encode this problem down to the propositional calculus an assertion that all things have f is of course equivalent to the assertion that fa fb fc as long as the domain contains only these three objects so here a firstorder quantified formula becomes a conjunction in the propositional calculus determining whether such conjunctions are provable from axioms themselves expressed in the propositional calculus is turingdecidable and in addition in certain clusters of cases the check can be done very quickly in the propositional case very quickly readers interested in encoding down to the propositional calculus should consult recent darpasponsored work by bart selman please note that the target of encoding down doesn’t need to be the propositional calculus because it’s generally harder for machines to find proofs in an intensional logic than in straight firstorder logic it is often expedient to encode down the former to the latter for example propositional modal logic can be encoded in multisorted logic a variant of fol see arkoudas bringsjord 2005 prominent usage of such an encoding down can be found in a set of systems known as description logics which are a set of logics less expressive than firstorder logic but more expressive than propositional logic baader et al 2003 description logics are used to reason about ontologies in a given domain and have been successfully used for example in the biomedical domain smith et al 2007it’s tempting to define nonlogicist ai by negation an approach to building intelligent agents that rejects the distinguishing features of logicist ai such a shortcut would imply that the agents engineered by nonlogicist ai researchers and developers whatever the virtues of such agents might be cannot be said to know that phi – for the simple reason that by negation the nonlogicist paradigm would have not even a single declarative proposition that is a candidate for phi however this isn’t a particularly enlightening way to define nonsymbolic ai a more productive approach is to say that nonsymbolic ai is ai carried out on the basis of particular formalisms other than logical systems and to then enumerate those formalisms it will turn out of course that these formalisms fail to include knowledge in the normal sense in philosophy as is wellknown the normal sense is one according to which if p is known p is a declarative statementfrom the standpoint of formalisms other than logical systems nonlogicist ai can be partitioned into symbolic but nonlogicist approaches and connectionistneurocomputational approaches ai carried out on the basis of symbolic declarative structures that for readability and ease of use are not treated directly by researchers as elements of formal logics does not count in this category fall traditional semantic networks schank’s 1972 conceptual dependency scheme framebased schemes and other such schemes the former approaches today are probabilistic and are based on the formalisms bayesian networks covered below the latter approaches are based as we have noted on formalisms that can be broadly termed “neurocomputational” given our space constraints only one of the formalisms in this category is described here and briefly at that the aforementioned artificial neural networks30 though artificial neural networks with an appropriate architecture could be used for arbitrary computation they are almost exclusively used for building learning systemsneural nets are composed of units or nodes designed to represent neurons which are connected by links designed to represent dendrites each of which has a numeric weighta “neuron” within an artificial neural network from aima3eit is usually assumed that some of the units work in symbiosis with the external environment these units form the sets of input and output units each unit has a current activation level which is its output and can compute based on its inputs and weights on those inputs its activation level at the next moment in time this computation is entirely local a unit takes account of but its neighbors in the net this local computation is calculated in two stages first the input function ini gives the weighted sum of the unit’s input values that is the sum of the input activations multiplied by their weightsin the second stage the activation function g takes the input from the first stage as argument and generates the output or activation level aione common and confessedly elementary choice for the activation function which usually governs all units in a given net is the step function which usually has a threshold t that sees to it that a 1 is output when the input is greater than t and that 0 is output otherwise this is supposed to be “brainlike” to some degree given that 1 represents the firing of a pulse from a neuron through an axon and 0 represents no firing a simple threelayer neural net is shown in the following picturea simple threelayer artificial neural network from aima3eas you might imagine there are many different kinds of neural networks the main distinction is between feedforward and recurrent networks in feedforward networks like the one pictured immediately above as their name suggests links move information in one direction and there are no cycles recurrent networks allow for cycling back and can become rather complicated for a more detailed presentation see thesupplement on neural netsneural networks were fundamentally plagued by the fact that while they are simple and have theoretically efficient learning algorithms when they are multilayered and thus sufficiently expressive to represent nonlinear functions they were very hard to train in practice this changed in the mid 2000s with the advent of methods that exploit stateoftheart hardware better rajat et al 2009 the backpropagation method for training multilayered neural networks can be translated into a sequence of repeated simple arithmetic operations on a large set of numbers the general trend in computing hardware has favored algorithms that are able to do a large of number of simple operations that are not that dependent on each other versus a small of number of complex and intricate operationsanother key recent observation is that deep neural networks can be pretrained first in an unsupervised phase where they are just fed data without any labels for the data each hidden layer is forced to represent the outputs of the layer below the outcome of this training is a series of layers which represent the input domain with increasing levels of abstraction for example if we pretrain the network with images of faces we would get a first layer which is good at detecting edges in images a second layer which can combine edges to form facial features such as eyes noses etc a third layer which responds to groups of features and so on lecun et al 2015perhaps the best technique for teaching students about neural networks in the context of other statistical learning formalisms and methods is to focus on a specific problem preferably one that seems unnatural to tackle using logicist techniques the task is then to seek to engineer a solution to the problem using any and all techniques available one nice problem is handwriting recognition which also happens to have a rich philosophical dimension see eg hofstadter mcgraw 1995 for example consider the problem of assigning given as input a handwritten digit d the correct digit 0 through 9 because there is a database of 60000 labeled digits available to researchers from the national institute of science and technology this problem has evolved into a benchmark problem for comparing learning algorithms it turns out that neural networks currently reign as the best approach to the problem according to a recent ranking by benenson 2016readers interested in ai and computational cognitive science pursued from an overtly brainbased orientation are encouraged to explore the work of rick granger 2004a 2004b and researchers in his brain engineering laboratory and w h neukom institute for computational sciences the contrast between the “dry” logicist ai started at the original 1956 conference and the approach taken here by granger and associates in which brain circuitry is directly modeled is remarkable for those interested in computational properties of neural networks hornik et al 1989 address the general representation capability of neural networks independent of learningat this point the reader has been exposed to the chief formalisms in ai and may wonder about heterogeneous approaches that bridge them is there such research and development in ai yes from an engineering standpoint such work makes irresistibly good sense there is now an understanding that in order to build applications that get the job done one should choose from a toolbox that includes logicist probabilisticbayesian and neurocomputational techniques given that the original topdown logicist paradigm is alive and thriving eg see brachman levesque 2004 mueller 2006 and that as noted a resurgence of bayesian and neurocomputational approaches has placed these two paradigms on solid fertile footing as well ai now moves forward armed with this fundamental triad and it is a virtual certainty that applications eg robots will be engineered by drawing from elements of all three watson’s deepqa architecture is one recent example of an engineering system that leverages multiple paradigms for a detailed discussion see thesupplement on watson’s deepqa architecturegoogle deepmind’s alphago is another example of a multiparadigm system although in a much narrower form than watson the central algorithmic problem in games such as go or chess is to search through a vast sequence of valid moves for most nontrivial games this is not feasible to do so exhaustively the monte carlo tree search mcts algorithm gets around this obstacle by searching through an enormous space of valid moves in a statistical fashion browne et al 2012 while mcts is the central algorithm in alpago there are two neural networks which help evaluate states in the game and help model how expert opponents play silver et al 2016 it should be noted that mcts is behind almost all the winning submissions in general game playing finnsson 2012what though about deep theoretical integration of the main paradigms in ai such integration is at present only a possibility for the future but readers are directed to the research of some striving for such integration for example sun 1994 2002 has been working to demonstrate that human cognition that is on its face symbolic in nature eg professional philosophizing in the analytic tradition which deals explicitly with arguments and definitions carefully symbolized can arise from cognition that is neurocomputational in nature koller 1997 has investigated the marriage between probability theory and logic and in general the very recent arrival of socalled humanlevel ai is being led by theorists seeking to genuinely integrate the three paradigms set out above eg cassimatis 2006finally we note that cognitive architectures such as soar laird 2012 and polyscheme cassimatis 2006 are another area where integration of different fields of ai can be found for example one such endeavor striving to build humanlevel ai is the companions project forbus and hinrichs 2006 companions are longlived systems that strive to be humanlevel ai systems that function as collaborators with humans the companions architecture tries to solve multiple ai problems such as reasoning and learning interactivity and longevity in one unifying systemas we noted above work on ai has mushroomed over the past couple of decades now that we have looked a bit at the content that composes ai we take a quick look at the explosive growth of aifirst a point of clarification the growth of which we speak is not a shallow sort correlated with amount of funding provided for a given subfield of ai that kind of thing happens all the time in all fields and can be triggered by entirely political and financial changes designed to grow certain areas and diminish others along the same line the growth of which we speak is not correlated with the amount of industrial activity revolving around ai or a subfield thereof for this sort of growth too can be driven by forces quite outside an expansion in the scientific breadth of ai31 rather we are speaking of an explosion of deep content new material which someone intending to be conversant with the field needs to know relative to other fields the size of the explosion may or may not be unprecedented though it should perhaps be noted that an analogous increase in philosophy would be marked by the development of entirely new formalisms for reasoning reflected in the fact that say longstanding philosophy textbooks like copi’s 2004 introduction to logic are dramatically rewritten and enlarged to include these formalisms rather than remaining anchored to essentially immutable core formalisms with incremental refinement around the edges through the years but it certainly appears to be quite remarkable and is worth taking note of here if for no other reason than that ai’s nearfuture will revolve in significant part around whether or not the new content in question forms a foundation for new longlived research and development that would not otherwise obtain32ai has also witnessed an explosion in its usage in various artifacts and applications while we are nowhere near building a machine with capabilities of a human or one that acts rationally in all scenarios according to the russellhutter definition above algorithms that have their origins in ai research are now widely deployed for many tasks in a variety of domainsa huge part of ai’s growth in applications has been made possible through invention of new algorithms in the subfield of machine learning machine learning is concerned with building systems that improve their performance on a task when given examples of ideal performance on the task or improve their performance with repeated experience on the task algorithms from machine learning have been used in speech recognition systems spam filters online frauddetection systems productrecommendation systems etc the current stateoftheart in machine learning can be divided into three areas murphy 2013 alpaydin 2014in addition to being used in domains that are traditionally the ken of ai machinelearning algorithms have also been used in all stages of the scientific process for example machinelearning techniques are now routinely applied to analyze large volumes of data generated from particle accelerators cern for instance generates a petabyte 1015 bytes per second and statistical algorithms that have their origins in ai are used to filter and analyze this data particle accelerators are used in fundamental experimental research in physics to probe the structure of our physical universe they work by colliding larger particles together to create much finer particles not all such events are fruitful machinelearning methods have been used to select events which are then analyzed further whiteson whiteson 2009 and baldi et al 2014 more recently researchers at cern launched a machine learning competition to aid in the analysis of the higgs boson the goal of this challenge was to develop algorithms that separate meaningful events from background noise given data from the large hadron collider a particle accelerator at cernin the past few decades there has been an explosion in data that does not have any explicit semantics attached to it this data is generated by both humans and machines most of this data is not easily machineprocessable for example images text video as opposed to carefully curated data in a knowledge or database this has given rise to a huge industry that applies ai techniques to get usable information from such enormous data this field of applying techniques derived from ai to large volumes of data goes by names such as “data mining” “big data” “analytics” etc this field is too vast to even moderately cover in the present article but we note that there is no full agreement on what constitutes such a “bigdata” problem one definition from madden 2012 is that big data differs from traditional machineprocessable data in that it is too big for most of the existing stateoftheart hardware too quick generated at a fast rate eg online email transactions or too hard it is in the toohard part that ai techniques work quite well while this universe is quite varied we use the watson’s system later in this article as an airelevant exemplar as we will see later while most of this new explosion is powered by learning it isn’t entirely limited to just learning this bloom in learning algorithms has been supported by both a resurgence in neurocomputational techniques and probabilistic techniquesone of the remarkable aspects of charniak mcdermott 1985 is this the authors say the central dogma of ai is that “what the brain does may be thought of at some level as a kind of computation” p 6 and yet nowhere in the book is brainlike computation discussed in fact you will search the index in vain for the term ‘neural’ and its variants please note that the authors are not to blame for this a large part of ai’s growth has come from formalisms tools and techniques that are in some sense brainbased not logicbased a paper that conveys the importance and maturity of neurocomputation is litt et al 2006 growth has also come from a return of probabilistic techniques that had withered by the mid70s and 80s more about that momentarily in the next “resurgence” sectionone very prominent class of nonlogicist formalism does make an explicit nod in the direction of the brain viz artificial neural networks or as they are often simply called neural networks or even just neural nets the structure of neural networks and more recent developments are discussed above because minsky and pappert’s 1969 perceptrons led many including specifically many sponsors of ai research and development to conclude that neural networks didn’t have sufficient informationprocessing power to model human cognition the formalism was pretty much universally dropped from ai however minsky and pappert had only considered very limited neural networks connectionism the view that intelligence consists not in symbolic processing but rather nonsymbolic processing at least somewhat like what we find in the brain at least at the cellular level approximated specifically by artificial neural networks came roaring back in the early 1980s on the strength of more sophisticated forms of such networks and soon the situation was to use a metaphor introduced by john mccarthy that of two horses in a race toward building truly intelligent agentsif one had to pick a year at which connectionism was resurrected it would certainly be 1986 the year parallel distributed processing rumelhart mcclelland 1986 appeared in print the rebirth of connectionism was specifically fueled by the backpropagation backpropagation algorithm over neural networks nicely covered in chapter 20 of aima the symbolicistconnectionist race led to a spate of lively debate in the literature eg smolensky 1988 bringsjord 1991 and some ai engineers have explicitly championed a methodology marked by a rejection of knowledge representation and reasoning for example rodney brooks was such an engineer he wrote the wellknown “intelligence without representation” 1991 and his cog project to which we referred above is arguably an incarnation of the premeditatedly nonlogicist approach increasingly however those in the business of building sophisticated systems find that both logicist and more neurocomputational techniques are required wermter sun 200133 in addition the neurocomputational paradigm today includes connectionism only as a proper part in light of the fact that some of those working on building intelligent systems strive to do so by engineering brainbased computation outside the neural networkbased approach eg granger 2004a 2004banother recent resurgence in neurocomputational techniques has occurred in machine learning the modus operandi in machine learning is that given a problem say recognizing handwritten digits 01ldots9 or faces from a 2d matrix representing an image of the digits or faces a machine learning or a domain expert would construct a feature vector representation function for the task this function is a transformation of the input into a format that tries to throw away irrelevant information in the input and keep only information useful for the task inputs transformed by rr are termed features for recognizing faces irrelevant information could be the amount of lighting in the scene and relevant information could be information about facial features the machine is then fed a sequence of inputs represented by the features and the ideal or ground truth output values for those inputs this converts the learning challenge from that of having to learn the function ff from the examples leftleftlangle x1 ffx1rightrangleleftlangle x2 ffx2rightrangle ldots leftlangle xn ffxnrightrangle right to having to learn from possibly easier data leftleftlangle rrx1 ffx1rightrangleleftlangle rrx2 ffx2rightrangle ldots leftlangle rrxn ffxnrightrangle right here the function rr is the function that computes the feature vector representation of the input formally ff is assumed to be a composition of the functions gg and rr that is for any input x fx ggleftrrleftxrightright this is denoted by ffggcirc rr for any input the features are first computed and then the function gg is applied if the feature representation rr is provided by the domain expert the learning problem becomes simpler to the extent the feature representation takes on the difficulty of the task at one extreme the feature vector could hide an easily extractable form of the answer in the input and in the other extreme the feature representation could be just the plain inputfor nontrivial problems choosing the right representation is vital for instance one of the drastic changes in the ai landscape was due to minsky and papert’s 1969 demonstration that the perceptron cannot learn even the binary xor function but this function can be learnt by the perceptron if we have the right representation feature engineering has grown to be one of the most labor intensive tasks of machine learning so much so that it is considered to be one of the “black arts” of machine learning the other significant black art of learning methods is choosing the right parameters these black arts require significant human expertise and experience which can be quite difficult to obtain without significant apprenticeship domingos 2012 another bigger issue is that the task of feature engineering is just knowledge representation in a new skingiven this state of affairs there has been a recent resurgence in methods for automatically learning a feature representation function rr such methods potentially bypass a large part of human labor that is traditionally required such methods are based mostly on what are now termed deep neural networks such networks are simply neural networks with two or more hidden layers these networks allow us to learn a feature function rr by using one or more of the hidden layers to learn rr the general form of learning in which one learns from the raw sensory data without much handbased feature engineering has now its own term deep learning a general and yet concise definition bengio et al 2015 isthough the idea has been around for decades recent innovations leading to more efficient learning techniques have made the approach more feasible bengio et al 2013 deeplearning methods have recently produced stateoftheart results in image recognition given an image containing various objects label the objects from a given set of labels speech recognition from audio input generate a textual representation and the analysis of data from particle accelerators lecun et al 2015 despite impressive results in tasks such as these minor and major issues remain unresolved a minor issue is that significant human expertise is still needed to choose an architecture and set up the right parameters for the architecture a major issue is the existence of socalled adversarial inputs which are indistinguishable from normal inputs to humans but are computed in a special manner that makes a neural network regard them as different than similar inputs in the training data the existence of such adversarial inputs which remain stable across training data has raised doubts about how well performance on benchmarks can translate into performance in realworld systems with sensory noise szegedy et al 2014there is a second dimension to the explosive growth of ai the explosion in popularity of probabilistic methods that aren’t neurocomputational in nature in order to formalize and mechanize a form of nonlogicist reasoning in the face of uncertainty interestingly enough it is eugene charniak himself who can be safely considered one of the leading proponents of an explicit premeditated turn away from logic to statistical techniques his area of specialization is natural language processing and whereas his introductory textbook of 1985 gave an accurate sense of his approach to parsing at the time as we have seen write computer programs that given english text as input ultimately infer meaning expressed in fol this approach was abandoned in favor of purely statistical approaches charniak 1993 at the ai50 conference charniak boldly proclaimed in a talk tellingly entitled “why natural language processing is now statistical natural language processing” that logicist ai is moribund and that the statistical approach is the only promising game in town – for the next 50 years34the chief source of energy and debate at the conference flowed from the clash between charniak’s probabilistic orientation and the original logicist orientation upheld at the conference in question by john mccarthy and othersai’s use of probability theory grows out of the standard form of this theory which grew directly out of technical philosophy and logic this form will be familiar to many philosophers but let’s review it quickly now in order to set a firm stage for making points about the new probabilistic techniques that have energized aijust as in the case of fol in probability theory we are concerned with declarative statements or propositions to which degrees of belief are applied we can thus say that both logicist and probabilistic approaches are symbolic in nature both approaches also agree that statements can either be true or false in the world in building agents a simplistic logicbased approach requires agents to know the truthvalue of all possible statements this is not realistic as an agent may not know the truthvalue of some proposition p due to either ignorance nondeterminism in the physical world or just plain vagueness in the meaning of the statement more specifically the fundamental proposition in probability theory is a random variable which can be conceived of as an aspect of the world whose status is initially unknown to the agent we usually capitalize the names of random variables though we reserve pqr ldots as such names as well for example in a particular murder investigation centered on whether or not mr black committed the crime the random variable guilty might be of concern the detective may be interested as well in whether or not the murder weapon – a particular knife let us assume – belongs to black in light of this we might say that weapon true if it does and weapon false if it doesn’t as a notational convenience we can write weapon and lnot weapon and for these two cases respectively and we can use this convention for other variables of this typethe kind of variables we have described so far are mathbfboolean because their mathbfdomain is simply truefalse but we can generalize and allow mathbfdiscrete random variables whose values are from any countable domain for example pricetchina might be a variable for the price of a particular presumably tea in china and its domain might be 12345 where each number here is in us dollars a third type of variable is mathbfcontinous its domain is either the reals or some subset thereofwe say that an atomic event is an assignment of particular values from the appropriate domains to all the variables composing the idealized world for example in the simple murder investigation world introduced just above we have two boolean variables guilty and weapon and there are just four atomic events note that atomic events have some obvious properties for example they are mutually exclusive exhaustive and logically entail the truth or falsity of every proposition usually not obvious to beginning students is a fourth property namely any proposition is logically equivalent to the disjunction of all atomic events that entail that propositionprior probabilities correspond to a degree of belief accorded to a proposition in the complete absence of any other information for example if the prior probability of black’s guilt is 02 we write pleftguiltytrueright02or simply pguilty02 it is often convenient to have a notation allowing one to refer economically to the probabilities of all the possible values for a random variable for example we can write pleftpricetchinarightas an abbreviation for the five equations listing all the possible prices for tea in china we can also write pleftpricetchinarightlangle 12345ranglein addition as further convenient notation we can write mathbfpleftguilty weaponright to denote the probabilities of all combinations of values of the relevant set of random variables this is referred to as the joint probability distribution of guilty and weapon the full joint probability distribution covers the distribution for all the random variables used to describe a world given our simple murder world we have 20 atomic events summed up in the equation mathbfpleftguilty weapon pricetchinarightthe final piece of the basic language of probability theory corresponds to conditional probabilities where p and q are any propositions the relevant expression is pleftpgiven qright which can be interpreted as “the probability of p given that all we know is q” for example pleftguiltyggiven weaponright07says that if the murder weapon belongs to black and no other information is available the probability that black is guilty is 07andrei kolmogorov showed how to construct probability theory from three axioms that make use of the machinery now introduced vizthese axioms are clearly at bottom logicist the remainder of probability theory can be erected from this foundation conditional probabilities are easily defined in terms of prior probabilities we can thus say that logic is in some fundamental sense still being used to characterize the set of beliefs that a rational agent can have but where does probabilistic inference enter the picture on this account since traditional deduction is not used for inference in probability theoryprobabilistic inference consists in computing from observed evidence expressed in terms of probability theory posterior probabilities of propositions of interest for a good long while there have been algorithms for carrying out such computation these algorithms precede the resurgence of probabilistic techniques in the 1990s chapter 13 of aima presents a number of them for example given the kolmogorov axioms here is a straightforward way of computing the probability of any proposition using the full joint distribution giving the probabilities of all atomic events where p is some proposition let alphap be the disjunction of all atomic events in which p holds since the probability of a proposition ie pp is equal to the sum of the probabilities of the atomic events in which it holds we have an equation that provides a method for computing the probability of any proposition p vizunfortunately there were two serious problems infecting this original probabilistic approach one the processing in question needed to take place over paralyzingly large amounts of information enumeration over the entire distribution is required and two the expressivity of the approach was merely propositional it was by the way the philosopher hilary putnam 1963 who pointed out that there was a price to pay in moving to the firstorder level the issue is not discussed herein everything changed with the advent of a new formalism that marks the marriage of probabilism and graph theory bayesian networks also called belief nets the pivotal text was pearl 1988 for a more detailed discussion see thesupplement on bayesian networksbefore concluding this section it is probably worth noting that from the standpoint of philosophy a situation such as the murder investigation we have exploited above would often be analyzed into arguments and strength factors not into numbers to be crunched by purely arithmetical procedures for example in the epistemology of roderick chisholm as presented his theory of knowledge 1966 1977 detective holmes might classify a proposition like black committed the murder as counterbalanced if he was unable to find a compelling argument either way or perhaps probable if the murder weapon turned out to belong to black such categories cannot be found on a continuum from 0 to 1 and they are used in articulating arguments for or against black’s guilt argumentbased approaches to uncertain and defeasible reasoning are virtually nonexistent in ai one exception is pollock’s approach covered below this approach is chisholmian in natureit should also be noted that there have been wellestablished formalisms for dealing with probabilistic reasoning as an instance of logicbased reasoning eg the activity a researcher in probabilistic reasoning undertakes when she proves a theorem phi about their domain eg any theorem in pearl 1988 is purely within the realm of traditional logic readers interested in logicflavored approaches to probabilistic reasoning can consult adams 1996 hailperin 1996 2010 halpern 1998 formalisms marrying probability theory induction and deductive reasoning placing them on an equal footing have been on the rise with markov logic richardson and domingos 2006 being salient among these approachesprobabilistic machine learningmachine learning in the sense given above has been associated with probabilistic techniques probabilistic techniques have been associated with both the learning of functions eg naive bayes classification and the modeling of theoretical properties of learning algorithms for example a standard reformulation of supervised learning casts it as a bayesian problem assume that we are looking at recognizing digits 09 from a given image one way to cast this problem is to ask what the probability that the hypothesis hx “the digit is x” is true given the image d from a sensor bayes theorem gives uspdgiven hx and phx can be estimated from the given training dataset then the hypothesis with the highest posterior probability is then given as the answer and is given by argmaxxpleftdggiven hxrightplefthxright in addition to probabilistic methods being used to build algorithms probability theory has also been used to analyze algorithms which might not have an overt probabilistic or logical formulation for example one of the central classes of metatheorems in learning probably approximately correct pac theorems are cast in terms of lower bounds of the probability that the mismatch between the inducedlearnt fl function and the true function ft being less than a certain amount given that the learnt function fl works well for a certain number of cases see chapter 18 aimafrom at least its modern inception ai has always been connected to gadgets often ones produced by corporations and it would be remiss of us not to say a few words about this phenomenon while there have been a large number of commercial inthewild success stories for ai and its sister fields such as optimization and decisionmaking some applications are more visible and have been thoroughly battletested in the wild in 2014 one of the most visible such domains one in which ai has been strikingly successful is information retrieval incarnated as web search another recent success story is pattern recognition the stateoftheart in applied pattern recognition eg fingerprintface verification speech recognition and handwriting recognition is robust enough to allow “highstakes” deployment outside the laboratory as of mid 2018 several corporations and research laboratories have begun testing autonomous vehicles on public roads with even a handful of jurisdictions making selfdriving cars legal to operate for example google’s autonomous cars have navigated hundreds of thousands of miles in california with minimal human help under nontrivial conditions guizzo 2011computer games provide a robust test bed for ai techniques as they can capture important parts that might be necessary to test an ai technique while abstracting or removing details that might beyond the scope of core ai research for example designing better hardware or dealing with legal issues laird and vanlent 2001 one subclass of games that has seen quite fruitful for commercial deployment of ai is realtime strategy games realtime strategy games are games in which players manage an army given limited resources one objective is to constantly battle other players and reduce an opponent’s forces realtime strategy games differ from strategy games in that players plan their actions simultaneously in realtime and do not have to take turns playing such games have a number of challenges that are tantalizing within the grasp of the stateoftheart this makes such games an attractive venue in which to deploy simple ai agents an overview of ai used in realtime strategy games can be found in robertson and watson 2015some other ventures in ai despite significant success have been only chugging slowly and humbly along quietly for instance airelated methods have achieved triumphs in solving open problems in mathematics that have resisted any solution for decades the most noteworthy instance of such a problem is perhaps a proof of the statement that “all robbins algebras are boolean algebras” this was conjectured in the 1930s and the proof was finally discovered by the otter automatic theoremprover in 1996 after just a few months of effort kolata 1996 wos 2013 sister fields like formal verification have also bloomed to the extent that it is now not too difficult to semiautomatically verify vital hardwaresoftware components kaufmann et al 2000 and chajed et al 2017other related areas such as natural language translation still have a long way to go but are good enough to let us use them under restricted conditions the jury is out on tasks such as machine translation which seems to require both statistical methods lopez 2008 and symbolic methods españabonet 2011 both methods now have comparable but limited success in the wild a deployed translation system at ford that was initially developed for translating manufacturing process instructions from english to other languages initially started out as rulebased system with ford and domainspecific vocabulary and language this system then evolved to incorporate statistical techniques along with rulebased techniques as it gained new uses beyond translating manuals for example lay users within ford translating their own documents rychtyckyj and plesco 2012ai’s great achievements mentioned above so far have all been in limited narrow domains this lack of any success in the unrestricted general case has caused a small set of researchers to break away into what is now called artificial general intelligence goertzel and pennachin 2007 the stated goals of this movement include shifting the focus again to building artifacts that are generally intelligent and not just capable in one narrow domaincomputer ethics has been around for a long time in this subfield typically one would consider how one ought to act in a certain class of situations involving computer technology where the “one” here refers to a human being moor 1985 socalled “robot ethics” is different in this subfield which goes by names such as “moral ai” “ethical ai” “machine ethics” “moral robots” etc one is confronted with such prospects as robots being able to make autonomous and weighty decisions – decisions that might or might not be morally permissible wallach allen 2010 if one were to attempt to engineer a robot with a capacity for sophisticated ethical reasoning and decisionmaking one would also be doing philosophical ai as that concept is characterized elsewhere in the present entry there can be many different flavors of approaches toward moral ai wallach and allen 2010 provide a highlevel overview of the different approaches moral reasoning is obviously needed in robots that have the capability for lethal action arkin 2009 provides an introduction to how we can control and regulate machines that have the capacity for lethal behavior moral ai goes beyond obviously lethal situations and we can have a spectrum of moral machines moor 2006 provides one such spectrum of possbile moral agents an example of a nonlethal but ethicallycharged machine would be a lying machine clark 2010 uses a computational theory of the mind the ability to represent and reason about other agents to build a lying machine that successfully persuades people into believing falsehoods bello bringsjord 2013 give a general overview of what might be required to build a moral machine one of the ingredients being a theory of mindthe most general framework for building machines that can reason ethically consists in endowing the machines with a moral code this requires that the formal framework used for reasoning by the machine be expressive enough to receive such codes the field of moral ai for now is not concerned with the source or provenance of such codes the source could be humans and the machine could receive the code directly via explicit encoding or indirectly reading another possibility is that the code is inferred by the machine from a more basic set of laws we assume that the robot has access to some such code and we then try to engineer the robot to follow that code under all circumstances while making sure that the moral code and its representation do not lead to unintended consequences deontic logics are a class of formal logics that have been studied the most for this purpose abstractly such logics are concerned mainly with what follows from a given moral code engineering then studies the match of a given deontic logic to a moral code ie is the logic expressive enough which has to be balanced with the ease of automation bringsjord et al 2006 provide a blueprint for using deontic logics to build systems that can perform actions in accordance with a moral code the role deontic logics play in the framework offered by bringsjord et al which can be considered to be representative of the field of deontic logic for moral ai can be best understood as striving towards leibniz’s dream of a universal moral calculusdeontic logicbased frameworks can also be used in a fashion that is analogous to moral selfreflection in this mode logicbased verification of the robot’s internal modules can done before the robot ventures out into the real world govindarajulu and bringsjord 2015 present an approach drawing from formalprogram verification in which a deonticlogic based system could be used to verify that a robot acts in a certain ethicallysanctioned manner under certain conditions since formalverification approaches can be used to assert statements about an infinite number of situations and conditions such approaches might be preferred to having the robot roam around in an ethicallycharged test environment and make a finite set of decisions that are then judged for their ethical correctness more recently govindarajulu and bringsjord 2017 use a deontic logic to present a computational model of the doctrine of double effect an ethical principle for moral dilemmas that has been studied empirically and analyzed extensively by philosophers35 the principle is usually presented and motivated via dilemmas using trolleys and was first presented in this fashion by foot 1967while there has been substantial theoretical and philosophical work the field of machine ethics is still in its infancy there has been some embryonic work in building ethical machines one recent such example would be pereira and saptawijaya 2016 who use logic programming and base their work in machine ethics on the ethical theory known as contractualism set out by scanlon 1982 and what about the future since artificial agents are bound to get smarter and smarter and to have more and more autonomy and responsibility robot ethics is almost certainly going to grow in importance this endeavor might not be a straightforward application of classical ethics for example experimental results suggest that humans hold robots to different ethical standards than they expect from humans under similar conditions malle et al 201536notice that the heading for this section isn’t philosophy of ai we’ll get to that category momentarily for now it can be identified with the attempt to answer such questions as whether artificial agents created in ai can ever reach the full heights of human intelligence philosophical ai is ai not philosophy but it’s ai rooted in and flowing from philosophy for example one could engage using the tools and techniques of philosophy a paradox work out a proposed solution and then proceed to a step that is surely optional for philosophers expressing the solution in terms that can be translated into a computer program that when executed allows an artificial agent to surmount concrete instances of the original paradox37 before we ostensively characterize philosophical ai of this sort courtesy of a particular research program let us consider first the view that ai is in fact simply philosophy or a part thereofdaniel dennett 1979 has famously claimed not just that there are parts of ai intimately bound up with philosophy but that ai is philosophy and psychology at least of the cognitive sort he has made a parallel claim about artificial life dennett 1998 this view will turn out to be incorrect but the reasons why it’s wrong will prove illuminating and our discussion will pave the way for a discussion of philosophical aiwhat does dennett say exactly thiselsewhere he says his view is that ai should be viewed “as a most abstract inquiry into the possibility of intelligence or knowledge” dennett 1979 64in short dennett holds that ai is the attempt to explain intelligence not by studying the brain in the hopes of identifying components to which cognition can be reduced and not by engineering small informationprocessing units from which one can build in bottomup fashion to highlevel cognitive processes but rather by – and this is why he says the approach is topdown – designing and implementing abstract algorithms that capture cognition leaving aside the fact that at least starting in the early 1980s ai includes an approach that is in some sense bottomup see the neurocomputational paradigm discussed above in nonlogicist ai a summary and see specifically granger’s 2004a 2004b work hyperlinked in text immediately above a specific counterexample a fatal flaw infects dennett’s view dennett sees the potential flaw as reflected indennett has a ready answer to this objection he writesunfortunately this is acutely problematic and examination of the problems throws light on the nature of aifirst insofar as philosophy and psychology are concerned with the nature of mind they aren’t in the least trammeled by the presupposition that mentation consists in computation ai at least of the “strong” variety we’ll discuss “strong” versus “weak” ai below is indeed an attempt to substantiate through engineering certain impressive artifacts the thesis that intelligence is at bottom computational at the level of turing machines and their equivalents eg register machines so there is a philosophical claim for sure but this doesn’t make ai philosophy any more than some of the deeper more aggressive claims of some physicists eg that the universe is ultimately digital in nature make their field philosophy philosophy of physics certainly entertains the proposition that the physical universe can be perfectly modeled in digital terms in a series of cellular automata eg but of course philosophy of physics can’t be identified with this doctrinesecond we now know well and those familiar with the relevant formal terrain knew at the time of dennett’s writing that information processing can exceed standard computation that is can exceed computation at and below the level of what a turing machine can muster turingcomputation we shall say such information processing is known as hypercomputation a term coined by philosopher jack copeland who has himself defined such machines eg copeland 1998 the first machines capable of hypercomputation were trialanderror machines introduced in the same famous issue of the journal of symbolic logic gold 1965 putnam 1965 a new hypercomputer is the infinite time turing machine hamkins lewis 2000 dennett’s appeal to church’s thesis thus flies in the face of the mathematical facts some varieties of information processing exceed standard computation or turingcomputation church’s thesis or more precisely the churchturing thesis is the view that a function f is effectively computable if and only if f is turingcomputable ie some turing machine can compute f thus this thesis has nothing to say about information processing that is more demanding than what a turing machine can achieve put another way there is no counterexample to ctt to be automatically found in an informationprocessing device capable of feats beyond the reach of tms for all philosophy and psychology know intelligence even if tied to information processing exceeds what is turingcomputational or turingmechanical38 this is especially true because philosophy and psychology unlike ai are in no way fundamentally charged with engineering artifacts which makes the physical realizability of hypercomputation irrelevant from their perspectives therefore contra dennett to consider ai as psychology or philosophy is to commit a serious error precisely because so doing would box these fields into only a speck of the entire space of functions from the natural numbers including tuples therefrom to the natural numbers only a tiny portion of the functions in this space are turingcomputable ai is without question much much narrower than this pair of fields of course it’s possible that ai could be replaced by a field devoted not to building computational artifacts by writing computer programs and running them on embodied turing machines but this new field by definition would not be ai our exploration of aima and other textbooks provide direct empirical confirmation of thisthird most ai researchers and developers in point of fact are simply concerned with building useful profitable artifacts and don’t spend much time reflecting upon the kinds of abstract definitions of intelligence explored in this entry eg what exactly is aithough ai isn’t philosophy there are certainly ways of doing real implementationfocussed ai of the highest caliber that are intimately bound up with philosophy the best way to demonstrate this is to simply present such research and development or at least a representative example thereof while there have been many examples of such work the most prominent example in ai is john pollock’s oscar project which stretched over a considerable portion of his lifetime for a detailed presentation and further discussion see thesupplement on the oscar projectit’s important to note at this juncture that the oscar project and the information processing that underlies it are without question at once philosophy and technical ai given that the work in question has appeared in the pages of artificial intelligence a firstrank journal devoted to that field and not to philosophy this is undeniable see eg pollock 2001 1992 this point is important because while it’s certainly appropriate in the present venue to emphasize connections between ai and philosophy some readers may suspect that this emphasis is contrived they may suspect that the truth of the matter is that page after page of ai journals are filled with narrow technical content far from philosophy many such papers do exist but we must distinguish between writings designed to present the nature of ai and its core methods and goals versus writings designed to present progress on specific technical issueswritings in the latter category are more often than not quite narrow but as the example of pollock shows sometimes these specific issues are inextricably linked to philosophy and of course pollock’s work is a representative example albeit the most substantive one one could just as easily have selected work by folks who don’t happen to also produce straight philosophy for example for an entire book written within the confines of ai and computer science but which is epistemic logic in action in many ways suitable for use in seminars on that topic see fagin et al 2004 it is hard to find technical work that isn’t bound up with philosophy in some direct way eg ai research on learning is all intimately bound up with philosophical treatments of induction of how genuinely new concepts not simply defined in terms of prior ones can be learned one possible partial answer offered by ai is inductive logic programming discussed in chapter 19 of aimawhat of writings in the former category writings in this category while by definition in ai venues not philosophy ones are nonetheless philosophical most textbooks include plenty of material that falls into this latter category and hence they include discussion of the philosophical nature of ai eg that ai is aimed at building artificial intelligences and that’s why after all it’s called ‘ai’recall that we earlier discussed proposed definitions of ai and recall specifically that these proposals were couched in terms of the goals of the field we can follow this pattern here we can distinguish between “strong” and “weak” ai by taking note of the different goals that these two versions of ai strive to reach “strong” ai seeks to create artificial persons machines that have all the mental powers we have including phenomenal consciousness “weak” ai on the other hand seeks to build informationprocessing machines that appear to have the full mental repertoire of human persons searle 1997 “weak” ai can also be defined as the form of ai that aims at a system able to pass not just the turing test again abbreviated as tt but the total turing test harnad 1991 in ttt a machine must muster more than linguistic indistinguishability it must pass for a human in all behaviors – throwing a baseball eating teaching a class etcit would certainly seem to be exceedingly difficult for philosophers to overthrow “weak” ai bringsjord and xiao 2000 after all what philosophical reason stands in the way of ai producing artifacts that appear to be animals or even humans however some philosophers have aimed to do in “strong” ai and we turn now to the most prominent case in pointwithout question the most famous argument in the philosophy of ai is john searle’s 1980 chinese room argument cra designed to overthrow “strong” ai we present a quick summary here and a “report from the trenches” as to how ai practitioners regard the argument readers wanting to further study cra will find an excellent next step in the entry on the chinese room argument and bishop preston 2002cra is based on a thoughtexperiment in which searle himself stars he is inside a room outside the room are native chinese speakers who don’t know that searle is inside it searleinthebox like searleinreallife doesn’t know any chinese but is fluent in english the chinese speakers send cards into the room through a slot on these cards are written questions in chinese the box courtesy of searle’s secret work therein returns cards to the native chinese speakers as output searle’s output is produced by consulting a rulebook this book is a lookup table that tells him what chinese to produce based on what is sent in to searle the chinese is all just a bunch of – to use searle’s language – squigglesquoggles the following schematic picture sums up the situation the labels should be obvious o denotes the outside observers in this case the chinese speakers input is denoted by i and output by o as you can see there is an icon for the rulebook and searle himself is denoted by pthe chinese room schematic viewnow what is the argument based on this thoughtexperiment even if you’ve never heard of cra before you doubtless can see the basic idea that searle in the box is supposed to be everything a computer can be and because he doesn’t understand chinese no computer could have such understanding searle is mindlessly moving squigglesquoggles around and according to the argument that’s all computers do fundamentally39where does cra stand today as we’ve already indicated the argument would still seem to be alive and well witness bishop preston 2002 however there is little doubt that at least among ai practitioners cra is generally rejected this is of course thoroughly unsurprising among these practitioners the philosopher who has offered the most formidable response out of ai itself is rapaport 1988 who argues that while ai systems are indeed syntactic the right syntax can constitute semantics it should be said that a common attitude among proponents of “strong” ai is that cra is not only unsound but silly based as it is on a fanciful story cr far removed from the practice of ai – practice which is year by year moving ineluctably toward sophisticated robots that will once and for all silence cra and its proponents for example john pollock as we’ve noted philosopher and practitioner of ai writesto wrap up discussion of cra we make two quick points to witreaders may wonder if there are philosophical debates that ai researchers engage in in the course of working in their field as opposed to when they might attend a philosophy conference surely ai researchers have philosophical discussions amongst themselves rightgenerally one finds that ai researchers do discuss among themselves topics in philosophy of ai and these topics are usually the very same ones that occupy philosophers of ai however the attitude reflected in the quote from pollock immediately above is by far the dominant one that is in general the attitude of ai researchers is that philosophizing is sometimes fun but the upward march of ai engineering cannot be stopped will not fail and will eventually render such philosophizing otiosewe will return to the issue of the future of ai in the final section of this entryfour decades ago jr lucas 1964 argued that gödel’s first incompleteness theorem entails that no machine can ever reach humanlevel intelligence his argument has not proved to be compelling but lucas initiated a debate that has produced more formidable arguments one of lucas’ indefatigable defenders is the physicist roger penrose whose first attempt to vindicate lucas was a gödelian attack on “strong” ai articulated in his the emperor’s new mind 1989 this first attempt fell short and penrose published a more elaborate and more fastidious gödelian case expressed in chapters 2 and 3 of his shadows of the mind 1994in light of the fact that readers can turn to the entry on the gödel’s incompleteness theorems a full review here is not needed instead readers will be given a decent sense of the argument by turning to an online paper in which penrose writing in response to critics eg the philosopher david chalmers the logician solomon feferman and the computer scientist drew mcdermott of his shadows of the mind distills the argument to a couple of paragraphs40 indeed in this paper penrose gives what he takes to be the perfected version of the core gödelian case given in sotm here is this version verbatimdoes this argument succeed a firm answer to this question is not appropriate to seek in the present entry interested readers are encouraged to consult four fullscale treatments of the argument hayes et al 1998 bringsjord and xiao 2000 shapiro 2003 bowie 1982in addition to the gödelian and searlean arguments covered briefly above a third attack on “strong” ai of the symbolic variety has been widely discussed though with the rise of statistical machine learning has come a corresponding decrease in the attention paid to it namely one given by the philosopher hubert dreyfus 1972 1992 some incarnations of which have been coarticulated with his brother stuart dreyfus 1987 a computer scientist put crudely the core idea in this attack is that human expertise is not based on the explicit disembodied mechanical manipulation of symbolic information such as formulae in some logic or probabilities in some bayesian network and that ai’s efforts to build machines with such expertise are doomed if based on the symbolic paradigm the genesis of the dreyfusian attack was a belief that the critique of if you will symbolbased philosophy eg philosophy in the logicbased rationalist tradition as opposed to what is called the continental tradition from such thinkers as heidegger and merleauponty could be made against the rationalist tradition in ai after further reading and study of dreyfus’ writings readers may judge whether this critique is compelling in an informationdriven world increasingly managed by intelligent agents that carry out symbolic reasoning albeit not even close to the human levelfor readers interested in exploring philosophy of ai beyond what jim moor in a recent address – “the next fifty years of ai future scientific research vs past philosophical criticisms” – as the 2006 barwise award winner at the annual eastern american philosophical association meeting has called the “the big three” criticisms of ai there is no shortage of additional material much of it available on the web the last chapter of aima provides a compressed overview of some additional arguments against “strong” ai and is in general not a bad next step needless to say philosophy of ai today involves much more than the three wellknown arguments discussed above and inevitably philosophy of ai tomorrow will include new debates and problems we can’t see now because machines inevitably will get smarter and smarter regardless of just how smart they get philosophy of ai pure and simple is a growth industry with every human activity that machines match the “big” questions will only attract more attentionif past predictions are any indication the only thing we know today about tomorrow’s science and technology is that it will be radically different than whatever we predict it will be like arguably in the case of ai we may also specifically know today that progress will be much slower than what most expect after all at the 1956 kickoff conference discussed at the start of this entry herb simon predicted that thinking machines able to match the human mind were “just around the corner” for the relevant quotes and informative discussion see the first chapter of aima as it turned out the new century would arrive without a single machine able to converse at even the toddler level recall that when it comes to the building of machines capable of displaying humanlevel intelligence descartes not turing seems today to be the better prophet nonetheless astonishing though it may be serious thinkers in the late 20th century have continued to issue incredibly optimistic predictions regarding the progress of ai for example hans moravec 1999 in his robot mere machine to transcendent mind informs us that because the speed of computer hardware doubles every 18 months in accordance with moore’s law which has apparently held in the past “fourth generation” robots will soon enough exceed humans in all respects from running companies to writing novels these robots so the story goes will evolve to such lofty cognitive heights that we will stand to them as singlecell organisms stand to us today41moravec is by no means singularly pollyannaish many others in ai predict the same sensational future unfolding on about the same rapid schedule in fact at the aforementioned ai50 conference jim moor posed the question “will humanlevel ai be achieved within the next 50 years” to five thinkers who attended the original 1956 conference john mccarthy marvin minsky oliver selfridge ray solomonoff and trenchard moore mccarthy and minsky gave firm unhesitating affirmatives and solomonoff seemed to suggest that ai provided the one ray of hope in the face of fact that our species seems bent on destroying itself selfridge’s reply was a bit cryptic moore returned a firm unambiguous negative and declared that once his computer is smart enough to interact with him conversationally about mathematical problems he might take this whole enterprise more seriously it is left to the reader to judge the accuracy of such risky predictions as have been given by moravec mccarthy and minsky42the judgment of the reader in this regard ought to factor in the stunning resurgence very recently of serious reflection on what is known as “the singularity” denoted by us simply as s the future point at which artificial intelligence exceeds human intelligence whereupon immediately thereafter as the story goes the machines make themselves rapidly smarter and smarter and smarter reaching a superhuman level of intelligence that stuck as we are in the mud of our limited mentation we can’t fathom for extensive balanced analysis of s see eden et al 2013readers unfamiliar with the literature on s may be quite surprised to learn the degree to which among learned folks this hypothetical event is not only taken seriously but has in fact become a target for extensive and frequent philosophizing for a mordant tour of the recent thought in question see floridi 2015 what arguments support the belief that s is in our future there are two main arguments at this point the familiar hardwarebased one championed by moravec as noted above and again more recently by kurzweil 2006 and the – as far as we know – original argument given by mathematician i j good 1965 in addition there is a recent and related doomsayer argument advanced by bostrom 2014 which seems to presuppose that s will occur good’s argument nicely amplified and adjusted by chalmers 2010 who affirms the tidiedup version of the argument runs as followsin this argument ‘ai’ is artificial intelligence at the level of and created by human persons ‘ai’ artificial intelligence above the level of human persons and ‘ai’ superintelligence constitutive of s the key process is presumably the creation of one class of machine by another we have added for convenience ‘hi’ for human intelligence the central idea is then hi will create ai the latter at the same level of intelligence as the former ai will create ai ai will create ai with the ascension proceeding perhaps forever but at any rate proceeding long enough for us to be as ants outstripped by godsthe argument certainly appears to be formally valid are its three premises true taking up such a question would fling us far beyond the scope of this entry we point out only that the concept of one class of machines creating another more powerful class of machines is not a transparent one and neither good nor chalmers provides a rigorous account of the concept which is ripe for philosophical analysis as to mathematical analysis some exists of course it is for example wellknown that a computing machine at level l cannot possibly create another machine at a higher level l for instance a linearbounded automaton can’t create a turing machinethe goodchalmers argument has a rather clinical air about it the argument doesn’t say anything regarding whether machines in the ai category will be benign malicious or munificent many others gladly fill this gap with dark dark pessimism the locus classicus here is without question a widely read paper by bill joy 2000 “why the future doesn’t need us” joy believes that the human race is doomed in no small part because it’s busy building smart machines he writesthe 21stcentury technologies – genetics nanotechnology and robotics gnr – are so powerful that they can spawn whole new classes of accidents and abuses most dangerously for the first time these accidents and abuses are widely within the reach of individuals or small groups they will not require large facilities or rare raw materials knowledge alone will enable the use of themthus we have the possibility not just of weapons of mass destruction but of knowledgeenabled mass destruction kmd this destructiveness hugely amplified by the power of selfreplicationi think it is no exaggeration to say we are on the cusp of the further perfection of extreme evil an evil whose possibility spreads well beyond that which weapons of mass destruction bequeathed to the nationstates on to a surprising and terrible empowerment of extreme individuals43philosophers would be most interested in arguments for this view what are joy’s well no small reason for the attention lavished on his paper is that like raymond kurzweil 2000 joy relies heavily on an argument given by none other than the unabomber theodore kaczynski the idea is that assuming we succeed in building intelligent machines we will have them do most if not all work for us if we further allow the machines to make decisions for us – even if we retain oversight over the machines – we will eventually depend on them to the point where we must simply accept their decisions but even if we don’t allow the machines to make decisions the control of such machines is likely to be held by a small elite who will view the rest of humanity as unnecessary – since the machines can do any needed work joy 2000this isn’t the place to assess this argument having said that the pattern pushed by the unabomber and his supporters certainly appears to be flatly invalid44 in fact many readers will doubtless feel that no such place exists or will exist because the reasoning here is amateurish so then what about the reasoning of professional philosophers on the matterbostrom has recently painted an exceedingly dark picture of a possible future he points out that the “first superintelligence” could have the capabilityclearly the most vulnerable premise in this sort of argument is that the “first superintelligence” will arrive indeed arrive here perhaps the goodchalmers argument provides a basissearle 2014 thinks bostrom’s book is misguided and fundamentally mistaken and that we needn’t worry his rationale is dirtsimple machines aren’t conscious bostrom is alarmed at the prospect of malicious machines who do us in a malicious machine is by definition a conscious machine ergo bostrom’s argument doesn’t work searle writesthe positively remarkable thing here it seems to us is that searle appears to be unaware of the brute fact that most ai engineers are perfectly content to build machines on the basis of the aima view of ai we presented and explained above the view according to which machines simply map percepts to actions on this view it doesn’t matter whether the machine really has desires what matters is whether it acts suitably on the basis of how ai scientists engineer formal correlates to desire an autonomous machine with overwhelming destructive power that nonconsciously “decides” to kill doesn’t become just a nuisance because genuine humanlevel subjective desire is absent from the machine if an ai can play the game of chess and the game of jeopardy it can certainly play the game of war just as it does little good for a human loser to point out that the victorious machine in a game of chess isn’t conscious it will do little good for humans being killed by machines to point out that these machines aren’t conscious it is interesting to note that the genesis of joy’s paper was an informal conversation with john searle and raymond kurzweil according to joy searle didn’t think there was much to worry about since he was and is quite confident that tomorrow’s robots can’t be conscious45there are some things we can safely say about tomorrow certainly barring some cataclysmic events nuclear or biological warfare global economic depression a meteorite smashing into earth etc we now know that ai will succeed in producing artificial animals since even some natural animals mules eg can be easily trained to work for humans it stands to reason that artificial animals designed from scratch with our purposes in mind will be deployed to work for us in fact many jobs currently done by humans will certainly be done by appropriately programmed artificial animals to pick an arbitrary example it is difficult to believe that commercial drivers won’t be artificial in the future indeed daimler is already running commercials in which they tout the ability of their automobiles to drive “autonomously” allowing human occupants of these vehicles to ignore the road and read other examples would include cleaners mail carriers clerical workers military scouts surgeons and pilots as to cleaners probably a significant number of readers at this very moment have robots from irobot cleaning the carpets in their homes it is hard to see how such jobs are inseparably bound up with the attributes often taken to be at the core of personhood – attributes that would be the most difficult for ai to replicate46andy clark 2003 has another prediction humans will gradually become at least to an appreciable degree cyborgs courtesy of artificial limbs and sense organs and implants the main driver of this trend will be that while standalone ais are often desirable they are hard to engineer when the desired level of intelligence is high but to let humans “pilot” less intelligent machines is a good deal easier and still very attractive for concrete reasons another related prediction is that ai would play the role of a cognitive prosthesis for humans ford et al 1997 hoffman et al 2001 the prosthesis view sees ai as a “great equalizer” that would lead to less stratification in society perhaps similar to how the hinduarabic numeral system made arithmetic available to the masses and to how the guttenberg press contributed to literacy becoming more universaleven if the argument is formally invalid it leaves us with a question – the cornerstone question about ai and the future will ai produce artificial creatures that replicate and exceed human cognition as kurzweil and joy believe or is this merely an interesting suppositionthis is a question not just for scientists and engineers it is also a question for philosophers this is so for two reasons one research and development designed to validate an affirmative answer must include philosophy – for reasons rooted in earlier parts of the present entry eg philosophy is the place to turn to for robust formalisms to model human propositional attitudes in machine terms two philosophers might well be able to provide arguments that answer the cornerstone question now definitively if a version of either of the three arguments against “strong” ai alluded to above searle’s cra the gödelian attack the dreyfus argument are sound then of course ai will not manage to produce machines having the mental powers of persons no doubt the future holds not only eversmarter machines but new arguments pro and con on the question of whether this progress can reach the human level that descartes declared to be unreachableartificial intelligence logic and causation probabilistic chinese room argument cognitive science computability and

given in the form of a fixed set of input and output pairs for the function let hh be the “learned function” the goal of supervised learning is have hh match as closely as possible the true function

are possible for example in active learning the learning algorithm can request the value of the function for arbitrary inputs supervised learning dominates the field of machine learning and has been used in almost all practical applications mentioned just above unsupervised learning here the machine tries to find useful knowledge or information when given some raw data left x1x2 ldots xn right there is no function associated with the input that has to be learned the idea is that the machine helps uncover interesting patterns or information that could be hidden in the data one use of unsupervised learning is data mining where large volumes of data are searched for interesting information pagerank one of the earliest algorithms used by the google search engine can be considered to be an unsupervised learning system that ranks pages without any human supervision chapter 1410 hastie et al 2009 reinforcement learning here a machine is set loose in an environment where it constantly acts and perceives similar to the russellhutter view above and only occasionally receives feedback on its behavior in the form of rewards or punishments the machine has to learn to behave rationally from this feedback one use of reinforcement learning has been in building agents to play computer games the objective here is to build agents that map sensory data from the game at every time instant to an action that would help win in the game or maximize a human player’s enjoyment of the game in most games we know how well we are playing only at the end of the game or only at infrequent intervals throughout the game eg a chess game that we feel we are winning could quickly turn against us at the end in supervised learning the training data has ideal inputoutput pairs this form of learning is not suitable for building agents that have to operate across a length of time and are judged not on one action but a series of actions and their effects on the environment the field of reinforcement learning tries to tackle this problem through a variety of methods though a bit dated sutton and barto 1998 provide a comprehensive introduction to the fieldall probabilities fall between 0 and 1 ie forall p 0 leq pp leq 1 valid in the traditional logicist sense propositions have a probability of 1 unsatisfiable in the traditional logicist sense propositions have a probability of 0 pplor q pp pq ppland qdespite the confidence of the likes of pollock about the eventual irrelevance of cra in the face of the eventual humanlevel prowess of oscar and by extension any number of other stillimproving ai systems the brute fact is that deeply semantic naturallanguage processing nlp is rarely even pursued these days so proponents of cra are certainly not the ones feeling some discomfort in light of the current state of ai in short searle would rightly point to any of the success stories of ai including the watson system we have discussed and still proclaim that understanding is nowhere to be found – and he would be well within his philosophical rights in saying this it would appear that the cra is bubbling back to a level of engagement not seen for a number of years in light of the empirical fact that certain thinkers are now issuing explicit warnings to the effect that future conscious malevolent machines may well wish to do in our species in reply searle 2014 points out that since cra is sound there can’t be conscious machines and if there can’t be conscious machines there can’t be malevolent machines that wish anything we return to this at the end of our entry the chief point here is that cra continues to be quite relevant and indeed we suspect that searle’s basis for havenofear will be taken up energetically by not only philosophers but ai experts futurists lawyers and policymakersartificial intelligence principles and techniques from stanford aritifical intelligence online course from udacity artificial intelligence from

community rules please read the rules before joining the discussionalmost 20 years ago the medical and scientific communities were overjoyed with the human genome project finished there was an air of inevitability that the causes of some of the most common and destructive diseases would soon be pinpointed and eradicated it’d be simple one gene one problem one solution we even heard francis collins at the time say “over the longer term perhaps in another 15 or 20 years you will see a complete transformation in therapeutic medicine” unfortunately it was never going to be that easyas a result of the human genome project we do have a much clearer picture of what lives inside of us and why but the other side of that coin is that as a result we also know disease rarely ever follows tidy rules like a single gene as the root problem multiple genes play multiple roles and a quick targeted solution is most often not possible even for conditions identified as being caused by a single gene like huntington’s disease we’re still working on a first treatment much less the beall endall solutionfrancis collins director of the human genome project of the national institutes of health announces the

make huge strides in disease treatment using it we will be able to map the root causes of disease then run simulations to determine the exact treatments we need to slow and stop them with just a little more time our use of ai will solve some of the most treacherous illnesses we facesound familiarthe truth is there is a lot of promise in ai the limitation of many human genome projectguided solutions was that each problem was tackled looking for one or two sources virtually by hand using the “maps” artificial intelligence can do that pathfinding at an exponential rateand while the human genome project developed a look at our bodies in totality the humans tasked with working with this data are physically unable to factor in the complexity of the human conditions programs equipped with ai have the benefit of considering data from entire populations when working on our genome quickly recognizing patterns and outliers that might have taken us years to root out — if we ever didbut it might be time to temper our expectations the reality is ai isn’t exactly new it’s been a part of medicine to varying degrees since the 1970s even before the human genome project was tackled and ai has been wrestling with the data from that project and its derivatives for decades now with limited success if we’re being honest with ourselves there’s a chance that the best we can ever do is create a more accurate map of our risks for disease using measures of family historyclearly ai has opened doors to a lot of new and exciting things learning from the past if we can just meter our excitement and allow for this technology to be developed at a reasonable pace with realistic goals it’s possible that we could reach some of the heights we’d always hoped we need to realize once again that

ai is going to play in shaping our future while we might think that ai is at least a few years away from causing any considerable effects on our lives the fact remains that it is already having an enormous impact on us artificial intelligence is affecting our decisions and our lifestyles every day don’t believe me well read along as we tell you 10 examples of artificial intelligence you are using in your daily life examples of artificial intelligence 1 smartphones adsbygoogle windowadsbygoogle push if you are reading this article you most probably own a smartphone heck if i have to make a guess i would say that most of you guys are reading this article on a smartphone smartphones have become the most indispensable tech product that we own today and we use it almost all the time well if you are using a smartphone you are interacting with ai whether you know it or not from the obvious ai features such as the builtin smart assistants to not so obvious ones such as the portrait mode in the camera ai is impacting our lives every day in fact the two examples that i provided above give us a glimpse into the world of ai and how it is effecting our lives firstly there are the obvious ai elements which most of us have some knowledge about for example when you are using a smart assistant whether it’s google assistant alexa siri or bixby you more or less know that these assistants are based on ai however when we are using a feature such as the portrait mode effect while shooting a picture we never consider that ai might be behind that too have you ever thought how google pixel 2 can capture such great portrait shots with just a single lens the answer is artificial intelligence now more and more manufacturers are including ai in their smartphones with big chip manufacturers including qualcomm and huawei producing chips with builtin ai capabilities the ai integration is helping in bringing features like scene detection mixed and virtual reality elements and more ai is going to play an even major role in the coming years we are already seeing the huge emphasis on ai with the latest android and ios updates features like app actions splices and adaptive battery in android pie and siri shortcut and siri suggestions in ios 12 are made possible with ai so next time if you think ai is not effecting you take out your smartphone 2 smart cars and drones talking about the ai there is no better and more prominent display of this technology than what smart car and drone manufacturers are doing with it just a few years back using a fully automatic car was a dream however now companies like tesla have made so much progress that we already have a fleet of semiautomatic cars on the road companies like amazon and walmart are heavily investing in drone delivery programs and it will become a reality far sooner than what you expect if you think that’s farfetched do note that militaries all over the world are already using successful drone programs adsbygoogle windowadsbygoogle push tesla cars are a prime example of how the ai is impacting our daily life did you know that all the tesla cars are connected and the things that your car learns is shared across all the cars that means if you had to take an unanticipated hardleft on a crossroad all the tesla cars will know how to maneuver that turn after they are updated there are already more than 50000 tesla cars running in the us alone and that number is set to increase exponentially now that tesla has solved its major production problems with autonomous cars running on our roads and autonomous drones flying above us you won’t be able to deny the impact of ai on our lives 3 social media feeds if you are thinking that smart cars don’t personally effect you as they are still not in your country or city well how about something which you use on a daily basis even if you are living under a rock there’s a high probability that you are tweeting from underneath it if twitter’s not your choice of poison maybe it’s facebook or instagram or snapchat or any of the myriad of social media apps out there well if you are using social media most of your decisions are being impacted by artificial intelligence from the feeds that you see in your timeline to the notifications that you receive from these apps everything is curated by ai ai takes all your past behavior web searches interactions and everything else that you do when you are on these websites and tailors the experience just for you the sole purpose of ai here is to make the apps so addictive that you come back to them again and again and i am ready to place a bet that ai is winning this war against you 4 music and media streaming services another great example of how ai impacts our lives are the music and media streaming services that we are using on a daily basis whether you are using spotify netflix or youtube ai is making the decisions for you you might feel that you are in total control but you are not and as it is with everything sometimes its good and sometimes it bad for example i love the discover weekly playlist on spotify as it has introduced me to several new artists which i wouldn’t have been introduced to if not for the ai gods at spotify on the other hand i also remember going down the youtube rabbit hole wasting countless hours just watching the recommended videos that recommended videos section has become so good at knowing my taste that it’s scary so next time you are hitting play on a recommended video on youtube or watching a recommended show on netflix or listening to a precreated playlist on spotify or any other media and music streaming service for that matter remember that ai is playing a big role in that 5 video games the video game industry is probably one of the earliest adopters of ai the integration started very small with the use of ai to generate random levels that people can play however that has increased to a level which goes far beyond what one can even imagine on the large scale we just observed openai 5 developed by the company openai which is being backed by elon musk beating prolevel dota 2 players in one on one matches while also beating amateur dota 2 teams this achievement is being hailed as a leapfrogging moment in the ai industry dota 2 is a strategy based game where players have to make decisions every second and beating pro players in such a dynamic game is a huge achievement for ai adsbygoogle windowadsbygoogle push keeping the dota 2 win aside for a while let’s talk about how ai is infiltrating our normal gaming industry any game that you play has some sort of ai element to it when you are playing a game such as cs go pubg or fortnite you essentially start against a couple of aipowered bots and then move to play against real players even when you are playing a single person story mode game you are playing against ai bosses if you are playing racing games you are racing against ai bots probably the most interesting use of ai we have seen in games is in the middle earth series of games where your enemies which are controlled by ai evolve based on their interaction with you and other gaming elements i can go on and on about the use of ai in games but that would make this article very long just know that if you play any game you are using ai 6 online ads network one of the biggest users of artificial intelligence is the online ad industry which uses ai to not only track user statistics but also serve us ads based on those statistics without ai the online ad industry will just fail as it would show random ads to users with no connection to their preferences what so ever ai has become so successful in determining our interests and serving us ads that the global digital ad industry has crossed 250 billion us dollars with the industry projected to cross the 300 billion mark in 2019 so next time when you are going online and seeing ads or product recommendation know that ai is impacting your life 7 navigation and travel by now you must be convinced of the fact that ai is impacting our lives on a daily basis however if there are still some skeptics out there let us take a few more example how about the navigation and travel industry i mean most of us travel from time to time and use the navigation on almost a daily basis do you know that whether you are using google or apple maps for navigating or calling an uber or booking a flight ticket you are using ai well if you didn’t know that before it’s time that you open your eyes both google and apple along with other navigation services use artificial intelligence to interpret hundreds of thousands of data point that they receive to give you realtime traffic data when you are calling an uber both the pricing and the car that matches your ride request is decided by ai as you can see ai plays a significant role in how we reach from point a to point b 8 banking and finance the banking and finance industry plays a major role in our lives i mean the world runs on money and banks are essentially the gatekeepers that regulate that flow did you know that the banking and finance industry heavily relies on artificial intelligence for things like customer service fraud protection investment and more a simple example is the automated emails that you receive from banks whenever you do an out of the ordinary transaction well that’s ai watching over your account and trying to warn you of any fraud ai is also being trained to look at large samples of fraud data and find a pattern so that you can be warned before it happens to you also when you hitch a little snag and chat with bank’s customer service chances are that you are chatting with an ai bot even the big players in the finance industry use ai to analyze data to find the best avenues to invest money so they can get the most returns with the least risk that’s not all ai is poised to play an even bigger role in the industry as major banks across the world are investing billions of dollars in the ai technology and we all will observe its effects sooner than later 9 smart home devices we are even willingly letting artificial intelligence in our houses many of the smart home devices that we buy use artificial intelligence to learn our behavior so that they can adjust the settings themselves to make the experience as frictionless as possible for us we have already talked about smart voice assistants which we use to control these smart home devices and as we know they are the prime example of ai impacting our lives adsbygoogle windowadsbygoogle push i will agree that a perfect aipowered house which reacts to our choices in reallives is still a decade or so away however we are seeing the steps that will take us there i mean there are smart thermostats which adjust the temperature based on your preferences smart lights that change the color and intensity of lights based on time and much more it won’t be long when our main interactions with all our smart home devices will be through ai only 10 security and surveillance while we can all debate the ethics of using a broad surveillance system there’s no denying the fact that it is being used and ai is playing a big part in that it is not possible for humans to keep monitoring multiple monitors with feeds from hundreds if not thousands of cameras at the same time and hence using ai makes perfect sense with technologies like object recognition and facial recognition getting better and better every day it won’t be long when all the security camera feeds are being monitored by an ai and not a human while there’s still time before ai can be fully implemented this is going to be our future see also 12 best google home accessories you can buy artificial intelligence the present and the future as you can see all of our lives are impacted by artificial intelligence on a daily basis whether we are using our smartphones surfing the internet buying products online using navigation wasting time on social media or listening to songs on our favorite music streaming service ai is impacting our choices in one way or another do let us know how you feel about ai impacting our lives by writing in the comments section below adsbygoogle windowadsbygoogle pushif you are reading this article you most probably own a smartphone heck if i have to make a guess i would say that most of you guys are reading this article on a smartphone smartphones have become the most indispensable tech product that we own today and we use it almost all the time

the ethics of using a broad surveillance system there’s no denying the fact that it is being used and ai is playing a big part in that it is not possible for humans to keep monitoring multiple

our future see also 12 best google home accessories you can buy artificial intelligence the present and the future as you can see all of our lives are impacted by artificial intelligence on a daily basis whether we are using our smartphones surfing the internet buying products online using navigation wasting time on social media or listening to songs on our favorite music streaming service ai is impacting our choices in one way or another do let us know how you feel about ai impacting our lives by writing in the comments section below adsbygoogle windowadsbygoogle pushnow more and more manufacturers are including ai in their smartphones with big chip manufacturers including qualcomm and huawei producing chips with builtin ai capabilities the ai integration is helping in bringing features like scene detection mixed and virtual reality elements and more ai is going to play an even major role in the coming years we are already seeing the huge emphasis on ai with the latest android and ios updates features like app actions splices and adaptive battery in android pie and siri shortcut and siri suggestions in ios 12 are made possible with ai so next time if you think ai is not effecting you take out your smartphone 2 smart cars and drones talking about the ai there is no better and more prominent display of this technology than what smart car and drone manufacturers are doing with it just a few years back using a fully automatic car was a dream however now companies like tesla have made so much progress that we already have a fleet of semiautomatic cars on the road companies like amazon and walmart are heavily investing in drone delivery programs and it will become a reality far sooner than what you expect if you think that’s farfetched do note that militaries all over the world are already using successful drone programs adsbygoogle windowadsbygoogle push tesla cars are a prime example of how the ai is impacting our daily life did you know that all the tesla cars are connected and the things that your car learns is shared across all the cars that means if you had to take an unanticipated hardleft on a crossroad all the tesla cars will know how to maneuver that turn after they are updated there are already more than 50000 tesla cars running in the us alone and that number is set to increase exponentially now that tesla has solved its major production problems with autonomous cars running on our roads and autonomous drones flying above us you won’t be able to deny the impact of ai on our lives 3 social media feeds if you are thinking that smart cars don’t personally effect you as they are still not in your country or city well how about something which you use on a daily basis even if you are living under a rock there’s a high probability that you are tweeting from underneath it if twitter’s not your choice of poison maybe it’s facebook or instagram or snapchat or any of the myriad of social media apps out there well if you are using social media most of your decisions are being impacted by artificial intelligence from the feeds that you see in your timeline to the notifications that you receive from these apps everything is curated by ai ai takes all your past behavior web searches interactions and everything else that you do when you are on these websites and tailors the experience just for you the sole purpose of ai here is to make the apps so addictive that you come back to them again and again and i am ready to place a bet that ai is winning this war against you 4 music and media streaming services another great example of how ai impacts our lives are the music and media streaming services that we are using on a daily basis whether you are using spotify netflix or youtube ai is making the decisions for you you might feel that you are in total control but you are not and as it is with everything sometimes its good and sometimes it bad for example i love the discover weekly playlist on spotify as it has introduced me to several new artists which i wouldn’t have been introduced to if not for the ai gods at spotify on the other hand i also remember going down the youtube rabbit hole wasting countless hours just watching the recommended videos that recommended videos section has become so good at knowing my taste that it’s scary so next time you are hitting play on a recommended video on youtube or watching a recommended show on netflix or listening to a precreated playlist on spotify or any other media and music streaming service for that matter remember that ai is playing a big role in that 5 video games the video game industry is probably one of the earliest adopters of ai the integration started very small with the use of ai to generate random levels that people can play however that has increased to a level which goes far beyond what one can even imagine on the large scale we just observed openai 5 developed by the company openai which is being backed by elon musk beating prolevel dota 2 players in one on one matches while also beating amateur dota 2 teams this achievement is being hailed as a leapfrogging moment in the ai industry dota 2 is a strategy based game where players have to make decisions every second and beating pro players in such a dynamic game is a huge achievement for ai adsbygoogle windowadsbygoogle push keeping the dota 2 win aside for a while let’s talk about how ai is infiltrating our normal gaming industry any game that you play has some sort of ai element to it when you are playing a game such as cs go pubg or fortnite you essentially start against a couple of aipowered bots and then move to play against real players even when you are playing a single person story mode game you are playing against ai bosses if you are playing racing games you are racing against ai bots probably the most interesting use of ai we have seen in games is in the middle earth series of games where your enemies which are

to look at large samples of fraud data and find a pattern so that you can be warned before it happens to you also when you hitch a little snag and chat with bank’s customer service chances are that you are chatting with an ai bot even the big players in the finance industry use ai to analyze data to find the best avenues to invest money so they can get the most returns with the least risk that’s

on spotify as it has introduced me to several new artists which i wouldn’t have been introduced to if not for the ai gods at spotify on the other hand i also remember going down the youtube rabbit hole wasting countless hours just watching the recommended videos that recommended videos section has become so good at knowing my taste that it’s scary so next time you are hitting play on a recommended video on youtube or watching a recommended show on netflix or listening to a precreated playlist on spotify or any other media and music streaming service for that matter remember that ai

'p': 'when most people think of artificial intelligence ai they think of hal 9000 from 2001 a space odyssey data from star trek or more recently the android ava from ex machina but to a computer scientist that isnt what ai necessarily is and the question what is ai can be a complicated oneone of the standard textbooks in the field by university of california computer scientists stuart russell and googles director of research peter norvig puts artificial intelligence in to four broad categoriesthe differences between them can be subtle notes ernest davis a professor of computer science at new york university alphago the computer program that beat a world champion at go acts rationally when it plays the game it plays to win but it doesnt necessarily think the way a human being does though it engages in some of the same patternrecognition tasks similarly a machine that acts like a human doesnt necessarily bear much resemblance to people in the way it processes informationeven ibms watson which acted somewhat like a human when playing jeopardy wasnt using anything like the rational processes humans usedavis says he uses another definition centered on what one wants a computer to do there are a number of cognitive tasks that people do easily — often indeed with no conscious thought at all — but that are extremely hard to program on computers archetypal examples are vision and natural language understanding artificial intelligence as i define it is the study of getting computers to carry out these tasks he saidcomputer vision has made a lot of strides in the past decade — cameras can now recognize faces in the frame and tell the user where they are however computers are still not that good at actually recognizing faces and the way they do it is different from the way people do a google image search for instance just looks for images in which the pattern of pixels matches the reference image more sophisticated face recognition systems look at the dimensions of the face to match them with images that might not be simple faceon photos humans process the information rather differently and exactly how that process works is still something of an open question for neuroscientists and cognitive scientistsother tasks though are proving tougher for example davis and nyu psychology professor gary marcus wrote in the communications of the association for computing machinery of common sense tasks that computers find very difficult a robot serving drinks for example can be programmed to recognize a request for one and even to manipulate a glass and pour one but if a fly lands in the glass the computer still has a tough time deciding whether to pour the drink in and serve it or notthe issue is that much of common sense is very hard to model computer scientists have taken several approaches to get around that problem ibms watson for instance was able to do so well on jeopardy because it had a huge database of knowledge to work with and a few rules to string words together to make questions and answers watson though would have a difficult time with a simple openended conversationbeyond tasks though is the issue of learning machines can learn said kathleen mckeown a professor of computer science at columbia university machine learning is a kind of ai she saidsome machine learning works in a way similar to the way people do it she noted google translate for example uses a large corpus of text in a given language to translate to another language a statistical process that doesnt involve looking for the meaning of words humans she said do something similar in that we learn languages by seeing lots of examplesthat said google translate doesnt always get it right precisely because it doesnt seek meaning and can sometimes be fooled by synonyms or differing connotationsone area that mckeown said is making rapid strides is summarizing texts systems to do that are sometimes employed by law firms that have to go through a lot of itmckeown also thinks personal assistants is an area likely to move forward quickly i would look at the movie her she said in that 2013 movie starring joaquin phoenix a man falls in love with an operating system that has consciousnessi initially didnt want to go see it i said thats totally ridiculous mckeown said but i actually enjoyed it people are building these conversational assistants and trying to see how far can we getthe upshot is ais that can handle certain tasks well exist as do ais that look almost human because they have a large trove of data to work with computer scientists have been less successful coming up with an ai that can think the way we expect a human being to or to act like a human in more than very limited situationsi dont think were in a state that ai is so good that it will do things we hadnt imagined it was going to do mckeown saidadditional resourcescopyright © documentwritenew dategetfullyear all rights reserved', 'ul': 'news tech health planet earth

exponentially humans have developed the power of computer systems in terms of their diverse working domains their increasing speed and reducing size with respect to timea branch of computer science named artificial intelligence pursues creating the computers or machines as intelligent as human beingsaccording to the father of artificial intelligence john mccarthy it is “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines especially intelligent computer programs”artificial intelligence is a way of making a computer a computercontrolled robot or a software think intelligently in the similar manner the intelligent humans thinkai is accomplished by studying how human brain thinks and how humans learn decide and work while trying to solve a problem and then using the outcomes of this study as a basis of developing intelligent software and systemswhile exploiting the power of the computer systems the curiosity of human lead him to wonder “can a machine think and behave like

patients demand more from their providers and the volume of available data continues to increase at a staggering rate artificial intelligence is poised to be the engine that drives improvements across the care continuumai offers a number of advantages over traditional analytics and clinical decisionmaking techniques learning algorithms can become more precise and accurate as they interact with training data allowing humans to gain unprecedented insights into diagnostics care processes treatment variability and patient outcomesat the 2018 world medical innovation forum wmif on artificial intelligence presented by partners healthcare a leading researchers and clinical faculty members showcased the twelve technologies and areas of the healthcare industry that are most likely to see a major impact from artificial intelligence within the next decadeevery member of this “disruptive dozen” has the potential to produce a significant benefit to patients while possessing the potential for broad commercial success said wmif cochairs anne kiblanksi md chief academic officer at partners healthcare and gregg meyer md chief clinical officerwith the help of experts from across the partners healthcare system including faculty from harvard medical school hms moderators keith dreyer do phd chief data science officer at partners and katherine andriole phd director of research strategy and operations at massachusetts general hospital mgh counted down the top 12 ways artificial intelligence will revolutionize the delivery and science of healthcareusing computers to communicate is not a new idea by any means but creating direct interfaces between technology and the human mind without the need for keyboards mice and monitors is a cuttingedge area of research that has significant applications for some patientsneurological diseases and trauma to the nervous system can take away some patients’ abilities to speak move and interact meaningfully with people and their environments braincomputer interfaces bcis backed by artificial intelligence could restore those fundamental experiences to those who feared them lost forever“if i’m in the neurology icu on a monday and i see someone who has suddenly lost the ability to move or to speak we want to restore that ability to communicate by tuesday” said leigh hochberg md phd director of the center for neurotechnology and neurorecovery at mgh“by using a bci and artificial intelligence we can decode the neural activates associated with the intended movement of one’s hand and we should be able to allow that person to communicate the same way as many people in this room have communicated at least five times over the course of the morning using a ubiquitous communication technology like a tablet computer or phone”braincomputer interfaces could drastically improve quality of life for patients with als strokes or lockedin syndrome as well as the 500000 people worldwide who experience spinal cord injuries every yearradiological images obtained by mri machines ct scanners and xrays offer noninvasive visibility into the inner workings of the human body but many diagnostic processes still rely on physical tissue samples obtained through biopsies which carry risks including the potential for infectionartificial intelligence will enable the next generation of radiology tools that are accurate and detailed enough to replace the need for tissue samples in some cases experts predictwe want to bring together the diagnostic imaging team with the surgeon or interventional radiologist and the pathologist” said alexandra golby md director of imageguided neurosurgery at brigham women’s hospital bwh “that coming together of different teams and aligning goals is a big challenge”“if we want the imaging to give us information that we presently get from tissue samples then we’re going to have to be able to achieve very close registration so that the ground truth for any given pixel is known”succeeding in this quest may allow clinicians to develop a more accurate understanding of how tumors behave as a whole instead of basing treatment decisions on the properties of a small segment of the malignancyproviders may also be able to better define the aggressiveness of cancers and target treatments more appropriatelyartificial intelligence is helping to enable “virtual biopsies” and advance the innovative field of radiomics which focuses on harnessing imagebased algorithms to characterize the phenotypes and genetic properties of tumorsshortages of trained healthcare providers including ultrasound technicians and radiologists can significantly limit access to lifesaving care in developing nations around the worldmore radiologists work in the halfdozen hospitals lining the renowned longwood avenue in boston than in all of west africa the session pointed outartificial intelligence could help mitigate the impacts of this severe deficit of qualified clinical staff by taking over some of the diagnostic duties typically allocated to humansfor example ai imaging tools can screen chest xrays for signs of tuberculosis often achieving a level of accuracy comparable to humans this capability could be deployed through an app available to providers in lowresource areas reducing the need for a trained diagnostic radiologist on site“the potential for this tech to increase access to healthcare is tremendous” said jayashree kalpathycramer phd assistant in neuroscience at mgh and associate professor of radiology at hmssource world medical innovation forum 2018 however algorithm developers must be careful to account for the fact that disparate ethnic groups or residents of different regions may have unique physiologies and environmental factors that will influence the presentation of disease “the course of a disease and population affected by the disease may look very different in india than in the us for example” she said “as we’re developing these algorithms it’s very important to make sure that the data represents a diversity of disease presentations and populations – we can’t just develop an algorithm based on a single population and expect it to work as well on others” reducing the burdens of electronic health record use ehrs have played an instrumental role in the healthcare industry’s journey towards digitalization but the switch has brought myriad problems associated with cognitive overload endless documentation and user burnout ehr developers are now using artificial intelligence to create more intuitive interfaces and automate some of the routine processes that consume so much of a user’s time users spend the majority of their time on three tasks clinical documentation order entry and sorting through the inbasket said adam landman md vice president and cio at brigham health voice recognition and dictation are helping to improve the clinical documentation process but natural language processing nlp tools might not be going far enough “i think we may need to be even bolder and consider changes like video recording a clinical encounter almost like police wear body cams” said landman “and then you can use ai and machine learning to index those videos for future information retrieval “and just like in the home where we’re using siri and alexa the future will bring virtual assistants to the bedside for clinicians to use with embedded intelligence for order entry” artificial intelligence may also help to process routine requests from the inbox like medication refills and result notifications it may also help to prioritize tasks that truly require the clinician’s attention landman added making it easier for users to work through their todo lists containing the risks of antibiotic resistance antibiotic resistance is a growing threat to populations around the world as overuse of these critical drugs fosters the evolution of superbugs that no longer respond to treatments multidrug resistant organisms can wreak havoc in the hospital setting and claim thousands of lives every year c difficile alone accounts for approximately 5 billion in annual costs for the us healthcare system and claims more than 30000 lives electronic health record data can help to identify infection patterns and highlight patients at risk before they begin to show symptoms leveraging machine learning and ai tools to drive these analytics can enhance their accuracy and create faster more accurate alerts for healthcare providers “ai tools can live up to the expectation for infection control and antibiotic resistance” erica shenoy md phd associate chief of the infection control unit at mgh “if they don’t then that’s really a failure on all of our parts for the hospitals sitting on mountains of ehr data and not using them to the fullest potential to industry that’s not creating smarter faster clinical trial design and for ehrs that are creating these data not to use them…that would be a failure” creating more precise analytics for pathology images pathologists provide one of the most significant sources of diagnostic data for providers across the spectrum of care delivery says jeffrey golden md chair of the department of pathology at bwh and a professor of pathology at hms “seventy percent of all decisions in healthcare are based on a pathology result” he said “somewhere between 70 and 75 percent of all the data in an ehr are from a pathology result so the more accurate we get and the sooner we get to the right diagnosis the better we’re going to be that’s what digital pathology and ai has the opportunity to deliver” analytics that can drill down to the pixel level on extremely large digital images can allow providers to identify nuances that may escape the human eye “we’re now getting to the point where we can do a better job of assessing whether a cancer is going to progress rapidly or slowly and how that might change how patients will be treated based on an algorithm rather than clinical staging or the histopathologic grade” said golden “that’s going to be a huge advance” artificial intelligence can also improve productivity by identifying features of interest in slides before a human clinician reviews the data he added “ai can screen through slides and direct us to the right thing to look at so we can assess what’s important and what’s not that increases the efficiency of the use of the pathologist and increases the value of the time they spend for each case” bringing intelligence to medical devices and machines smart devices are taking over the consumer environment offering everything from realtime video from the inside of a refrigerator to cars that can detect when the driver is distracted in the medical environment smart devices are critical for monitoring patients in the icu and elsewhere using artificial intelligence to enhance the ability to identify deterioration suggest that sepsis is taking hold or sense the development of complications can significantly improve outcomes and may reduce costs related to hospitalacquired condition penalties source thinkstock “when we’re talking about integrating disparate data from across the healthcare system integrating it and generating an alert that would alert an icu doctor to intervene early on – the aggregation of that data is not something that a human can do very well” said mark michalski md executive director of the mgh bwh center for clinical data science inserting intelligent algorithms into these devices can reduce cognitive burdens for physicians while ensuring that patients receive care in as timely a manner as possible advancing the use of immunotherapy for cancer treatment immunotherapy is one of the most promising avenues for treating cancer by using the body’s own immune system to attack malignancies patients may be able to beat stubborn tumors however only a small number of patients respond to current immunotherapy options and oncologists still do not have a precise and reliable method for identifying which patients will benefit from this option machine learning algorithms and their ability to synthesize highly complex datasets may be able to illuminate new options for targeting therapies to an individual’s unique genetic makeup “recently the most exciting development has been checkpoint inhibitors which block some of the proteins made by some times of immune cells” explained long le md phd director of computational pathology and technology development at the mgh center for integrated diagnostics “but we still don’t understand all of the disease biology this is a very complex problem” “we definitely need more patient data the therapies are relatively new so not a lot of patients have actually been put on these drugs so whether we need to integrate data within one institution or across multiple institutions is going to be a key factor in terms of augmenting the patient population to drive the modeling process” turning the electronic health record into a reliable risk predictor ehrs are a goldmine of patient data but extracting and analyzing that wealth of information in an accurate timely and reliable manner has been a continual challenge for providers and developers data quality and integrity issues plus a mishmash of data formats structured and unstructured inputs and incomplete records have made it very difficult to understand exactly how to engage in meaningful risk stratification predictive analytics and clinical decision support “part of the hard work is integrating the data into one place” observed ziad obermeyer md assistant professor of emergency medicine at bwh and assistant professor at hms “but another problem is understanding what it is you’re getting when you’re predicting a disease in an ehr” “you might hear that an algorithm can predict depression or stroke but when you scratch the surface you find what they’re actually predicting is a billing code for stroke that’s very different from stroke itself” relying on mri results might appear to offer a more concrete dataset he continued “but now you have to think about who can afford the mri and who can’t so what you end up predicting isn’t what you thought you were predicting you might be predicting billing for a stroke in people who can pay for a diagnostic rather than some sort of cerebral ischemia” ehr analytics have produced many successful risk scoring and stratification tools especially when researchers employ deep learning techniques to identify novel connections between seemingly unrelated datasets but ensuring that those algorithms do not confirm hidden biases in the data is crucial for deploying tools that will truly improve clinical care obermeyer maintained “the biggest challenge will be making sure exactly what we’re predicting even before we start opening up the black box and looking at how we’re predicting it” he said monitoring health through wearables and personal devices almost all consumers now have access to devices with sensors that can collect valuable data about their health from smartphones with step trackers to wearables that can track a heartbeat around the clock a growing proportion of healthrelated data is generated on the go collecting and analyzing this data – and supplementing it with patientprovided information through apps and other home monitoring devices – can offer a unique perspective into individual and population health artificial intelligence will play a significant role in extracting actionable insights from this large and varied treasure trove of data but helping patients get comfortable with sharing data from this intimate continual monitoring may require a little extra work says omar arnaout md codirector of the computation neuroscience outcomes center and an attending neurosurgeon at bwh “as a society we’ve been pretty liberal with our digital data” he said but as things come into our collective consciousness like cambridge analytica and facebook people will become more and more prudent about who they share what kinds of data with” however patients tend to trust their physicians more than they might trust a big company like facebook he added which may help to ease any discomfort with contributing data to largescale research initiatives “there’s a very good chance wearable data will have a major impact because our care is very episodic and the data we collect is very coarse” said arnaout “by collecting granular data in a continuous fashion there’s a greater likelihood that the data will help us take better care of patients” making smartphone selfies into powerful diagnostic tools continuing the theme of harnessing the power of portable devices experts believe that images taken from smartphones and other consumergrade sources will be an important supplement to clinical quality imaging – especially in underserved populations or developing nations the quality of cell phone cameras is increasing every year and can produce images that are viable for analysis by artificial intelligence algorithms dermatology and ophthalmology are early beneficiaries of this trend researchers in the united kingdom have even developed a tool that identifies developmental diseases by analyzing images of a child’s face the algorithm can detect discrete features such as a child’s jaw line eye and nose placement and other attributes that might indicate a craniofacial abnormality currently the tool can match the ordinary images to more than 90 disorders to provide clinical decision support “the majority of the population is equipped with pocketsized powerful devices that have a lot of different sensors built in” said hadi shafiee phd director of the laboratory of micronanomedicine and digital health at bwh “this is a great opportunity for us almost every major player in the industry has started to build ai software and hardware into their devices that’s not a coincidence every day in our digital world we generate more than 25 million terabytes of data in cell phones the manufacturers believe they can use that data with ai to provide much more personalized and faster and smarter services” source thinkstock using smartphones to collect images of eyes skin lesions wounds infections medications or other subjects may be able to help underserved areas cope with a shortage of specialists while reducing the timetodiagnosis for certain complaints “there is something big happening” said shafiee “we can leverage that opportunity to address some of the important problems with have in disease management at the point of care” revolutionizing clinical decision making with artificial intelligence at the bedside as the healthcare industry shifts away from feeforservice so too is it moving further and further from reactive care getting ahead of chronic diseases costly acute events and sudden deterioration is the goal of every provider – and reimbursement structures are finally allowing them to develop the processes that will enable proactive predictive interventions artificial intelligence will provide much of the bedrock for that evolution by powering predictive analytics and clinical decision support tools that clue providers in to problems long before they might otherwise recognize the need to act ai can provide earlier warnings for conditions like seizures or sepsis which often require intensive analysis of highly complex datasets machine learning can also help support decisions around whether or not to continue care for critically ill patients such as those who have entered a coma after cardiac arrest says brandon westover md phd director of the mgh clinical data animation center typically providers must visually inspect eeg data from these patients he explained the process is timeconsuming and subjective and the results may vary with the skill and experience of the individual clinician “in these patients trends might be slowly evolving” he said “sometimes when we’re looking to see if someone is recovering we take the data from ten seconds of monitoring at a time but trying to see if it changed from ten seconds of data taken 24 hours ago is like trying to look if your hair is growing longer” “but if you have an ai algorithm and lots and lots of data from many patients it’s easier to match up what you’re seeing to long term patterns and maybe detect subtle improvements that would impact your decisions around care” leveraging ai for clinical decision support risk scoring and early alerting is one of the most promising areas of development for this revolutionary approach to data analysis by powering a new generation of tools and systems that make clinicians more aware of nuances more efficient when delivering care and more likely to get ahead of developing problems ai will usher in a new era of clinical quality and exciting breakthroughs in patient care tagged artificial intelligence in healthcare chronic disease management deep learning healthcare ai focus imaging analytics machine learning medical research predictive analytics world medical innovation forumhowever algorithm developers must be careful to account for the fact that disparate ethnic groups or residents of different regions may have unique physiologies and environmental factors that will influence the presentation of disease“the course of a disease and population affected by the disease may look very different in india than in the us for example” she said“as we’re developing these algorithms it’s very important to make sure that the data represents a diversity of disease presentations and populations – we can’t just develop an algorithm based on a single population and expect it to work as well on others”ehrs have played an instrumental role in the healthcare industry’s journey towards digitalization but the switch has brought myriad problems associated with cognitive overload endless documentation and user burnoutehr developers are now using artificial intelligence to create more intuitive interfaces and automate some of the routine processes that consume so much of a user’s timeusers spend the majority of their time on three tasks clinical documentation order entry and sorting through the inbasket said adam landman md vice president and cio at brigham healthvoice recognition and dictation are helping to improve the clinical documentation process but natural language processing nlp tools might not be going far enough“i think we may need to be even bolder and consider changes like video recording a clinical encounter almost like police wear body cams” said landman “and then you can use ai and machine learning to index those videos for future information retrieval“and just like in the home where we’re using siri and alexa the future will bring virtual assistants to the bedside for clinicians to use with embedded intelligence for order entry”artificial intelligence may also help to process routine requests from the inbox like medication refills and result notifications it may also help to prioritize tasks that truly require the clinician’s attention landman added making it easier for users to work through their todo listsantibiotic resistance is a growing threat to populations around the world as overuse of these critical drugs fosters the evolution of superbugs that no longer respond to treatments multidrug resistant organisms can wreak havoc in the hospital setting and claim thousands of lives every yearc difficile alone accounts for approximately 5 billion in annual costs for the us healthcare system and claims more than 30000 liveselectronic health record data can help to identify infection patterns and highlight patients at risk before they begin to show symptoms leveraging machine learning and ai tools to drive these analytics can enhance their accuracy and create faster more accurate alerts for healthcare providers“ai tools can live up to the expectation for infection control and antibiotic resistance” erica shenoy md phd associate chief of the infection control unit at mgh“if they don’t then that’s really a failure on all of our parts for the hospitals sitting on mountains of ehr data and not using them to the fullest potential to industry that’s not creating smarter faster clinical trial design and for ehrs that are creating these data not to use them…that would be a failure”pathologists provide one of the most significant sources of diagnostic data for providers across the spectrum of care delivery says jeffrey golden md chair of the department of pathology at bwh and a professor of pathology at hms“seventy percent of all decisions in healthcare are based on a pathology result” he said “somewhere between 70 and 75 percent of all the data in an ehr are from a pathology result so the more accurate we get and the sooner we get to the right diagnosis the better we’re going to be that’s what digital pathology and ai has the opportunity to deliver”analytics that can drill down to the pixel level on extremely large digital images can allow providers to identify nuances that may escape the human eye“we’re now getting to the point where we can do a better job of assessing whether a cancer is going to progress rapidly or slowly and how that might change how patients will be treated based on an algorithm rather than clinical staging or the histopathologic grade” said golden “that’s going to be a huge advance”artificial intelligence can also improve productivity by identifying features of interest in slides before a human clinician reviews the data he added“ai can screen through slides and direct us to the right thing to look at so we can assess what’s important and what’s not that increases the efficiency of the use of the pathologist and increases the value of the time they spend for each case”smart devices are taking over the consumer environment offering everything from realtime video from the inside of a refrigerator to cars that can detect when the driver is distractedin the medical environment smart devices are critical for monitoring patients in the icu and elsewhere using artificial intelligence to enhance the ability to identify deterioration suggest that sepsis is taking hold or sense the development of complications can significantly improve outcomes and may reduce costs related to hospitalacquired condition penaltiessource thinkstock “when we’re talking about integrating disparate data from across the healthcare system integrating it and generating an alert that would alert an icu doctor to intervene early on – the aggregation of that data is not something that a human can do very well” said mark michalski md executive director of the mgh bwh center for clinical data science inserting intelligent algorithms into these devices can reduce cognitive burdens for physicians while ensuring that patients receive care in as timely a manner as possible advancing the use of immunotherapy for cancer treatment immunotherapy is one of the most promising avenues for treating cancer by using the body’s own immune system to attack malignancies patients may be able to beat stubborn tumors however only a small number of patients respond to current immunotherapy options and oncologists still do not have a precise and reliable method for identifying which patients will benefit from this option machine learning algorithms and their ability to synthesize highly complex datasets may be able to illuminate new options for targeting therapies to an individual’s unique genetic makeup “recently the most exciting development has been checkpoint inhibitors which block some of the proteins made by some times of immune cells” explained long le md phd director of computational pathology and technology development at the mgh center for integrated diagnostics “but we still don’t understand all of the disease biology this is a very complex problem” “we definitely need more patient data the therapies are relatively new so not a lot of patients have actually been put on these drugs so whether we need to integrate data within one institution or across multiple institutions is going to be a key factor in terms of augmenting the patient population to drive the modeling process” turning the electronic health record into a reliable risk predictor ehrs are a goldmine of patient data but extracting and analyzing that wealth of information in an accurate timely and reliable manner has been a continual challenge for providers and developers data quality and integrity issues plus a mishmash of data formats structured and unstructured inputs and incomplete records have made it very difficult to understand exactly how to engage in meaningful risk stratification predictive analytics and clinical decision support “part of the hard work is integrating the data into one place” observed ziad obermeyer md assistant professor of emergency medicine at bwh and assistant professor at hms “but another problem is understanding what it is you’re getting when you’re predicting a disease in an ehr” “you might hear that an algorithm can predict depression or stroke but when you scratch the surface you find what they’re actually predicting is a billing code for stroke that’s very different from stroke itself” relying on mri results might appear to offer a more concrete dataset he continued “but now you have to think about who can afford the mri and who can’t so what you end up predicting isn’t what you thought you were predicting you might be predicting billing for a stroke in people who can pay for a diagnostic rather than some sort of cerebral ischemia” ehr analytics have produced many successful risk scoring and stratification tools especially when researchers employ deep learning techniques to identify novel connections between seemingly unrelated datasets but ensuring that those algorithms do not confirm hidden biases in the data is crucial for deploying tools that will truly improve clinical care obermeyer maintained “the biggest challenge will be making sure exactly what we’re predicting even before we start opening up the black box and looking at how we’re predicting it” he said monitoring health through wearables and personal devices almost all consumers now have access to devices with sensors that can collect valuable data about their health from smartphones with step trackers to wearables that can track a heartbeat around the clock a growing proportion of healthrelated data is generated on the go collecting and analyzing this data – and supplementing it with patientprovided information through apps and other home monitoring devices – can offer a unique perspective into individual and population health artificial intelligence will play a significant role in extracting actionable insights from this large and varied treasure trove of data but helping patients get comfortable with sharing data from this intimate continual monitoring may require a little extra work says omar arnaout md codirector of the computation neuroscience outcomes center and an attending neurosurgeon at bwh “as a society we’ve been pretty liberal with our digital data” he said but as things come into our collective consciousness like cambridge analytica and facebook people will become more and more prudent about who they share what kinds of data with” however patients tend to trust their physicians more than they might trust a big company like facebook he added which may help to ease any discomfort with contributing data to largescale research initiatives “there’s a very good chance wearable data will have a major impact because our care is very episodic and the data we collect is very coarse” said arnaout “by collecting granular data in a continuous fashion there’s a greater likelihood that the data will help us take better care of patients” making smartphone selfies into powerful diagnostic tools continuing the theme of harnessing the power of portable devices experts believe that images taken from smartphones and other consumergrade sources will be an important supplement to clinical quality imaging – especially in underserved populations or developing nations the quality of cell phone cameras is increasing every year and can produce images that are viable for analysis by artificial intelligence algorithms dermatology and ophthalmology are early beneficiaries of this trend researchers in the united kingdom have even developed a tool that identifies developmental diseases by analyzing images of a child’s face the algorithm can detect discrete features such as a child’s jaw line eye and nose placement and other attributes that might indicate a craniofacial abnormality currently the tool can match the ordinary images to more than 90 disorders to provide clinical decision support “the majority of the population is equipped with pocketsized powerful devices that have a lot of different sensors built in” said hadi shafiee phd director of the laboratory of micronanomedicine and digital health at bwh “this is a great opportunity for us almost every major player in the industry has started to build ai software and hardware into their devices that’s not a coincidence every day in our digital world we generate more than 25 million terabytes of data in cell phones the manufacturers believe they can use that data with ai to provide much more personalized and faster and smarter services” source thinkstock using smartphones to collect images of eyes skin lesions wounds infections medications or other subjects may be able to help underserved areas cope with a shortage of specialists while reducing the timetodiagnosis for

challenging and discontented one of steven spielbergs finest and most fiercely misread filmsnick rogersprovocative movie suitable for teensnell minowa good ai would be of infinitely less value than the ai that we havea staggering creationtim braytonmr spielburgs continuing attempt to find the real filmmaker hiding inside of himalthough still interestingsuper reviewersuper reviewerai artificial intelligence was a project originally started by director stanley kubrick but never completed due to his death in 1999 and taken over by steven spielberg spielberg would craft this film based on notes that kubrick left behind and was able to make a captivating engaging picture that enthralled the viewer the film has some striking visuals and wonderful acting along with a richly detailed storyline that grabs your attention from start to finish due to its intricate concept spielberg manages to make a fine picture here and its very interesting what he does with the material of another director who unfortunately never got to make the film however with that being said spielberg manages to make something that is well constructed entertaining and thought provoking and memorable as well as solid direction from spielberg he has a talented cast to work with which only enhances the films experience ai artificial intelligence is a wonderful sci fi picture that displays a stunning amount of creativity and wonderful ideas the film deals with an interesting subject one that makes you ask questions and thats what keeps you involved in the film the fact that it makes you think with its concept is the key factor to the films entertainment factor the best way i would describe the film is a spider web of thought a film that just amps up its ideas to make them standout more due to its intricate plot and direction fans of the genre will surely enjoy this riveting picture and i must admit i didnt expect to enjoy the film the way i did but i was pleasantly surprised by the result upon watching the film you must ask yourself how this film would have turned out if stanley kubrick would have had the opportunity to direct it if he hadnt died who know how much more ambitious the film would have been nonetheless spielberg managed to create something quite entertaining captivating and memorable ai artificial intelligence is a worthwhile viewing experience that is enthralling right up to the final shotsuper reviewerdamn it spielberg you did it again i thought you wouldnt get me but once again you made me cry whilst watching one of your films sheesh rightai batten down the hatches mateys this could be a big one from the collective minds of kubrick and spielberg comes this lavish epic about a little robot boy who is brought into a young couples life based on a short story by a writer i admit ive never heard of yet the idea could easily be mistaken for work from the brains of arthur c clarke isaac asimov or philip k dick lets begin this film gave me a headache not a bad headache more of a problematic headache i was stuck and didnt know what to think the film is a massive story betwixt two ideas or genres almost on one hand you have the first half of a film that centres around the human angst and emotion of trying to adapt to adopting a robot child the pain of a mother whos child is at deaths door from disease and the decision by her husband to offer her a brand new state of the art robot child that for the first time can learn and express love for its owner the second half of the film then changes completely gone is the sentiment and powerful family bound plot as we enter into a more seedy grim world one could almost say the film adopts many visual concepts from other scifi filmsgenres which do work on their own but maybe not together with this story the story is enthralling and draws you inbut oh so many questions arise mr spielberg where to begin once we leave the comfort of the family orientated first part of the film we pretty much straight away hit the flesh fair now this really did seem too harsh for me a completely disjoined idea that harks back to a mad max type world why would people of the future act like this towards simple machines the whole sequence looked like some freaky red neck carnival it also seemed like a huge setup for not very much just a few minutes of carnage was all that fan fair really required this lead me to the question of why do this to old lost outdated mechas the term for robots in this film which sounds a bit japanese to me now surely these robots cost a lot to make much time effort design etcwent into creating them so surely destroying them is a complete waste wouldnt fixing them up for simple labour tasks like cleaning or whatever be more useful maybe selling them on and even if you did have to shut them down just do it more humanly why the need for all the violence the whole sequence just didnt seem sensible really and it was thought up by spielberg eventually we get to rouge city where is this suppose to be why not use a real city again the whole concept seemed out of place the city seemed much more futuristic than everything else we have seen plus the architecture was truly odd the huge tunnel bridges with a womans gaping open mouth as the opening it seemed very gigeresq to me quite sexual too kids film anyone then you had buildings shaped like womens boobs and legs etcgeez its here we meet gigolo joe who is superbly played by jude law i cant deny but really at the end of the day was he needed at all he is a nice character very likeable but virtually bordering on a cartoon character and why the need for the tap dancing the makeup was very good for the mecha characters simple yet effective for both law and osment kudos to osment of course for his portrayal of the robot david i honestly can say its probably the best performance for a robot ive ever seen brilliant casting too i might add osment can act but his looks are half the battle won right there he has this almost perfect plastic looking young face its all in the eyes i think speaking of characters how can i not mention the star of the film teddy now this little guy was adorable i still find myself wanting my own teddy whimpers every scene this little fellow was in i loved i loved to see him waddle around and assist david in his simple electronic voice i found myself caring for all the characters in this film but especially teddy he was just awesome sure he seemed to have some kind of infinite power source but that made him even cooler damn it what really broke my heart was we dont know what happens to lill teddy we see him at the end but what becomes of him what steven what i loved that lill guy sniff as you near the end of the film and its multiple ongoing finales you literately get submerged in questions 2000 years pass from the time david is trapped under the sea and his rescue the ferris wheel didnt crush the helicoptersub thingy in that time the planet has gone from global warming jungles to a massive ice age i mean a really heavy ice age now im no scientist but that doesnt seem right i might quickly add in the future why are all the skyscrapers in new york in tatters as if theyve been burnt out sure the bottom of them has been flooded but they look like skeletons as if a nuke hit them eh the we get to the evolved mechas or close encounter aliens how would these robots evolve into these angelic liquidlike creatures i dont get it if the human race became extinct tomorrow would computers evolve into alienlike creatures sure these robots can fix themselves and update themselves but that far really then you gotta ask yourself why would they be digging up old human remains they know humans created them ok they might not understand why but does that matter they clearly have highly advanced technology so why dont they travel space and look for new similar intelligent life why bother with the human race of which many despised them anyway treated them like crap this then leads onto the resurrection part of the story i still cant quite work out why davids mother would only live for one day when brought back there is an explanation from the advanced mechas but i couldnt follow it again we then have all manner of plot issueswhy his mother doesnt recall her husband or son when she wakes she doesnt question why david is there shes disorientated but doesnt question anything she doesnt seem to remember anything like the fact she was probably an old lady when she was last awake and she doesnt ask to go outside they stay inside the whole time you could say the advanced mecha fixed it so she wouldnt recall anything so not to jeopardize the situation but when she wakes she acts as if nothing happened and its just a new day where the plot really gets silly is the fact this is all possible simply because teddy kept some strands of cut hair from davids mother about 2000 years prior where on earth did he keep these hairs its not like he has pockets and whats morewhy did he keep the strands of hair on top of that and again im no scientist but surely youd need the roots of human hair for the dna not just cut strands no now there are a lot of whines in there but unfortunately there are a lot of plot issues in the film i wont and cant say its a bad film its a truly fantastic bit of scifi with some lovely design work and visuals but there are problems along the way first half is a decent scifi story similar to bicentennial man second half is really a rehashed rip off of the classic pinocchio tale set in the future the film garnered a lot of interest due to the involvement of kubrick and spielberg admittedly but its still a wonderful bit of work part scifi but all fairytale in the end the film slowly becomes more of a childrens tale the deeper you go the narration nails that home if you think about it the very end is kinda tacked on and doesnt feel correct true you can see they had trouble ending the film and a weepy ending was required so they made one but god damn it works sniff the final sequence of david lying besides his motionless mother still brings a lump to my throat as i type this now we then see teddy join them on the bed and just sit down to watch over them both like a guardian does david actually die here does he voluntarily switch himself off somehow againwhat happens to teddy im not sure but as the score swells and the lights dim you cant help but wipe away a tearsuper reviewerview all quotesview all', 'ul': 'home box office tv dvd morenews my account sign up log inmovies dvds movies

everywhere from apples iphone keyboard to zillows home price estimates theres also a lot of stuff out there that marketers are calling ai but really isntperhaps things reached a new high point last month when alphago a virtual player of the ancient chinese board game go developed by alphabets deepmind ai research group trounced the top human player in the world chinas ke jiea moment of drama encapsulates the achievement after jie resigned in the second of three matches the 19yearold lingered in his chair staring down at the board for several minutes fidgeting with game pieces and scratching his head aja huang the deepmind senior research scientist who was tasked with moving game pieces on behalf of alphago eventually got up from his chair and walked offstage leaving jie alone for a momentstill its generally true that a human being like jie has more brainpower than a computer thats because a person can perform a wide range of tasks better than machines while a given computer program enhanced with ai like alphago might be able to edge out a person at just a few thingsbut the prospect of ai becoming smarter than people at most tasks is the single biggest thing that drives debates about effects on employment creativity and even human existenceheres an overview of what ai really is and what the biggest companies are doing with itgiven that everybodys talking about ai now you would think its new but the underlying techniques are not the field got its start in the midtwentieth century and one of its most popular methods came about in the 1980sai first took hold in the 1950s while some of its underlying concepts predate it the term itself dates to 1956 when john mccarthy a math professor at dartmouth college proposed a summer research project based on the idea that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate itin the next few years ai research labs popped up at the massachusetts institute of technology mit and stanford university research touched on computer chess robotics and naturallanguage communicationinterest in the field fluctuated over time ai winters came in the 1970s and 1980s as public interest waned and outside funding dried up startups boasting promising capabilities and venture capital backing in the mid1980s abruptly disappeared as john markoff detailed in his 2015 book machines of loving gracethere are several other terms you often hear in connection to aimachine learning generally entails teaching a machine how to do a particular thing like recognizing a number by feeding it a bunch of data and then directing it to make predictions on new datathe big deal about machine learning now is that its getting easier to invent software that can learn over time and get smarter as it accumulates more and more data machine learning often requires people to handengineer certain features for the machine to look for which can be complex and timeconsumingdeep learning is one type of machine learning that demands less handengineering of features often the approach involves artificial neural networks a mathematical system loosely inspired by the way neurons work together in the human brain neuroscientist warren mcculloch and mathematician walter pitts came up with the first such system in 1943 through the years researchers advanced the concept with various techniques including adding multiple layers with each successive layer higherlevel features could be detected in the original data to make a better prediction the layers pick out features in the data themselves but using more layers demands more computing powerthrough the years hardware has gotten more powerful and chipmakers including nvidia have refined their products to better suit ai computations larger data sets in many domains have become available to train models more extensively as wellin 2012 google made headlines when it trained a neural network with 16000 central processing unit cpu chips on 10 million images from youtube videos and taught it to recognize cats but later that year the world of image recognition was rocked when an eightlayer neural network trained on two graphics processing units gpus outdid all others in a competition to accurately classify images based on their content months later google acquired dnnresearch the university of toronto team behind the breakthroughsince then ai activity has only accelerated with the worlds top technology companies leading the waymeanwhile the worlds most valuable companies technology companies continue to publish research on their latest gains which only adds to the fascinationgoogle and its parent company alphabet have made several ai acquisitions the most significant being its reported 500 million purchase of deepmind in 2014 while deepminds alphago project has brought alphabet lots of attention deepminds ai software has led to real business value lowering the cost of cooling google data centers by some 40 percentmeanwhile google has enhanced its core search engine gmail google street view google photos google translate youtube and other applications using aiin recent years several opensource frameworks for deep learning have emerged but googles tensorflow is thought to be the most popular googlers have even developed a tensor processing unit tpu to accelerate network network training and predictions beyond whats currently possible with commercially available silicon and alphabets waymo is at the forefront of autonomous vehicle researchalphabet research scientists regularly publish academic papers on their latest achievements which is somewhat rare in a such a highly competitive industry that values secrecy in fact ai is so important to the company that google ceo sundar pichai has begun describing google is an aifirst companyamazon has long used ai to recommend products in its ecommerce business and it employs robots to move products around fulfillment centersbut in the past few years the company has brought in some revenue by selling amazon echo speakers through which people can talk to amazons alexa virtual assistant while alexas speech recognition isnt perfect it does quickly respond to user input and it plugs into an increasing number of thirdparty services and devicesbuilding on the publics fascination with alexa amazon last year introduced ai services for recognizing objects in images and understanding voice and text input amazon has also opened a convenience store that uses ai to identify the products that customers grab off the shelvesapple has looked to ai to recognize handwriting lengthen device battery life and even find the text that could be selected in pdf files but siri apples virtual assistant on iphones and other apple hardware uses deep learning now and the company has recently announced the homepod speaker that packages up siriapple has also sought to improve image recognition in its photos app and emoji prediction in the quicktype keyboard on iosmost recently apple introduced core ml a software library for running machine learning workloads including neural networks on apple devices apple is also reported to be developing an ai chip that could be tucked inside its mobile deviceson the whole apple has sought to differentiate its ai efforts by emphasizing privacy the company has not published much of its ai research although it did recently hire a prominent researcher russ salakhutdinov as its director of ai research it has also accumulated talent through acquisitions of startups like perceptiofacebook set up an ai research group in 2013 with the hire of yann lecun who is known for popularizing a technique called convolutional neural networks you can see him explaining the technique in this video from 1993the group often publishes research papers and has released the caffe2 and pytorch opensource ai frameworks it has even come up with special server hardware thats optimized for deep learning with gpusbut facebook has also looked to ai to better rank posts in the news feed translate users posts into different languages and even generate text descriptions of users images most recently facebook said it would try to curtail terrorismrelated content with the help of ailast year facebook ceo mark zuckerberg cited ai along with virtual reality augmented reality and connectivity in its 10year roadmap pointing to vision language reasoning and planning as areas of explorationmicrosoft has employed ai researchers for many years although in september ai appeared to become a higher priority with the formation of its microsoft ai and research groupmicrosoft has incorporated ai into cortana word powerpoint skype and sql server earlier this year it introduced story mix an video editing app that can keep additions like stickers tied to specific objects as they move in video thanks to ai microsoft has also introduced services for speech recognition computer vision emotion detection and video understanding that developers can use in their own apps microsoft fields the cognitive toolkit opensource ai frameworknone of this gets at whats possible in the futurefirst more of human labor could be automated drivers at appenabled cab companies like uber and lyft for example could find themselves without work as selfdriving cars using ai become acceptable for everyday travel machine translation systems could render human translators unnecessary except for specialty jobs banks would not need to employ tellers once atms can create new accounts and give out loans fewer journalists will be needed to write the news the thought of those developments has lead to discussion of alternative economic models like universal basic income which zuckerberg recently talked upbeyond that perhaps in a few decades an ai system with superhuman capabilities in most domains sometimes referred to as artificial general intelligence could emerge depending on whom you ask that could be either very good or very bad in an extreme case an agi system could end up making humans extinct but if things go well perhaps agi will be something that will supercharge humans and help them live longer the prospect of either of these two scenarios is perhaps what draws so much attention to ai development today and what has inspired so much science fiction in the pastbut for now what people generally see is narrow ai intelligence applied to a small number of domains and it doesnt always work the way it should look at alexa cortana the google assistant or siri they misunderstand spoken words all the timethe thing is the biggest companies in the world are now investing in ai like never before and that trend is not about to let upgot a confidential news tip we want to hear from yousign up for free newsletters and get more cnbc delivered to your inboxget this delivered to your inbox

favorite authorsyoure reading entrepreneur india an international franchise of entrepreneur mediaone of the landmark events in the course of evolution of technology has been the advent of artificial intelligence which has subsequently impacted different sectors of the society profoundly its multifaceted benefits have successfully initiated a complete paradigm shift even in our education sectoreducation is one of the primary tools which is inextricably linked with the growth of human resources in the country artificial intelligence immensely helps to accentuate the growth and development index it utilizes data models as part of primary and secondary data sources and makes decisions based on the input data whose success rate improves with further iterations just as a teacher needs to get acquainted with the behaviour and understanding pattern of a student before recommending a learning path artificial intelligence also requires proper input data for better analysis and execution the algorithm however is cumbersome with a large collection of data points increasing the complexity5 ways in which artificial intelligence has become a game changer in the field of education are as follows1 ai to help in personalised learningevery student is unique in behaviour and appreciation thereby demanding different degrees of care and attention in a classroom comprising a high number of students attending every doubt of each student remains no longer feasible artificial intelligence can help in developing personalized learning which can mitigate individual doubts and thus enhance their performances2 adaptive test prepexams are important for any student in pursuit of knowledge for it provides one with an honest assessment of progress in the respective domain this demands an appropriate set of questions for the examination whose difficulty gets updated as a student progresses and challenges him to prepare thoroughly3 addressing vernacular needfor students in vernacular learning realtime translation ensures that the medium is democratized thereby also incorporating maximum students to enjoy the fruits of such technological advancement it will also significantly reduce the cost of content production4 automatic doubt solvingclearing of doubts is fundamental to the process of learning artificial intelligence engine can successfully read the problem statement and suggest a possible solution to the learners5 interactive gamificationartificial intelligence is instrumental in devising different tools and techniques which are immensely effective in teaching highly complex concepts in a simple and lucid way this includes incorporation of sophisticated and useful illustrations virtual reality and artificial reality tools which can streamline intelligent concepts into accessible cognitive models6 automation of grading activitiesfrom standard one to graduation to higher studies the grading is the only way to evaluate the performance of students and it is a tedious job for teachers to grade their students technological advancements and artificial intelligence through various applications and tools can perform the grading of exams and assignments automatically for example for multiple choice questions fill in the blanks etc the system will match the student’s answer with the answer keys saved in the application and give the grades accordingly it will not be long before artificial intelligence will start grading long answers and this in turn will save a lot of time for the teachers and they can focus on other activities and provide more attention to studentsthere are many more ways how artificial intelligence can help in imparting quality education to students in large numbers this scientific development will not only benefit the larger education ecosystem but also produce the brightest of mindsi agree to the entrepreneur privacy policy and terms of use', 'ul': 'my account entrepreneur insider saved

study the differences between artificial intelligence and human intelligence in a detailartificial intelligence is the study and design of intelligent agent these intelligent agents have the ability to analyze the environments and produce actions which maximize successai research uses tools and insights from many fields including computer science psychology philosophy neuroscience cognitive science linguistics operations research economics control theory probability optimization and logicai research also overlaps with tasks such as robotics control systems scheduling data mining logistics speech recognition facial recognition and many othershuman intelligence is defined as the quality of the mind that is made up of capabilities to learn from past experience adaptation to new situations handling of abstract ideas and the ability to change hisher own environment using the gained knowledgehuman intelligence can provide several kinds of information it can provide observations during travel or other events from travelers refugees escaped friendly pows etc it can provide data on things about which the subject has specific knowledge which can be another human subject or in the case of defectors and spies sensitive information to which they had access finally it can provide information on interpersonal relationships and networks of interestbelow is the top 5 differences between artificial intelligence vs human intelligencebelow are the lists of points describe the key differences between artificial intelligence and human intelligencenature of existencehuman intelligence revolves around adapting to the environment using a combination of several cognitive processesthe field of artificial intelligence focuses on designing machines that can mimic human behaviormemory usagehumans use content memory and thinking whereas robots are using the builtin instructions designed by scientistsmode of creationhuman intelligence is bigger because its creation of god and artificial intelligence as the name suggests is artificial little and temporary created by humans also humans intelligence is the real creator of the artificial intelligence even but they cannot create a human being with superioritylearning processhuman intelligence is based on the variants they encounter in life and responses they get which may result in millions of functions overall in their lives however for artificial intelligence is defined or developed for specific tasks only and its applicability on other tasks may not be easily possibledominanceartificial intelligence can beat human intelligence in some specific areas such as in chess a supercomputer has beaten the human player due to being able to store all the moves played by all humans so far and being able to think ahead 10 moves as compared to human players who can think 10 steps ahead but cannot store and retrieve that number of moves in chesspoints to notefollowing is the set of points shows the comparison between artificial intelligence vs human intelligencefactorhumans usually learn how to manage hundreds of different skills during lifewhile consuming kilowatts of energy this machine is usually designed for a few tasksthe time needed to teach system on each and every response is considerably higheven the most advanced robots can hardly compete in mobility with 6 years old child and this results we have after 60 years of research and developmenthuman intelligence revolves around adapting to the environment using a combination of several cognitive processes the field of artificial intelligence focuses on designing machines that can mimic human behavior however ai researchers are able to go as far as implementing weak ai but not the strong ai in fact some believe that strong ai is never possible due to the various differences between the human brain and a computer so at the moment the mere ability to mimic the human behavior is considered as artificial intelligencealso the utilization of artificial intelligence will surely make life even more convenient for humankind in the years to come and even force humans to evolve their skill sets it will perhaps never be possible for such machines to completely replace the human resourcethis has been a guide to differences between artificial intelligence and human intelligence their meaning head to head comparison key

professor at the massachusetts institute of technology who is working on improving mammography with artificial intelligence kayana szymczak for npr hide captioni was really surprised how primitive information technology is in the hospitals says regina barzilay a professor at the massachusetts institute of technology who is working on improving mammography with artificial intelligenceregina barzilay teaches one of the most popular computer science classes at the massachusetts institute of technologyand in her research — at least until five years ago — she looked at how a computer could use machine learning to read and decipher obscure ancient textsthis is clearly of no practical use she says with a laugh but it was really cool and i was really obsessed about this topic how machines could do itbut in 2014 barzilay was diagnosed with breast cancer and that not only disrupted her life but it led her to rethink her research career she has landed at the vanguard of a rapidly growing effort to revolutionize mammography and breast cancer management with the use of computer algorithmsshe started down that path after her disease put her into the deep end of the american medical system she found it bafflingi was really surprised how primitive information technology is in the hospitals she says it almost felt that we were in a different centuryquestions that seemed answerable were hopelessly out of reach even though the hospital had plenty of data to work fromat every point of my treatment there would be some point of uncertainty and i would say gosh i wish we had the technology to solve it she says so when i was done with the treatment i started my long journey toward this goalgetting started wasnt so easy barzilay found that the national cancer institute wasnt interested in funding her research on using artificial intelligence to improve breast cancer treatment likewise she says she couldnt get money out of the national science foundation which funds computer studies but private foundations ultimately stepped up to get the work rollingbarzilay struck up a collaboration with connie lehman a harvard university radiologist who is chief of breast imaging at massachusetts general hospital we meet in a dim hushed room where she shows me the progress that she and her colleagues have made in bringing artificial intelligence to one of the most common medical exams in the united states more than 39 million mammograms are performed annually according to data from the food and drug administrationstep one in reading a mammogram is to determine breast density lehmans first collaboration with barzilay was to develop whats called a deeplearning algorithm to perform this essential taskwere excited about this because we find theres a lot of human variation in assessing breast density lehman says and so weve trained our deeplearning model to assess the density in a much more consistent waylehman reads a mammogram and assesses the density then she pushes a button to see what the algorithm concluded the assessments matchnext she toggles back and forth between new breast images and those taken at the patients previous appointment doing this job is the next task she hopes computer models will take overthe optimist in me says in three years we can train this tool to read mammograms as well as an average radiologist says connie lehman chief of breast imaging at massachusetts general hospital in boston kayana szymczak for npr hide captionthe optimist in me says in three years we can train this tool to read mammograms as well as an average radiologist says connie lehman chief of breast imaging at massachusetts general hospital in bostonthese are the sorts of things that we can also teach a model but more importantly we allow the model to teach itself she says thats the power of artificial intelligence — its not simply automating rules that the researchers provide but also creating its own rulesthe optimist in me says in three years we can train this tool to read mammograms as well as an average radiologist she says so well see thats what were working onthis is an area thats evolving rapidly for example researchers at radboud university medical center in the netherlands spun off a company screenpoint medical that can read mammograms as well as the average radiologist now says ioannis sechopoulos a radiologist at the university who ran a study to evaluate the softwarea very good breast radiologist is still better than the computer sechopoulos says but theres no theoretical reason for the software not to become as good as the best breast radiologists in the worldat least initially sechopoulos suggests computers could identify mammograms that are clearly normal so we can get rid of the human reading a significant portion of normal mammograms he says that could free up radiologists to perform more demanding tasks and could potentially save moneysechopoulos says the biggest challenge now isnt technology but ethics when the algorithm makes a mistake then whos responsible and who do we sue he asks that medicallegal aspect has to be solved firstlehman sees other challenges one question shes starting to explore is whether women will be comfortable having this potentially lifeordeath task turned over to a computer algorithmi know a lot of people say im intrigued by artificial intelligence but im not sure im ready to get in the back of the car and let the computer drive me around unless theres a human being there to take the wheel when necessary lehman saysshe asks a patient susan biener bergman a 62yearold physician from a nearby suburb how she feels about itbergman agrees that giving that much control to a computer is creepy but she also sees the value in automation computers remember facts better than humans do she says and as long as a trustworthy human being is still in the loop shes ok with empowering an algorithm to read her mammogramlehman is happy to hear that but shes also mindful that trusted technologies havent always been trustworthy twenty years ago radiologists adopted a technology called cad short for computeraided detection which was supposed to help them find tumors on mammogramsthe cad story is a pretty uncomfortable one for us in mammography lehman saysthe technology became ubiquitous due to the efforts of its commercial developers they lobbied to have cad paid for she says and they convinced congress this is better for women — and if you want your women constituents to know that you support women you should support thisonce medicare agreed to pay for it cad became widely adopted despite misgivings among many radiologistsa few years ago lehman and her colleagues decided to see if cad was actually beneficial they compared doctors at centers that used the software with doctors at those that didnt to see who was more adept at finding suspicious spotsradiologists actually did better at centers without cad lehman and her colleagues concluded in a study doctors may have been distracted by so many false indications that popped up on the mammograms or perhaps they became complacent figuring the computer was doing a perfect jobwhatever the reason lehman says we want to make sure as were developing and evaluating and implementing artificial intelligence and deep learning we dont repeat the mistakes of our pastthats certainly on the mind of joshua fenton a family practice doctor at the university of california davis center for healthcare policy and research he has written about the evidence that led the fda to let companies market cad technologyit was quote promising data but definitely not blockbuster data — definitely not large population studies or randomized trials fenton saysthe agency didnt foresee how doctors would change their behavior — evidently not for the better — when using computers equipped with the softwarewe cant always anticipate how a technology will be used in practice fenton says so he would like the fda to monitor software like this after it has been on the market to see if its use is actually improving medical carethose challenges will grow as algorithms take on ever more tasks and thats on the notsodistant horizonlehman and barzilay are already thinking beyond the initial reading of mammograms and are looking for algorithms to pick up tasks that humans currently cant perform well or at allone project is an algorithm that can examine a highrisk spot on a mammogram and provide advice about whether a biopsy is necessary reducing the number of unnecessary biopsies would reduce costs and help women avoid the procedurein 2017 barzilay lehman and colleagues reported that their algorithm could reduce biopsies by about 30 percentthey have also developed a computer program that analyzes a lot of information about a patient to predict future risk of breast cancerthe first time you go and do your screening barzilay says the algorithm doesnt just look for cancer on your mammogram — the model tells you what is the likelihood that you develop cancer within two years three years 10 yearsthat projection can help women and doctors decide how frequently to screen for breast cancerwere so excited about it because it is a stronger predictor than anything else that weve found out there lehman says unlike other tools like this which were developed by examining predominantly white european women it works well among women of all races and ages she sayslehman is mindful that an algorithm developed at one hospital or among one demographic might fail when tried elsewhere so her research addresses that issue but potential pitfalls arent what keep her up at nightwhat keeps me up at night is 500000 women worldwide die every year of breast cancer she says she would like to find ways to accelerate progress so that innovations can help people soonerand that imperative calls for more than new technology she says — it calls for a new philosophywere too fearful of change she says were too fearful of losing our jobs were too fearful of things not staying the way theyve always been were going to have to think differentlyyou can contact npr science

investments in ai are already changing our lives and gadgets and laying the groundwork for a more aicentric futurethe current boom in all things ai was catalyzed by breakthroughs in an area known as machine learning it involves “training” computers to perform tasks based on examples rather than by relying on programming by a human a technique called deep learning has made this approach much more powerful just ask lee sedol holder of 18 international titles at the complex game of go he got creamed by software called alphago in 2016for most of us the most obvious results of the improved powers of ai are neat new gadgets and experiences such as smart speakers or being able to unlock your iphone with your face but ai is also poised to reinvent other areas of life one is health care hospitals in india are testing software that checks images of a person’s retina for signs of diabetic retinopathy a condition frequently diagnosed too late to prevent vision loss machine learning is vital to projects in autonomous driving where it allows a vehicle to make sense of its surroundingsthere’s evidence that ai can make us happier and healthier but there’s also reason for caution incidents in

vacation project dartmouth professor john mccarthy coined the term in the summer of 1956 when he invited a small group to spend a few weeks musing on how to make machines do things like use language he had high hopes of a breakthrough toward humanlevel machines “we think that a significant advance can be made” he wrote with his coorganizers “if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it

of intelligent machines coalesce into a proper academic fieldearly work often focused on solving fairly abstract problems in math and logic but it wasn’t long before ai started to show promising results on more human tasks in the late 1950s arthur samuel created programs that learned to play checkers in 1962 one scored a win over a master at the game in 1967 a program called dendral showed it

researchers tried to distill human knowledge into code or come up with rules for tasks like understanding language others were inspired by the importance of learning to human and animal intelligence they built systems that could get better at a task over time perhaps by simulating evolution or by learning from example data the field hit milestone after milestone as computers mastered more tasks that could previously be done only by peopledeep learning the rocket fuel of the current ai boom is a revival of one of the oldest ideas in ai the technique involves passing data through webs of math loosely inspired by how brain cells work known as artificial neural networks as a network processes training data connections between the parts of the network adjust building up an ability to interpret future dataartificial neural networks became an established idea in ai not long after the dartmouth workshop the roomfilling perceptron mark 1 from 1958 for example learned to distinguish different geometric shapes and got written up in the new york times as the “embryo of computer designed to read and grow wiser” but neural networks tumbled from favor after an influential 1969 book coauthored by mit’s marvin minsky suggested they couldn’t be very powerfulnot everyone was convinced and some researchers kept the technique alive over the decades they were vindicated in 2012 when a series of experiments showed that neural networks fueled with large piles of data and powerful computer chips could give machines new powers of perceptionin one notable result researchers at the university of toronto trounced rivals in an annual competition where software is tasked with categorizing images in another researchers from ibm microsoft and google teamed up to publish results showing deep learning could also deliver a significant jump in the accuracy of speech recognition tech companies began frantically hiring all the deeplearning experts they could findeven if progress on making artificial intelligence smarter stops tomorrow don’t expect to stop hearing about how it’s changing the worldbig tech companies such as google microsoft and amazon have amassed strong rosters of ai talent and impressive arrays of computers to bolster their core businesses of targeting ads or anticipating your next purchasethey’ve also begun trying to make money by inviting others to run ai projects on their networks which will help propel advances in areas such as health care or national security improvements to ai hardware growth in training courses in machine learning and open source machinelearning projects will also accelerate the spread of ai into other industriesthe development of computers capable of tasks that typically require human intelligenceusing example data or experience to refine how computers make predictions or perform a taska machine learning technique in which data is filtered through selfadjusting networks of math loosely inspired by neurons

not generally practical for machines yetsoftware that experiments with different actions to figure out how to maximize a virtual reward such as scoring points in a gameas yet nonexistent software that displays a humanlike ability to adapt to different environments and tasks and transfer knowledge between themmeanwhile consumers can expect to be pitched more gadgets and services with aipowered features google and amazon in particular are betting that improvements in machine learning will make their virtual assistants and smart speakers more powerful amazon for example has devices with cameras to look at their owners and the world around themthe commercial possibilities make this a great time to be an ai researcher labs investigating how to make smarter machines are more numerous and betterfunded than ever and there’s plenty to work on despite the flurry of recent progress in ai and wild prognostications about its near future there are still many things that machines can’t do such as understanding the nuances of language commonsense reasoning and learning a new skill from just one or two examples ai software will need to master tasks like these if it is to get close to the multifaceted adaptable and creative intelligence of humans one deeplearning pioneer google’s geoff hinton argues that making progress on that grand challenge will require rethinking some of the foundations of the fieldas ai systems grow more powerful they will rightly invite more scrutiny government use of software in areas such as criminal justice is often flawed or secretive and corporations like facebook have begun confronting the downsides of their own lifeshaping algorithms more powerful ai has the potential to create worse problems for example by perpetuating historical biases and stereotypes against women or black people civilsociety groups and even the tech industry itself are now exploring rules and guidelines on the safety and ethics of ai for us to truly reap

browser click here to turn on notificationsxtrendingthere is a scene in the artificial intelligence movie “ex machina” where a human turns out to be a robot it’s the type of robot that comes to mind when talking to people like michael ashley and neil sahotathe big difference between the robot and ashley and sahota is that unlike the ai’s creepy path these two humans predict a better future with artificial intelligencestill if you watch as much science fiction as i do you know it’s also possible humankind is already lostwhat if ashley and sahota are actually robotsconsider that it was just seven months ago when sahota wrote an article in forbes magazine titled “ai may have written this article but is that such a bad thing”uh yeah from where i stand replacing flesh and bone writers with robots would be very a bad thingbut this column as my wife sometimes reminds me isn’t about me so let’s look into the future with these two experts who will publish a book in may titled “own the ai revolution unlock your artificial intelligence strategy to disrupt your competitors”that’s right if you’re not already thinking about ai it’s time to update your brain for the 21st centuryif you’re like my wife a fullerton college professor your morning is different than it was before gadgets like google home alexa or sirimy wife gets up and asks google what her day looks like her virtual assistant tells her the weather what her drive will be like and her schedule for the day i ask google for a joke“at 630 it’s hands down”true the joke is pretty lame but seriously folks when was the last time a machine told you a jokeseveral experts in ashley and sahota’s book say those interactions with google show that artificial intelligence has already arrived but sahota one of 300 ibm “master inventors” is more circumspecta united nations ai expert resource sahota argues what’s known as general artificial intelligence or agi may not appear for a very long timewhen sahota helped ibm develop a question answering machine named watson that in 2011 won a “jeopardy” contest the world was aflutter over what might happen nextwould watson grow into something like skynet the maker of killer bots in the “terminator” movieshardly ibm didn’t even let watson go shopping after it won a cool 1 million instead ibm gave the money to charity still some called watson’s triumph a coming out party for aibut sahota and others say not so fast they say true artificial intelligence requires three thingsone the ability to learn whether from a person or being selftaughttwo the ability to understand natural language such as differentiating between word definitions and idioms such as “it’s raining cats and dogs”three the ability to interact with a person with something that resembles empathy being sentient or consciousnessjohn searle is a philosopher and professor emeritus at uc berkeley he maintains watson doesn’t have artificial intelligence and notes the machine is only capable of manipulating symbols but doesn’t really understand the meaning behind the symbolssahota agrees “there’s lot of hype” says the uci lecturer “but google home is not ai”so what is my beloved google home nothing more than a chatbotbut hey we’re only beginning to glimpse the futuresahota who earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees at uci allows that ai could be on the verge of becominggenesys telecommunications laboratories for example started using watson four years ago to help handle customer relations two years later manipal hospitals began using watson to help identify and communicate cancer care options to patientsthe next big jump was when david hanson founder and ceo of hanson robotics introduced “sophia” to the world she was so popular saudi arabia actually granted the robot citizenshipin their upcoming book ashley and sahota interview hanson who says his success in part is due to a philosophy of playfulness “possessing a spirit of creative play allows us to work through the differences in language culture and disciplines”already sophia the robot is impacting the future a japanese company for example is developing robot caregiversif artificial empathy is developed sahota says these bots could become say companions for elderly people who suffer from lonelinessif that happens the 20thcentury concept that machines are about productivity and humans are about creativity starts to break down as ai moves ahead in quantum leaps exceptionally complex ethical questions start to pile upin his work with the un sahota tackles such thorny questions as should bots with artificial intelligence be paid who decides how they spend their money what if the machine needs maintenance should metoo become involvedashley who earned his master’s at chapman university asks “how do we define consciousness”these are explosive questions in a world in which different countries are developing ai at different rateschina is arguably the top nation in nurturing and developing ai says sahota he estimates the united states ranks about number five and sadly he doesn’t expect much change in the near futurecalifornia he notes didn’t even have an ai plan in place until last year — and this is the home of silicon valley“we need a ‘moonshot’ program” sahota allows “and no one is really saying we need a ‘moonshot’ we’re doing it piecemeal and siloed”how ai fits into the future and where it fits remain unknown for some that’s scary but for those in the know it’s no worries well almost no worriesben goertzel is founder and ceo of singularitynet a blockchainbased ai marketplace and appears in ashley and sahota’s book“the smarter these ais and robots get” goertzel recently said “the more controversial things are likely to get — but this is also where the greatest benefit for humans and other sentient beings is going to lie”sahota points out we can look at the future with optimism or pessimism sahota chooses optimism“as ai becomes increasingly adept at acquiring and analyzing vast amounts of data” ashley and sahota write “it is likely to exponentially accelerate the speed of technological change“according to experts ai may in a single generation produce more technological breakthroughs than humankind has managed during the first 20000 years of its existence”ashley’s favorite ai movie is “her” a sweet 2013 film with scarlett johansson voicing

undergraduate computer science major andrew beam had mapped out his professional life make it big in silicon valley as a systems engineer for a software giant but in his junior year he took an artificial intelligence course and his direction changed“it was the coolest thing—an awesome mix of philosophy mathematics and computer science” beam said “we pondered really fundamental questions about humanity and intelligence—everything to make an undergrad go ‘whoa dude’”while pursuing his doctorate in informatics he met a medical student who would become his wife watching her go through training beam had profound insights evidence is often outdated and physicians are overworked it can be difficult at times to reason under uncertainty or calculate probability and analyze statistics with confidence while under pressure“it was slapyouintheface obvious that ai was going to have a tremendous impact on health care” he saidtoday beam is an instructor in biomedical informatics at harvard medical school where he develops datadriven models that will improve decision making in health care although his current focus is neonatal and perinatal medicine—his wife kristyn beam is clinical fellow in neonatology at brigham and women’s hospital—the unifying theme of beam’s work is creating ai systems capable of making sense of the avalanche of data spawned by research in a variety of clinical specialties over the past 20 yearsat the top of beam’s todo list develop an artificial neural network capable of performing on a par with a secondyear medical student the longterm goal of this protomedstudent project funded by the robert wood johnson foundation is to evolve the system to the diagnostic level of a fourthyear medical student and make it capable of analyzing clinical scenarios and applying clinical reasoning“there is great promise and great enthusiasm in the field of medical ai but also a great deal of trepidation about how to harness its promise while avoiding potential pitfalls of which there are many” said isaac kohane chair of the department of biomedical informatics and the marion v nelson professor of biomedical informaticsyet early indicators are promising recent research demonstrated that diagnostic algorithms successfully used a constellation of telltale features in digital images of patients’ retinas to spot diabetic retinopathy as well as or even better than ophthalmologists could“what ai is going to allow us to do—if we do it right—is enhance the accuracy and productivity of clinicians by serving as a focusedintelligence assistance or backup” kohane said “but the need for the physician as a holistic thinker who understands both the medicine and the complexity of human life will never go away”read the 2018 2019 deans report25

to its customers aligned with our goal above we are conducting research in broad thematic areas such as ai core algorithms ondevice ai nextgeneration virtual assistant platform and so oncurrent deep learning algorithms although extremely powerful are limited in several ways these algorithms require large amounts of data struggle with learning from a continuous inflow of data and cannot easily handle multimodal data to address these issues samsung research is developing new methods at the intersection of vision language and machine learning with the goal of securing the world’s best core ai algorithmswe are looking into approaches such as bayesian deep learning for uncertainty modeling and probabilistic inference and reinforcement learning to enhance system performance based on user feedback and for autonomous control we are also working on automated machine learning automl to automate model search and performance tuning and generative adversarial networks gans to generate realistic scenes and to augment datamost of the current ai technologies depend on cloud services however to reduce latency ensure privacy and provide ai services anytime anywhere ondevice ai capability is needed ondevice ai has many challenges such as meeting power constraints ondevice learning requirements and model reduction and optimization in addition researchers need software development kits sdks and tool chains for ondevice ai development and deployment new algorithms and tools to meet these challenges are therefore continuously being developedfor this samsung research is researching technology for designing neural processors for hardware acceleration making models light enough to be applied to all samsung products and for software accelerationdigital assistants have recently been more widely applied to various products and machines such as smart speakers smart displays and home robots further multimodal assistants followed by proactive assistants are forecast to evolve in the future from the current voicebased assistants samsung research is developing a comprehensive virtual assistant platform as a highly personalized multidevice ecosystem to transform and empower people’s daily lives its plan is to realize a “virtual assistant that optimally works smartly understands and interacts like a friend in various products anytime anywhere”the goal of this project is to allow the agents to understand human dialog through voice recognition to carry on natural conversations to answer questions to translate and interpret various languages and to generate realistic speech through voice synthesis as a result users will get to enjoy the seamless provision of desired services at ease with any device in all aspects of daily livessamsung research has established a total of seven global ai centers in five countries namely korea seoul the united kingdom cambridge canada toronto and montreal russia moscow and the united states silicon valley and new york they will contribute to samsung’s ai research with their unique regional strengths and the ai technologies developed from these centers are being adopted in samsung products and

concepts three were field tested only speedgate surviveda mix of rugby soccer croquet football and field hockey the game is “fun fast and physical relying heavily on teamwork and passing to score and win” according to the sport’s websitespeedgate’s rules are simple players team up in two groups of six and try to kick or pass the ball into a gate at either end of the fieldbut remember you’ll need to keep the ball moving every three seconds and you cannot cross a circle in the middle of the fieldteams earn two points by kicking the ball through the gates at either end or three points for ricocheting the ball through the gatea full set of rules—as well as instructions on how to start your own league—are available onlineakqa also trained their networks on 10400 logos to develop the official speedgate emblem which frankly is less interesting than the game’s mascot a robot carrying a ball and pennant“using ai as a member of a creative team takes us to a new place that we never could have gotten to without it” akqa creative director whitney jenkins said in a statementartificial intelligence is even responsible for the sport’s somewhat sluggish motto “face the ball to be the ball to be above the ball”akqa demonstrated speedgate at an event in portland last week the company is reportedly in talks with the oregon sports authority to launch an intramural league this
