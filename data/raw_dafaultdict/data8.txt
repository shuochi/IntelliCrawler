problems in polynomial time by exploiting knowledge about the problem domain“ elaine richslide 3 although artificial intelligence as an independent field of study is relatively new it has some roots in the past we can say that it started 2400 years ago when the greek philosopher aristotle invented the concept of logical reasoning the effort to finalize the language of logic continued with leibniz and newton george boole developed boolean algebra in the nineteenth century appendix e that laid the foundation of computer circuits however the main idea of a thinking machine came from alan turing who proposed the turing test the term “artificial intelligence” was first coined by john mccarthy in 1956 history of artificial intelligenceslide 4 we end up with four possible goals systems that think like humans focus on reasoning and human framework systems that think rationally focus on reasoning and a general concept of intelligence systems that act like humans focus on behavior and human framework systems that act rationally focus on behavior and a general concept of intelligenceslide 5 computers were solving word problems in algebra proving logical theorems and speaking english by the middle of the 1960s research in the us was heavily funded by the department of defense and laboratories had been established around the world ais founders were profoundly optimistic about the future of the new field herbert simon predicted that machines will be capable within twenty years of doing any work a man can do and marvin minsky agreed writing that within a generation the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solvedslide 6 intelligent agents intelligent agents can be divided into two broad categories software agents and physical agentsslide 7 software agents a software agent is a set of programs that are designed to do particular tasks they works with limitation physical agents a physical agent robot is a programmable system that can be used to perform a variety of tasks simple robots can be used in manufacturing to do routine jobs such as assembling welding or painting some organizations use mobile robots that do routine delivery jobs such as distributing mail or correspondence to different roomsslide 8 applications of ai game playing most games are played using a welldefined set of rules this makes it easy to generate the search space and frees the researcher from many of the ambiguities and complexities inherent in less structured problems automated reasoning theorem proving theorem proffers function as intelligent assistants letting human perform the more demanding tasks of decomposing a large problem into sub problems and devising heuristics for searching the space of possible proofs expert systems expert knowledge is a combination of a theoretical understanding of the problem and a collection of heuristic problem solving rules that experience has shown to be effective in the domain expert system are constructed by obtaining this knowledge from a human expert and coding it into a form that a computer may apply to similar problemsslide 9 natural language understanding semantic modeling one of the longstanding goals of artificial intelligence is the creation of programs that are capable of understanding human language not only does the ability to understand natural language seem to be one of the most fundamental aspects of human intelligence but also it successful automation would have an incredible impact on the usability and effectiveness of computer them selves planning robotics planning is an important aspect of the effort to design robots that perform their task with some degree of flexibility and responsiveness to the outside world briefly planning assumes a robot that is capable of performing certain atomic actions it attempts to find a sequence of those action that will accomplish some higherlevel task such as moving a cross an obstaclefilled room machine learning the ability to learn is one of the most important components of intelligent behavior an expert system may perform extensive and costly computations to solve a problem applications of aislide 10 knowledge is the symbolic representation of aspect of some named universe of discourse data is the symbolic representation of simple aspects of some named universe of discourse information the useful contents of knowledgeslide 11 many hollywood movies come with the future technology that technology we can see in our future have a look some of them… in this movie people to purchase remote controlled humanoid robots through which they interact with society these fit attractive remotely controlled robots ultimately assume their life roles enabling people to experience life vicariously from the comfort and safety of their own homes alex robocop at first rejects his current condition upon seeing that his original body now consists of only lungs throat head and right hand when the armor and cybernetic components are fully removed but he is convinced by norton to be strong for his wife and son he had loose his body parts in a car bomb blast alex has him outfitted with the cybernetic body and softwareslide 12 the robots are coming to steal our jobsslide 13 thank you'})

living two decades ago in 2017 its quite impossible for you to not be aware of the development of artificial intelligenceno matter how controversial or doubtful it may be this technological advancement towards smarter artificial intelligence is pretty much the present and definitely the future of mankindwith the rise of new tools such as deep learning machine learning reinforced learning supervised and unsupervised learning neural networks and bayesian network the world of computing and machinedriven manufacturing is changing the world as we know itin such a time when the future of humanity is uncertain with the development of machines more intelligent than ourselves we must at least have a clear understanding of whats going to change our world in the near futureif you google the term youll know that artificial intelligence is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence such as visual perception speech recognition decisionmaking and translation between languagesintelligence is hard to define and it gets trickier in the case of artificial intelligence or ai it is true that an ai is a manmade machine with decisionmaking capabilities but it still cannot fathom the way a human mind works taking all relevant factors into accountwith the arrival of ai we have encountered some of the most fundamental queries of the human mind — what is consciousness what makes us different from an aihere let us clarify that robots are not necessarily ais robots can be programmed with codes that turn it into an ai bot but theres a huge gap between the two vastly different entitiesai is a software that replicates intelligence and performs certain tasks in an optimum way by considering all relevant factors whereas robots are physical entities that may or may not carry an ai enginerobots are not necessarily aisits like water and glass — the glass itself holds different value than the water but they both can come together to serve a particular purposethe term artificial intelligence was coined by john mccarthy in 1956 back then it was a much simpler form of a logicbased system but as we have progressed so has the technology and the definition of ainow systems that analyze and find patterns in data is considered the most prominent and common form of artificial intelligence and many international companies have incorporated the system into their work processaccording to their level of intelligence and capabilities developers have marked three distinct categories for artificial intelligence ai — narrow general and superlimited to only specific tasks – this is the perfect way to describe artificial narrow intelligence or ani this type of ai can very easily learn patterns in the data provided to itwith computer vision and language processing the narrow ai can play chess make shopping suggestions investment preferences sales prediction weather forecast and such patternbased activitiesit is also called weak ai but do not let that coinage fool you the ani is the machine that drives google translate which is one of the most sophisticated digital platforms quite recently googles alphago powered by deepmind beat go champion lee sedol watch the match below with ease selfdriving cars also run on ani or a collection of synchronized anisthe next big step in the world of ai would be to achieve general or humanlevel ai this type of artificial intelligence can observe analyze and react to its surroundings like a human for decades programmers have been working on creating this elusive machinerytermed as artificial general intelligence or agi this technology is pushing scientists to the edge of their knowledge as they are finding it extremely difficult to quantify human intelligence and replicate it via codesthere is another limitation to the development of agi the human mind is highly adaptive it can think abstractly and be innovative by these virtues the human brain can invent something that wasnt there before its highly difficult to teach something that we invented to invent things on its ownthis is the new frontier of ai technology artificial super intelligence is a more distant idea than a reality as for now it is as university of oxford scholar and ai expert nick bostrom puts it when ai becomes much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field including scientific creativity general wisdom and social skillsa singular element that would hold all information and a better understanding about the universe and its elements than the humans definitely sounds like something out of a contemporary scifi novel or a marvel moviehowever the line between artificial general intelligence and super intelligence is quite thin and many scientists believe that itd take only months or even minutes to introduce superintelligence to an agi and itll continue gathering analyzing and reacting to information at a light speed towards no endlegendary physicist stephen hawking believes that such a sentient system would mean the end of humanity as we know it as a more advanced species would gradually overpower the inferior ones – in this case the human – and either enslave it or destroy it completelycelebrated innovator and owner of tesla and spacex elon musk has also expressed great concern over the future development of such superintelligent systemsampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampltspan idselectionmarker1

the other end there are other scientists such as google’s demis hassabis believes that such a smart ai would be able to help mankind to solve some crucial issues like climate change cure to cancer and other fatal diseases and space exploration“i don’t care so much whether what we are building is real intelligence” says peter norvig director of research at google “we know how to build real intelligence—my wife and i did it twice although she did a lot more of the work we don’t need to duplicate humans that’s why i focus on having tools to help us rather than duplicate what we already know how to do we want humans and machines to partner and do something that they cannot do on their own”i focus on having tools to help us rather than duplicate what we already know how to do — peter norvig director of research at googlefuture is the culmination of what we decide to do now with global issues such as climate change rising sea level nuclear threats and medical ailments like cancer humanity needs a push to move on as a speciesthe digital revolution that happened with the advent of the internet is history now the next big step would be a breakthrough in the development of advanced artificial intelligence but it would also need us to find the answer to the ultimate question — what is consciousnessis there a serious chance of ais becoming more powerful and knowledgeable

'h3': 'malevolent aiai rightsread more from this seriesartificial intelligenceleave a reply cancel reply', 'p': 'last week we covered the past and current state of artificial intelligence — what modern ai looks like the differences between weak and strong ai agi and some of the philosophical ideas about what constitutes consciousness weak ai is already all around us in the form of software dedicated to performing specific tasks intelligently strong ai is the ultimate goal and a true strong ai would resemble what most of us have grown familiar with through popular fictionartificial general intelligence agi is a modern goal many ai researchers are currently devoting their careers to in an effort to bridge that gap while agi wouldn’t necessarily possess any kind of consciousness it would be able to handle any datarelated task put before it of course as humans it’s in our nature to try to forecast the future and that’s what we’ll be talking about in this article what are some of our best guesses about what we can expect from ai in the future near and far what possible ethical and practical concerns are there if a conscious ai were to be created in this speculative future should an ai have rights or should it be fearedthe optimism among ai researchers about the future has changed over the years and is strongly debated even among contemporary experts trevor sands introduced in the previous article as an ai researcher for lockheed martin who stresses that his statements reflect his own opinions and not necessarily those of his employer has a guarded opinion he puts it thuslyever since agi has existed as a concept researchers and optimists alike have maintained that it’s ‘just around the corner’ a few decades away personally i believe we will see agi emerge within the next halfcentury as hardware has caught up with theory and more enterprises are seeing the potential in advances in ai agi is the natural conclusion of ongoing efforts in researching aieven sentient ai might be possible in that timeframe as albert another ai researcher who asked us to use a pseudonym for this article saysi hope to see it in my lifetime i at least expect to see machine intelligence enough that people will strongly argue about whether or not they are ‘sentient’ what this actually means is a much harder question if sentience means ‘selfaware’ then it doesn’t actually seem that hard to imagine an intelligent machine that could have a model of itselfboth sands and albert believe that the current research into neural networks and deep learning is the right path and will likely lead to the development of agi in the nottoofar future in the past research has either been focused on ambitious strong ai or weak ai that is limited in scope the middle ground of agi and specifically that being performed by neural networks seems to be fruitful so far and is likely to lead to even more advancement in the coming years large companies like google certainly think this is the casewhenever ai is discussed two major issues always come up how will it affect humanity and how should it we treat it works of fiction are always a good indicator of the thoughts and feelings the general population has and examples of these questions abound in science fiction will a sufficiently advanced ai try to eliminate humanity a la skynet or will ai need to be afforded rights and protection to avoid atrocities like those envisioned in ai artificial intelligencein both of these scenarios a common theme is that of a technological singularity arises from the creation of true artificial intelligence a technological singularity is defined as a period of exponential advancement happening in a very short amount of time the idea is that an ai would be capable of either improving itself or producing more advanced ais because this would happen quickly a dramatic advancements could happen essentially overnight resulting in an ai far more advanced than what was originally created by humanity this might mean we’d end up with a super intelligent malevolent ai or an ai which was conscious and deserving of rightswhat if this hypothetical super intelligent ai decided that it didn’t like humanity or was simply indifferent to us should we fear this possibility and take precautions to prevent it or are these fears simply the result of unfounded paranoiasands hypothesizes “agi will revolutionize humanity its application determines if this is going to be a positive or negative impact this is much in the same way that ‘splitting the atom’ is seen as a doubleedged sword” of course this is only in regards to agi — not strong ai what about the possibility of a sentient conscious strong aiit’s more likely that potential won’t come from a malevolent ai but rather an indifferent one albert poses the question of an ai given a seemingly simple task “the story goes that you are the owner of a paper clip factory so you ask the agi to maximize the production of paper clips the agi then uses its superior intelligence to work out a way to turn the entire planet into paper clips”while an amusing thought experiment albert dismisses this idea “you’re telling me that this agi can understand human language is super intelligent but doesn’t quite get the subtleties of the request or that it wouldn’t be capable of asking for a clarification or guessing that turning all the humans into paperclips is a bad idea”basically if the ai were intelligent enough to understand and execute a scenario that were harmful to humans it should also be smart enough to know not to do it asimov’s three laws of robotics could also play a role here though it’s questionable whether those could be implemented in a way that the ai wasn’t capable of changing them but what about the welfare of the ai itselfon the opposite side of the argument is whether artificial intelligence is deserving of protection and rights if a sentient and conscious ai were created should we be allowed to simply turn it off how should such an entity be treated animal rights are a controversial issue even now and so far there is no agreement about whether any animals possess consciousness or even sentienceit follows that this same debate would also apply to artificially intelligent beings is it slavery to force the ai to work day and night for humanity’s benefit should we pay it for its services what would an ai even do with that paymentit’s unlikely we’ll have answers to these questions anytime soon especially not answers that will satisfy everyone “a convincing moral objection to agi is how do we guarantee that an artificial intelligence onpar with a human has the same rights as a human given that this intelligent system is fundamentally different from a human how do we define fundamental ai rights additionally if we consider an artificial intelligence as an artificial lifeform do we have the right to take its life ‘turn it off’ before we arrive at agi we should be seriously thinking about the ethics of ai” says sandsthese questions of ethics and many others are sure to be a continuing point of debate as ai research continues by all accounts we’re a long way away from them being relevant but even now conferences are being held to discuss these issuesartificial intelligence research and experimentation has traditionally been the domain of academics and researchers working in corporate labs but in recent years the rising popularity of free information and the open source movement has spread even to ai if you’re interested in getting involved with the future of artificial there are a number of ways you can do soif you’d like to do some experimenting with neural networks yourself there is software available to do so google has an inbrowser playground for tinkering with basic neural network techniques open source neural network libraries like opennn and tensorflow are freely available while these aren’t exactly easy to use determined hobbyists can use them and expand upon themthe best way to get involved however is by doing what you can to further professional research in the us this means activism to promote the funding of scientific research ai research like all scientific research is in a precarious position for those who believe technological innovation is the future the push for public funding of research is always a worthy endeavorover the years the general optimism surrounding the development of artificial intelligence has fluctuated we’re at a high point right now but it’s entirely possible that might change but what’s undeniable is how the possibility of ai stirs the imagination of the public this is evident in the science fiction and entertainment we consume we may have strong ai in a couple of years or it might take a couple of centuries what’s certain is that we’re unlikely to ever give up on the pursuitinstead of strong ai and weak ai how about ai and not airecursive selfimprovement is pretty much impossible to develop on a machine machines have no self and improvements are very subjective in nature sometimes destroying a system of logic altogether can be an improvement yet destruction at the same timeto quote tyler durden “self improvement is masturbation” there are many contexts at which this expression can break down the premise of aii think at best we will have turing complete lovebots and autonomous machines to perform tasks in dangerous environments where communications are not possible or practical the form of “weak ai” is best refered to as continuous process automation calling current implementations of process automation ai is about as cringeworthy as when map developers were calling their map making algorithms airecursive selfimprovement is pretty much impossible to develop on a machineisn’t machine learning a form of recursive selfimprovement the thing that is often missing is a way to measure “improvement” if that is part of the system then it closes the loop and a machine has the necessary information to judge if changes are better or not betterit surely is1 what it learns is dependent on whathow it is programmed to learn 2 whether it “improves” itself on that learning depends on what it happens to learn ie its improvement is dependent on what information you give it even if by chanceyou can’t program a program to systematically selfimprove because if you knew how exactly improvement happens you could skip all that bother and just program it better in the first place if you already know how to arrive at the solution you don’t need the ai to do itthe selflearning ai is a bit of a semantics trick that many people in the ai research community like to pull when they describe what they’re doing for example when they teach asimo to tell the difference of a toy car by verbally repeating “toy car” when the robot is imaging the car the robot learns the cue then the researchers imply that the robot understands that it’s a toy car but all they’ve really done is give it an arbitrary label for arbitrary data and programmed it to repeat the label on cue they might as well have typed the information in to the database manually the robot hasn’t learned anything – they’ve just managed to build a new type of programming “user interface” and a routine to enter data which happens to mimic some of the outward behaviour of people when they discover new objectsalphago improved itself and none of the programmers could have implemented the result directlyof course because none of the programmers have a personal capacity to analyze millions and millions of prerecorded games and then play against themselves to test all the strategies unveiledwhen you run the algorithms and ferry the data between the steps from analysis to implementation “manually” it’s not called intelligent when you automate the steps to a script so the researchers can go “look no hands” it gets called aithat’s the pointor to use the other point what if the training set for the program consisted of amateurs who didn’t know how to play would the program still improve to beat the masterthe idea of systematic selfimprovement is implying that the program can start from some arbitrary data and then improve upon improvement upon improvement until it becomes the best in everything the reduction ad absurdum of the idea is to give the program the letter “a” and expect it to eventually come up with“now fair hippolyta our nuptial hour draws on apace four happy days bring in another moon but o methinks how slow…”alphago is analyzing billions of games and build a classification model of what position leads to victory and what position leads to failure that has nothing to do with intelligence in the usual sense of the worddax you are giving the human the implicit advantage of multiple interconnected senses all working simultaneouslyso far we have “ai” that just take one small component in isolation siri may use a neural network to recognize a specific word from a stream of a recording of human speech but after that it is just a simple preprogrammed search through a glossary to find the command that goes with that wordthe baby is learning both the word and the object as subjective experiences which have meaning to the baby – it also has to learn that repeating the word back is meaningful the computer is merely preprogrammed to recognize spoken words and take photos on commandthe whole point of a true strong ai is that it is is not preprogrammed to recognize spoken words or do anything on commandif the computer starts at the same point as the baby it can reach the same resultthis would mean a system capable of analyzing sound generating sound and relating the causeeffect of what it says to what it hearsthis is the same learning process for a human beeing to teach a baby what a “toy car” is show one to him and repeat “car” then is brain make the association between the object it sees and the sound it hear at the same time and this assiocation is different dependant of the language used our brain is nothing more than an assiociative network the only diffenrence with an ai reside in its complexity which result from the huge number of neurones and very very huge number of synapses connections between neurones there may be as much as 1000 synapses per neurone httpwwwmadsciorgpostsarchives2003031046827391nsrhtmlhave your ever obversed this fact you repeat the word “dad” to a baby until he repeat it but at first he repeat the word when he sees any man then you have to teach him that “dad” refer to a specific man not any man his brain make a refinement in the assiociationnot quite it’s only superfically the same the baby is learning both the word and the object as subjective experiences which have meaning to the baby – it also has to learn that repeating the word back is meaningful the computer is merely preprogrammed to recognize spoken words and take photos on command upon command it simply stores the photo or a computed representation of the target in frame under the dictated category “toy car” on another command to identify a presented object it takes another photo and does a compare match for the data it has stored and returns the name of the category that it was previously commanded to create “toy car”this is perfectly analogous to sitting down to a computer creating a file named “toycartxt” and storing the word “red” in it here the word “red” represents the data that the robot is instructed to collect with its camera then you search for all the text files that contain the word “red” and list them the computer says “toycartxt” the whole process is only made complicated by having to voice the commands to the speechtotext converter in the robot – and this complicated charade looks enough like a baby learning a new word so the people involved pretend that it is the same thing it isn’t”the only diffenrence with an ai reside in its complexity which result from the huge number of neurones and very very huge number of synapses ”that idea is resting on the notion that the brain is a classical system so the networks can be represented as a computer program given enough processing power while in reality there’s mounting evidence that brains are not classical computershttpsphysorgnews201702androidsquantumsheephtml ”the team investigated ‘inputoutput processes’ assessing the mathematical framework used to describe arbitrary devices that make future decisions based on stimuli received from the environment in almost all cases they found a quantum device is more efficient because classical devices have to store more past information than is necessary to simulate the future”more of the same article”coauthor jayne thompson a research fellow at cqt explains further “classical systems always have a definitive reality they need to retain enough information to respond correctly to each possible future stimulus by engineering a quantum device so that different inputs are like different quantum measurements we can replicate the same behaviour without retaining a complete description of how to respond to each individual question””that’s describing exactly the problem that classical ai has with trying to percieve the world around it it needs to be in a definite state you can give it a million pictures of things to come up with some “invariant representation” but it doesn’t work because reality is just so full of special cases and exceptions you train it with a million pictures of an umbrella in various colors shapes sizes different lighting conditions… and then someone comes out of the woods carrying a huge rhubarb leaf over their head the computer goes “err…”or another case when is this a stool and when is it a very small coffee table if you turn it upside down at what point does it stop being a stooltable and start begin being a rubber boot drying rackhttpwwwstoolsonlinecoukshopimagesthumbstrubberwoodstool2402244ffjpgpeople don’t need to decide because we don’t fundamentally operate on rigid categories of what things aremachines do not learn they process information and relay it to an observer independent of an observer they are purely making calculations while yes human minds process information in ways not so far apart from the calculators calculators are a construct of human innovation humans can learn independent of the observations of others in current scenarios humans are the ones learning the silicon wafers are as dumb as ever maybe a few electrons heavierai doesn’t need to resemble the human thought process with all of its imperfections either in some cases selflessness is beneficial nature gave our bodies an arsenal of tools for survival that computers simply do not need intelligence could be silly in it’s own respect as a pursuit for a machine to improve perhaps no thought is necessary“recursive selfimprovement is pretty much impossible to develop on a machine”have you ever heard of genetic algorithmhttpsenwikipediaorgwikigeneticalgorithmthose work when you already know what “better” isselfimprovement in the sense of general ai doesn’t afford you that information or at the very least you have to impose a “better” on the machine to strive towards which would mean it wouldn’t do what you didn’t ask of it – it would do exactly as programmed and no more because you set the end goal and the criteriait wouldn’t be self improvement because it’s not the ai that sets the goalsmost people don’t set their own goals either if an ai can do just as well as those people i’ll consider it a great successmost people choose not to choose that’s still a choiceat any moment you could say strip off your clothes and jump out the window – plummet do your death that’s within the realm of possibility for a human being not so for the “ai”“at any moment you could say strip off your clothes and jump out the window”no i couldn’t i have no desire to do that and i have no idea how to change that desire”no i couldn’t i have no desire to do that and i have no idea how to change that desire”that’s missing the point the program doesn’t deviate from its programming – it’s not possible that it would ever come up with the idea of solving a problem by “i’ll jump out the window” because it’s a complete nonsequitur from its software – it can’t make the leap of imagination unless the hardware is seriously broken or you deliberately add a random number generator that has a chance to make the machine suicidalmeanwhile it’s perfectly ordinary for people to be crazy to do the crazy perhaps because sometimes it turns out to make sensethe guy who invented beam bots put the idea something like this “brains are trying to make order out of chaos while ai researchers are trying to make chaos out of order” – chaos being the random nature of nature rather than the mathematical definition of it it’s perfectly obvious that it only really works one way“the program doesn’t deviate from its programming – it’s not possible that it would ever come up with the idea of solving a problem by “i’ll jump out the window” because it’s a complete nonsequitur from its software ”you’re missing the point i’m also programmed to not jump from windows and i’m not deviating from that programming eitherthe way you defend humain brain sound like there is something magic in it on the contrary i think there is nothing magic in the working of our brain it’s feat is only a consequence of the quantitive complexity when we will have the hardware to build neural nets with billions of nodes and trillions of interconnexions between them we will get the same complexity as our brainan ant has 250000 neurons 400000 times less than a human and still we can’t do that with computers i am still waiting for some convincing video showing robots doing something remotely comparable to an army of ants building an anthive autonomouslynice cardigan sis what to buy a turing complete seashellhttpartfailcomautomataimgpaperrule30shelljpgwant to buy…the fact is we cannot come to a consensus regarding consciousness either our own or that of artificial intelligences we simply do not have the data required to define it until such time as we do ethical issues are at best mootthe other problem i almost never see discussed is that a truly cognitive ai may not be that useful to those that made it if indeed it suffers from the same limitations as human cognition – the power of machines is that they are strong in the places where we are weak maybe instead of looking to promote a machine to selfawareness via ai artificial intelligence we should be looking to ia intelligence amplification for ourselveswhenever i hear a term that is “impossible to define” but “intuitively obvious” i suspect it’s just an illusion used to explain away some of our questionable behaviors i wouldn’t be surprised at all if it turned out that we simply call “conscious” anything that activates our empathy circuits and the term is otherwise devoid of meaningi don’t contend that consciousness is impossible to define in fact i don’t even think it is all that intuitively obvious given issues with determining if it is there in other animals what i am asserting is that we have very little hard data to formulate a meaningful definition of the concept such that it can be applied to decide if a machine is manifesting iti agree with dassheep it is our emphaty or lack of it that will determine our behaviour toward ai like it is with our pets so the question of consciouness is secondarythe question of consciousness is not secondary in fact it will likely be the single most important question as we determine how these things will fit into our society no one disputes a human’s right to exert ownership over the code and hardware of a chatbot i’m not so sure we could allow the same for a hard ai and that argument will not turn on empathy but will depend on establishing the technical bounds of selfawarenessthere’s no way you will be able to define consciousness in a meaningful way nor is it the case that consciousness automatically grants certain rights rights are something you have to earn either by being cute and fuzzy or by forcewhy would the question of ownership and rights have to be tied to consciousness because it’s the last thing that we are unable to fake but there are many things in our culture that you can’t own even though they are not conscious for example you can’t own a hurricane — even if you produce one artificially somehow weather seems to have stayed immune to capitalism somehow and the idea of owning a cloud is still as alien as the idea of owning land used to be before the agricultural revolutionyet we insist that it exists even though we don’t even know what it is that doesn’t happen with most terms in our language even if they are as abstract as “truth” or “justice” with consciousness however we are absolutely sure that it exists and that in particular we have it yet we are unable to even tell what it is and how to recognize it this smells like a hardwired hack inside our brains that forces a beliefor it could be a consequence of the essential selfreferential subjective nature of the experience of consciousness either way it is not possible to assert its existence in any other context without better definitions which in turn need to be based on better dataour brain is too complex for us to understand whoever studied the control theory knows that even systems with only 2 feedback loops are difficult to understand and here we are trying to emulate a system with probably millions of feedback loopsonly way to make any progress at all is to start from the lowest levels from animals with only few neurons and construct from there some serious scientists are doing just that everything else is just a pipe dream or getquickfundingonthelatestbuzzword schemecurrently we cannot even emulate a functional fruitfly brain with our level of misunderstandingour brains have evolved from smaller ape brains in a million generations without anybody understanding how millions of feedback loops are put together if we understand a bunch of key details we could evolve an artificial brain in a similar way without actually understanding how the whole thing worksconsidering the success of deep learning one can’t consider it only as a “buzzword” the fruits of deeplearning research are already available since google is using a deeplearning engine to translate between frenchenglish i notice a big improvementthere is a better way you can get involved you can try and support the efforts to avoid malevolent ai like the stuff that eliezer yudkowsky doessomewhat relevant video httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdlrlypiaaoai always thought that asimov’s idea described in the final story “the evitable conflict” in “i robot” was an interesting take on ai the robots computers ended up essentially running things because that was the logical outgrowth of their programming to do no harm to humans but they did it in a way that didn’t harm human egos the humans didn’t know they were ruled by the machines and the machines made sure that overall humans had a pretty good existenceas long we’re not understanding of the why of religions ethics in ai will be difficult to define that why i’m calling myself a paratheist opposed to the book theist i’m asking how is god defined with the purpose to teach a future ai not turning malevolent seeing the actual religious madness being an atheist is not enough and could it be that neural or any network is god from the ants to the simulated nn worm up to human interactions which leaded to society and finally ethics this schema could be understood as such hope and believing are future based construct that keep us humans alive and don’t turn us malevolent too and perhaps ai will need something utopic a never provable thing like gods just to keep it runningwatch the progress made in the last year it’s amazing and it’s progression speed gets exponential like when ai gets creative youtube httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvoitgrdhfnwww560h3155d“works of fiction are always a good indicator of the thoughts and feelings the general population has”what no they aren’tthese works are generally what a few humans think will entertain other humans in a profitable wayif you don’t believe in artificial intelligence simply observe how many and with what passion all of the artificial intelligentia weigh in on the subject when presented with the most miniscule of opportunities and reason“asking if computers can think is the same as asking if submarines can swim”–edsger djikstra“i have found that the reason a lot of people are interested in artificial intelligence is the same reason a lot of people are interested in artificial limbs they are missing one”–david l parnasartificial intelligence lack of upper case absolutely intended it should be used under no circumstances has fallen into the same disrepute as has weird water fuzzy logic cold fusion ear candling homeopathy perpetualmotion machines noenergy plasma rockets and all other pseudosciences and paraphysics which one can think of–and a lot which can’t even be imaginedbefore you pseudoscientists and technobabbleists get out your flamethrowers pick the ten topranked schools in the world which teach computer science and which are held in the highest esteem by the worldwide scientific and engineering community now write to them asking them to tell you in very explicit terms the high regard and importance in which they hold artificial intelligence research please include these responses in your replieswe’ll all be waitingwhat they all would probably direct you to their labs which are led by reputable scientists amply funded and produce scholarly work to support continued funding and technological development it looks like many also have coursework for training future engineers to work on these softwaresystems tooai more than brunette hair dye”the idea is that an ai would be capable of either improving itself or producing more advanced ais because this would happen quickly a dramatic advancements could happen essentially overnight”all the different ideas of a technological singularity omit to say where the energy and material resources to perform them would come from and it’s assuming there are no hard problems that can’t be solved by throwing more hardware at the issue and the ai can just conjure up knowledge out of nothing without taking time to physically explore its environmentex nihilo nihil fitso the aim is to create something in our own image but does what we want… but thinks for itself… but fits in… but has free will… we tried with pets we tried with kids we tried with people at work and we can’t get it right machines for sure…to get a sentient ai going you need to put in two things a set of drives and a set of limitations i’m waiting for someone to figure that outwell said sir well said the only problem is time few million years perhapsyou can’t stop malevolent ai if it interacts with the real world it is either true ai and it thinks for itself or it isn’t we can’t even reliably make benign natural intelligence ie humane humans if we think for ourselves we can do great good or harm and if we don’t think for ourselves we almost always allow others to do great harmfurthermore if an ai is self improving it would be subject to some form of unnatural selection and that is essentially a random process that is only directed by the fact that some variations enhance competence therefore it is just as likely to evolve into something that benefits itself at the expense of humanity the concept of an enlightened mind natural or artificial is entirely subjective and context dependant therefore there is no vector that an ai’s evolution would follow that ensures that we benefit the entire idea of “goodness” is an illusion at best we can form a consensus as to what behaviours we condone but even that falls apart when we subject the abstract principles to realworld scenarios assuming you can get everyone to agree on anything and when was the last time the un behaved in a remotely coherent manner human culture is only a singular thing if you say it is all of the conflicting ideas of our species in reality humans live in a cluster of overlapping realities as far as their mind’s are configured “but but science” you cry ah yes and how many people even fully understand and subscribe to that idea ethics is like history ultimately the views of the victor and not some ideal truth that is beyond and above human frailtythe only safe strong ai is one that lives in a sandbox world and has no way of directly interacting with the real world it has to live in it’s own little universe and we have to play “god” over itwell a lot of physicists believe we are living inside a simulation…yup i was going to mention that but it is a secondary issue though very profound if it is true it is probably just as wellsince you are responsible for broaching the subject you are also responsible for following through on your claim that “…a lot of physicists believe we are living inside a simulation…” a list of at least ten worldclass physicists will do nicely as a start one would think with one additional caveat any list which includes the name of elon musk or any other selfpromoting wannabe pseudotechnician–not a pseudoscientist nor even a pseudoengineer–is automatically and outofhand considered voiddeadly truth of general ai – computerphilehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtcdvc4e6ev4why asimov’s laws of robotics don’t work – computerphilehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv7pkx3ks7f4aai will replace us and when i see the sht humans do this may not even be a bad perspective… pone should add a further parameter to the drake formula chance of surviving after developing agi it could be very low which might explain fermi’s paradoxfermi’s paradox is already explained by the great distances between solar systems preventing both travel and straightforward communication for example our tv transmissions are already very challenging to pick up from orbit of pluto let alone from 100 light years away and nearly all of the billions and billions of stars are much further awayheh quite possible on the other hand maybe agi is easy but interstellar travel is not i had some crazy idea that perhaps ftl messes up both organic and inorganic systems such that a starship would have to go “full steampunk” and use mechanical clockwork timers to drop inout of hyperspace could explain the lack of any signal an agi is going to figure this out early on and remain confined to its home system sending out the occasional “ping” on a radioquiet band determined by its own mechanisms perhaps 11024 ghz or in the optical band least affected by interstellar dust would be a good place to startgame over httpwwwzarzuelazencomcoreknowledgedomains2htmla different fictional perspective of ai posted by me on

'ol': 'sadhana says february 13 2017 at 727 am instead of strong ai and weak ai how about ai and not ai recursive selfimprovement is pretty much impossible to develop on a machine machines have no self and improvements are very subjective in nature sometimes destroying a system of logic altogether can be an improvement yet destruction at the same time to quote tyler durden “self improvement is masturbation” there are many contexts at which this expression can break down the premise of ai i think at best we will have turing complete lovebots and autonomous machines to perform tasks in dangerous environments where communications are not possible or practical the form of “weak ai” is best refered to as continuous process automation calling current implementations of process automation ai is about as cringeworthy as when map developers were calling their map making algorithms ai report comment reply mike szczys says february 13 2017 at 910 am recursive selfimprovement is pretty much impossible to develop on a machine isn’t machine learning a form of recursive selfimprovement the thing that is often missing is a way to measure “improvement” if that is part of the system then it closes the loop and a machine has the necessary information to judge if changes are better or not better report comment reply jacques1956 says february 13 2017 at 1039 am it surely is report comment reply dax says february 13 2017 at 1142 am 1 what it learns is dependent on whathow it is programmed to learn 2 whether it “improves” itself on that learning depends on what it happens to learn ie its improvement is dependent on what information you give it even if by chance you can’t program a program to systematically selfimprove because if you knew how exactly improvement happens you could skip all that bother and just program it better in the first place if you already know how to arrive at the solution you don’t need the ai to do it the selflearning ai is a bit of a semantics trick that many people in the ai research community like to pull when they describe what they’re doing for example when they teach asimo to tell the difference of a toy car by verbally repeating “toy car” when the robot is imaging the car the robot learns the cue then the researchers imply that the robot understands that it’s a toy car but all they’ve really done is give it an arbitrary label for arbitrary data and programmed it to repeat the label on cue they might as well have typed the information in to the database manually the robot hasn’t learned anything – they’ve just managed to build a new type of programming “user interface” and a routine to enter data which happens to mimic some of the outward behaviour of people when they discover new objects report comment reply artenz says february 13 2017 at 1148 am alphago improved itself and none of the programmers could have implemented the result directly report comment reply dax says february 13 2017 at

go “look no hands” it gets called ai that’s the point report comment dax says february 13 2017 at 1230 pm or to use the other point what if the training set for the program consisted of amateurs who didn’t know how to play would the program still improve to beat the master the idea of systematic selfimprovement is implying that the program can start from some arbitrary data and then improve upon improvement upon improvement until it becomes the best in everything the reduction ad absurdum of the idea is to give the program the letter “a” and expect it to eventually come up with “now fair hippolyta our nuptial hour draws on apace four happy days bring in another moon but o methinks how slow…” report comment haltux says february 13 2017 at 217 pm alphago is analyzing billions of games and build a classification model of what position leads to victory and what position leads to failure that has nothing to do with intelligence in the usual sense of the word report comment s says february 14 2017 at 1141 am dax you are giving the human the implicit advantage of multiple interconnected senses all working simultaneously so far we have “ai” that just take one small component in isolation siri may use a neural network to recognize a specific word from a stream of a recording of human speech but after that it is just a simple preprogrammed search through a glossary to find the command that goes with that word the baby is learning both the word and the object as subjective experiences which have meaning to the baby – it also has to learn that repeating the word back is meaningful the computer is merely preprogrammed to recognize spoken words and take photos on command the whole point of a true strong ai is that it is is not preprogrammed to recognize spoken words or do anything on command if the computer starts at the same point as the baby it can reach the same result this would mean a system capable of analyzing sound generating sound and relating the causeeffect of what it says to what it hears report comment jacques1956 says february 13 2017 at 112 pm this is the same learning process for a human beeing to teach a baby what a “toy car” is show one to him and repeat “car” then is brain make the association between the object it sees and the sound it hear at the same time and this assiocation is different dependant of the language used our brain is nothing more than an assiociative network the only diffenrence with an ai reside in its complexity which result from the huge number of neurones and very very huge number of synapses connections between neurones there may be as much as 1000 synapses per neurone httpwwwmadsciorgpostsarchives2003031046827391nsrhtml have your ever obversed this fact you repeat the word “dad” to a baby until he repeat it but at first he repeat the word when he sees any man then you have to teach him that “dad” refer to a specific man not any man his brain make a refinement in the assiociation report comment reply dax says february 13 2017 at 357 pm not quite it’s only superfically the same the baby is learning both the word and the object as subjective experiences which have meaning to the baby – it also has to learn that repeating the word back is meaningful the computer is merely preprogrammed to recognize spoken words and take photos on command upon command it simply stores the photo or a computed representation of the target in frame under the dictated category “toy car” on another command to identify a presented object it takes another photo and does a compare match for the data it has stored and returns the name of the category that it was previously commanded to create “toy car” this is perfectly analogous to sitting down to a computer creating a file named “toycartxt” and storing the word “red” in it here the word “red” represents the data that the robot is instructed to collect with its camera then you search for all the text files that contain the word “red” and list them the computer says “toycartxt” the whole process is only made complicated by having to voice the commands to the speechtotext converter in the robot – and this complicated charade looks enough like a baby learning a new word so the people involved pretend that it is the same thing it isn’t ”the only diffenrence with an ai reside in its complexity which result from the huge number of neurones and very very huge number of synapses ” that idea is resting on the notion that the brain is a classical system so the networks can be represented as a computer program given enough processing power while in reality there’s mounting evidence that brains are not classical computers httpsphysorgnews201702androidsquantumsheephtml ”the team investigated ‘inputoutput processes’ assessing the mathematical framework used to describe arbitrary devices that make future decisions based on stimuli received from the environment in almost all cases they found a quantum device is more efficient because classical devices have to store more past information than is necessary to simulate the future” report comment dax says february 13 2017 at 440 pm more of the same article ”coauthor jayne thompson a research fellow at cqt explains further “classical systems always have a definitive reality they need to retain enough information to respond correctly to each possible future stimulus by engineering a quantum device so that different inputs are like different quantum measurements we can replicate the same behaviour without retaining a complete description of how to respond to each individual question”” that’s describing exactly the problem that classical ai has with trying to percieve the world around it it needs to be in a definite state you can give it a million pictures of things to come up with some “invariant representation” but it doesn’t work because reality is just so full of special cases and exceptions you train it with a million pictures of an umbrella in various colors shapes sizes different lighting conditions… and then someone comes out of the woods carrying a huge rhubarb leaf over their head the computer goes “err…” or another case when is this a stool and when is it a very small coffee table if you turn it upside down at what point does it stop being a stooltable and start begin being a rubber boot drying rack httpwwwstoolsonlinecoukshopimagesthumbstrubberwoodstool2402244ffjpg people don’t need to decide because we don’t fundamentally operate on rigid categories of what things are report comment sadhana says february 13 2017 at 745 pm machines do not learn they process information and relay it to an observer independent of an observer they are purely making calculations while yes human minds process information in ways not so far apart from the calculators calculators are a construct of human innovation humans can learn independent of the observations of others in current scenarios humans are the ones learning the silicon wafers are as dumb as ever maybe a few electrons heavier ai doesn’t need to resemble the human thought process with all of its imperfections either in some cases selflessness is beneficial nature gave our bodies an arsenal of tools for survival that computers simply do not need intelligence could be silly in it’s own respect as a pursuit for a machine to improve perhaps no thought is necessary report comment reply jacques1956 says february 13 2017 at 1039 am “recursive selfimprovement is pretty much impossible to develop on a machine” have you ever heard of genetic algorithm httpsenwikipediaorgwikigeneticalgorithm report comment reply dax says february 13 2017 at 1148 am those work when you already know what “better” is selfimprovement in the sense of general ai doesn’t afford you that information or at the very least you have to impose a “better” on the machine to strive towards which would mean it wouldn’t do what you didn’t ask of it – it would do exactly as programmed and no more because you set the end goal and the criteria it wouldn’t be self improvement because it’s not the ai that sets the goals report comment reply artenz says february 13 2017 at 1153 am most people don’t set their own goals either if an ai can do just as well as those people i’ll consider it a great success report comment reply dax says february 13 2017 at 1249 pm most people choose not to choose that’s still a choice at any moment you could say strip off your clothes and jump out the window – plummet do your death that’s within the realm of possibility for a human being not so for the “ai” report comment artenz says february 13 2017 at 149 pm “at any moment you could say strip off your clothes and jump out the window” no i couldn’t i have no desire to do that and i have no idea how to change that desire report comment dax says february 13 2017 at 415 pm ”no i couldn’t i have no desire to do that and i have no idea how to change that desire” that’s missing the point the program doesn’t deviate from its programming – it’s not possible that it would ever come up with the idea of solving a problem by “i’ll jump out the window” because it’s a complete nonsequitur from its software – it can’t make the leap of imagination unless the hardware is seriously broken or you deliberately add a random number generator that has a chance to make the machine suicidal meanwhile it’s perfectly ordinary for people to be crazy to do the crazy perhaps because sometimes it turns out to make sense the guy who invented beam bots put the idea something like this “brains are trying to make order out of chaos while ai researchers are trying to make chaos out of order” – chaos being the random nature of nature rather than the mathematical definition of it it’s perfectly obvious that it only really works one way report comment artenz says february 13 2017 at 1042 pm “the program doesn’t deviate from its programming – it’s not possible that it would ever come up with the idea of solving a problem by “i’ll jump out the window” because it’s a complete nonsequitur from its software ” you’re missing the point i’m also programmed to not jump from windows and i’m not deviating from that programming either report comment jacques1956 says february 13 2017 at 119 pm the way you defend humain brain sound like there is something magic in it on the contrary i think there is nothing magic in the working of our brain it’s feat is only a consequence of the quantitive complexity when we will have the hardware to build neural nets with billions of nodes and trillions of interconnexions between them we will get the same complexity as our brain report comment reply haltux says february 13 2017 at 230 pm an ant has 250000 neurons 400000 times less than a human and still we can’t do that with computers i am still waiting for some convincing video showing robots doing something remotely comparable to an army of ants building an anthive autonomously

at 156 pm want to buy… report comment reply dv82xl says february 13 2017 at 736 am the fact is we cannot come to a consensus regarding consciousness either our own or that of artificial intelligences we simply do not have the data required to define it until such time as we do ethical issues are at best moot the other problem i almost never see discussed is that a truly cognitive ai may not be that useful to those that made it if indeed it suffers from the same limitations as human cognition – the power of machines is that they are strong in the places where we are weak maybe instead of looking to promote a machine to selfawareness via ai artificial intelligence we should be looking to ia intelligence amplification for ourselves report comment reply dassheep says february 13 2017 at 833 am whenever i hear a term that is “impossible to define” but “intuitively obvious” i suspect it’s just an illusion used to explain away some of our questionable behaviors i wouldn’t be surprised at all if it turned out that we simply call “conscious” anything that activates our empathy circuits and the term is otherwise devoid of meaning report comment reply dv82xl says february 13 2017 at 914 am i don’t contend that consciousness is impossible to define in fact i don’t even think it is all that intuitively obvious given issues with determining if it is there in other animals what i am asserting is that we have very little hard data to formulate a meaningful definition of the concept such that it can be applied to decide if a machine is manifesting it report comment reply jacques1956 says february 13 2017 at 1044 am i agree with dassheep it is our emphaty or lack of it that will determine our behaviour toward ai like it is with our pets so the question of consciouness is secondary report comment reply dv82xl says february 13 2017 at 1108 am the question of consciousness is not secondary in fact it will likely be the single most important question as we determine how these things will fit into our society no one disputes a human’s right to exert ownership over the code and hardware of a chatbot i’m not so sure we could allow the same for a hard ai and that argument will not turn on empathy but will depend on establishing the technical bounds of selfawareness report comment artenz says february 13 2017 at 1117 am there’s no way you will be able to define consciousness in a meaningful way nor is it the case that consciousness automatically grants certain rights rights are something you have to earn either by being cute and fuzzy or by force report comment dassheep says february 14 2017 at 1244 am why would the question of ownership and rights have to be tied to consciousness because it’s the last thing that we are unable to fake but there are many things in our culture that you can’t own even though they are not conscious for example you can’t own a hurricane — even if you produce one artificially somehow weather seems to have stayed immune to capitalism somehow and the idea of owning a cloud is still as alien as the idea of owning land used to be before the agricultural revolution report comment dassheep says february 14 2017 at 1236 am yet we insist that it exists even though we don’t even know what it is that doesn’t happen with most terms in our language even if they are as abstract as “truth” or “justice” with consciousness however we are absolutely sure that it exists and that in particular we have it yet we are unable to even tell what it is and how to recognize it this smells like a hardwired hack inside our brains that forces a belief report comment reply dv82xl says february 14 2017 at 337 am or it could be a consequence of the essential selfreferential subjective nature of the experience of consciousness either way it is not possible to assert its existence in any other context without better definitions which in turn need to be based on better data report comment miroslav says february 13 2017 at 824 am our brain is too complex for us to understand whoever studied the control theory knows that even systems with only 2 feedback loops are difficult to understand and here we are trying to emulate a system with probably millions of feedback loops only way to make any progress at all is to start from the lowest levels from animals with only few neurons and construct from there some serious scientists are doing just that everything else is just a pipe dream or getquickfundingonthelatestbuzzword scheme currently we cannot even emulate a functional fruitfly brain with our level of misunderstanding report comment reply artenz says february 13 2017 at 904 am our brains have evolved from smaller ape brains in a million generations without anybody understanding how millions of feedback loops are put together if we understand a bunch of key details we could evolve an artificial brain in a similar way without actually understanding how the whole thing works report comment reply jacques1956 says february 13 2017 at 1050 am considering the success of deep learning one can’t consider it only as a “buzzword” the fruits of deeplearning research are already available since google is using a deeplearning engine to translate between frenchenglish i notice a big improvement report comment reply dassheep says february 13 2017 at 829 am there is a better way you can get involved you can try and support the efforts to avoid malevolent ai like the stuff that eliezer yudkowsky does report comment reply electrobob says february 13 2017 at 846 am somewhat relevant video httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdlrlypiaaoa report comment reply dan julio says february 13 2017 at 857 am i always thought that asimov’s idea described in the final story “the evitable conflict” in “i robot” was an interesting take on ai the robots computers ended up essentially running things because that was the logical outgrowth of their programming to do no harm to humans but they did it in a way that didn’t harm human egos the humans didn’t know they were ruled by the machines and the machines made sure that overall humans had a pretty good existence report comment reply altmarcxs says february 13 2017 at 943 am as long we’re not understanding of the why of religions ethics in ai will be difficult to define that why i’m calling myself a paratheist opposed to the book theist i’m asking how is god defined with the purpose to teach a future ai not turning malevolent seeing the actual religious madness being an atheist is not enough and could it be that neural or any network is god from the ants to the simulated nn worm up to human interactions which leaded to society and finally ethics this schema could be understood as such hope and believing are future based construct that keep us humans alive and don’t turn us malevolent too and perhaps ai will need something utopic a never provable thing like gods just to keep it running watch the progress made in the last year it’s amazing and it’s progression speed gets exponential like when ai gets creative youtube httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvoitgrdhfnwww560h3155d report comment reply nater says february 13 2017 at 1011 am “works of fiction are always a good indicator of the thoughts and feelings the general population has” what no they aren’t these works are generally what a few humans think will entertain other humans in a profitable way report comment reply jawnhenry says february 13 2017 at 1100 am if you don’t believe in artificial intelligence simply observe how many and with what passion all of the artificial intelligentia weigh in on the subject when presented with the most miniscule of opportunities and reason “asking if computers can think is the same as asking if submarines can swim”–edsger djikstra “i have found that the reason a lot of people are interested in artificial intelligence is the same reason a lot of people are interested in artificial limbs they are missing one”–david l parnas artificial intelligence lack of upper case absolutely intended it should be used under no circumstances has fallen into the same disrepute as has weird water fuzzy logic cold fusion ear candling homeopathy perpetualmotion machines noenergy plasma rockets and all other pseudosciences and paraphysics which one can think of–and a lot which can’t even be imagined before you pseudoscientists and technobabbleists get out your flamethrowers pick the ten topranked schools in the world which teach computer science and which are held in the highest esteem by the worldwide scientific and engineering community now write to them asking them to tell you in very explicit terms the high regard and importance in which they hold artificial intelligence research please include these responses in your replies we’ll all be waiting report comment reply nombondeye says february 13 2017 at 1231 pm what they all would probably direct you to their labs which are led by reputable scientists amply funded and produce scholarly work to support continued funding and technological development it looks like many also have coursework for training future engineers to work on these softwaresystems too report comment reply jerry says february 13 2017 at 1131 am ai more than brunette hair dye report comment reply dax says february 13 2017 at 1201 pm ”the idea is that an ai would be capable of either improving itself or producing more advanced ais because this would happen quickly a dramatic advancements could happen essentially overnight” all the different ideas of a technological singularity omit to say where the energy and material resources to perform them would come from and it’s assuming there are no hard problems that can’t be solved by throwing more hardware at the issue and the ai can just conjure up knowledge out of nothing without taking time to physically explore its environment ex nihilo nihil fit report comment reply marke3 says february 13 2017 at 1226 pm so the aim is to create something in our own image but does what we want… but thinks for itself… but fits in… but has free will… we tried with pets we tried with kids we tried with people at work and we can’t get it right machines for sure… report comment reply whatnot says february 13 2017 at 150 pm to get a sentient ai going you need to put in two things a set of drives and a set of limitations i’m waiting for someone to figure that out report comment reply miroslav says february 13 2017 at 407 pm well said sir well said the only problem is time few million years perhaps report comment reply dan says february 13 2017 at 220 pm you can’t stop malevolent ai if it interacts with the real world it is either true ai and it thinks for itself or it isn’t we can’t even reliably make benign natural intelligence ie humane humans if we think for ourselves we can do great good or harm and if we don’t think for ourselves we almost always allow others to do great harm furthermore if an ai is self improving it would be subject to some form of unnatural selection and that is essentially a random process that is only directed by the fact that some variations enhance competence therefore it is just as likely to evolve into something that benefits itself at the expense of humanity the concept of an enlightened mind natural or artificial is entirely subjective and context dependant therefore there is no vector that an ai’s evolution would follow that ensures that we benefit the entire idea of “goodness” is an illusion at best we can form a consensus as to what behaviours we condone but even that falls apart when we subject the abstract principles to realworld scenarios assuming you can get everyone to agree on anything and when was the last time the un behaved in a remotely coherent manner human culture is only a singular thing if you say it is all of the conflicting ideas of our species in reality humans live in a cluster of overlapping realities as far as their mind’s are configured “but but science” you cry ah yes and how many people even fully understand and subscribe to that idea ethics is like history ultimately the views of the victor and not some ideal truth that is beyond and above human frailty the only safe strong ai is one that lives in a sandbox world and has no way of directly interacting with the real world it has to live in it’s own little universe and we have to play “god” over it report comment reply the snob says february 13 2017 at 340 pm well a lot of physicists believe we are living inside a simulation… report comment reply dan says february 13 2017 at 528 pm yup i was going to mention that but it is a secondary issue though very profound if it is true it is probably just as well report comment reply jawnhenry says february 13 2017 at 541 pm since you are responsible for broaching the subject you are also responsible for following through on your claim that “…a lot of physicists believe we are living inside a simulation…” a list of at least ten worldclass physicists will do nicely as a start one would think with one additional caveat any list which includes the name of elon musk or any other selfpromoting wannabe

developing agi it could be very low which might explain fermi’s paradox report comment reply artenz says february 15 2017 at 133 am fermi’s paradox is already explained by the great distances between solar systems preventing both travel and straightforward communication for example our tv transmissions are already very challenging to pick up from orbit of pluto let alone from 100 light years away and nearly all of the billions and billions of stars are much further away report comment reply omgwtfzpmbbq says february 15 2017 at 1225 am heh quite possible on the other hand maybe agi is easy but interstellar travel is not i had some crazy idea that perhaps ftl messes up both organic and inorganic systems such that a starship would have to go “full steampunk” and use mechanical clockwork timers to drop inout of hyperspace could explain the lack of any signal an agi is going to figure this out early on and remain confined to its home system sending out the occasional “ping” on a radioquiet band determined by its own mechanisms perhaps 11024 ghz or in the optical band least affected by interstellar dust would be a good place to start report comment reply marc zarzuelazen says

depends on what it happens to learn ie its improvement is dependent on what information you give it even if by chance you can’t program a program to systematically selfimprove because if you knew how exactly improvement happens you could skip all that bother and just program it better in the first place if you already know how to arrive at the solution you don’t need the ai to do it the selflearning ai is a bit of a semantics trick that many people in the ai research community like to pull when they describe what they’re doing for example when they teach asimo to tell the difference of a toy car by verbally repeating “toy car” when the robot is imaging the car the robot learns the cue then the researchers imply that the robot understands that it’s a toy car but all they’ve really done is give it an arbitrary label for arbitrary data and programmed it to repeat the label on cue they might as well have typed the information in to the database manually the robot hasn’t learned anything – they’ve just managed to build a new type of programming “user interface” and a routine to enter data which happens to mimic some of the outward behaviour of people when they discover new objects report comment reply artenz says february 13 2017 at 1148 am alphago improved itself and none of the programmers could have implemented the result directly report comment reply dax says february 13 2017 at 1223 pm of course because none of the programmers have a personal capacity to analyze millions and millions of prerecorded games and then play against themselves to test all the strategies unveiled when you run the algorithms and ferry the data between the steps from analysis to implementation “manually” it’s not called intelligent when you automate the steps to a script so the researchers can go “look no hands” it gets called ai that’s the point report comment dax says february 13 2017 at 1230 pm or to use the other point what if the training set for the program consisted of amateurs who didn’t know how to play would the program still improve to beat the master the idea of systematic selfimprovement is implying that the program can start from some arbitrary data and then improve upon improvement upon improvement until it becomes the best in everything the reduction ad absurdum of the idea is to give the program the letter “a” and expect it to eventually come up with “now fair hippolyta our nuptial hour draws on apace four happy days bring in another moon but o methinks how slow…” report comment haltux says february 13 2017 at 217 pm alphago is

take one small component in isolation siri may use a neural network to recognize a specific word from a stream of a recording of human speech but after that it is just a simple preprogrammed search

program doesn’t deviate from its programming – it’s not possible that it would ever come up with the idea of solving a problem by “i’ll jump out the window” because it’s a complete nonsequitur from its software – it can’t make the leap of imagination unless the hardware is seriously broken or you deliberately add a random number generator that has a chance to make the machine suicidal meanwhile it’s perfectly ordinary for people to be crazy to do the crazy perhaps because sometimes it turns out to make sense the guy who invented beam bots put the idea something like this “brains are trying to make order out of chaos while ai researchers are trying to make chaos out of order” – chaos being the random nature of nature rather than the mathematical definition of it it’s perfectly obvious that it only really works one way report comment artenz says february 13 2017 at 1042 pm “the program doesn’t deviate from its programming – it’s not possible that it would ever come up with the idea of solving a problem by “i’ll jump out the window” because it’s a complete nonsequitur from its software ” you’re missing the point i’m also programmed to not jump from windows and i’m not deviating from that programming either report comment jacques1956 says february 13 2017 at 119 pm the way you defend humain brain sound like there is something magic in it on the contrary i think there is nothing magic in the working of our brain it’s feat is only a consequence of the quantitive complexity when we will have the hardware to build neural nets with billions of nodes and trillions of interconnexions between them we will get the same complexity as our brain report comment reply haltux says february 13 2017 at 230 pm an ant has 250000 neurons 400000 times less than a human and still we can’t do that with computers i am still waiting for some convincing video showing robots doing something remotely comparable to an army of ants building an anthive autonomously report commentdax says february 13 2017 at 1249 pm most people choose not to choose that’s still a choice at any moment you could say strip off your clothes and jump out the window – plummet do your death that’s within the realm of possibility for a human being not so for the “ai” report comment artenz says february 13 2017 at 149 pm “at any moment you could say strip off your clothes and jump out the window” no i

commentdan says february 13 2017 at 156 pm want to buy… report comment replydassheep says february 13 2017 at 833 am whenever i hear a term that is “impossible to define” but “intuitively obvious” i suspect it’s just an illusion used to explain away some of our questionable behaviors i wouldn’t be surprised at all if it turned out that we simply call “conscious” anything that activates our empathy circuits and the term is otherwise devoid of meaning report comment reply dv82xl says february 13 2017 at 914 am i don’t contend that consciousness is impossible to define in fact i don’t even think it is all that intuitively obvious given issues with determining if it is there in other animals what i am asserting is that we have very little hard data to formulate a meaningful definition of the concept such that it can be applied to decide if a machine is manifesting it report comment reply jacques1956 says february 13 2017 at 1044 am i agree with dassheep it is our emphaty or lack of it that will determine our behaviour toward ai like it is with our pets so the question of consciouness is secondary report comment reply dv82xl says february 13 2017 at 1108 am the question of consciousness is not secondary in fact it will likely be the single most important question as we determine how these things will fit into our society no one disputes a human’s right to exert ownership over the code and hardware of a chatbot i’m not so sure we could allow the same for a hard ai and that argument will not turn on empathy but will depend on establishing the technical bounds of selfawareness report comment artenz says february 13 2017 at 1117 am there’s no way you will be able to define consciousness in a meaningful way nor is it the case that consciousness automatically grants certain rights rights are something you have to earn either by being cute and fuzzy or by force report comment dassheep says february 14 2017 at 1244 am why would the question of ownership and rights have to be tied to consciousness because it’s the last thing that we are unable to fake but there are many things in our culture that you can’t own even though they are not conscious for example you can’t own a hurricane — even if you produce one artificially somehow weather seems to have stayed immune to capitalism somehow and the idea of owning a cloud is still as alien as the idea of owning land used to be before the agricultural revolution report comment dassheep says february 14 2017 at 1236 am yet we insist that it exists even though we don’t even know what it is that doesn’t happen with most terms in our language even if they are as abstract as “truth” or “justice” with consciousness however we are absolutely sure that it exists and that in particular we have it yet we are unable to even tell what it is and how to recognize it this smells like a hardwired hack inside our brains that forces a belief report comment reply dv82xl says february 14 2017 at 337 am or it could be a consequence of the essential selfreferential subjective nature of the experience of consciousness either way it is not possible to assert its existence in any other context without better definitions which in turn need to be based on better data report commentdv82xl says february 13 2017 at 914 am i don’t contend that consciousness is impossible to define in fact i don’t even

generations without anybody understanding how millions of feedback loops are put together if we understand a bunch of key details we could evolve an artificial brain in a similar way without actually understanding how the whole thing works report comment reply jacques1956 says february 13 2017 at 1050 am considering the success of deep learning one can’t consider it only as a “buzzword” the fruits of deeplearning research are already available since google is using a deeplearning engine to translate between frenchenglish i notice a big improvement report comment replynombondeye says february 13

flexible enterprises it managers and technical leads rely on it pro for stateoftheart solutionsartificial intelligence ai is increasingly hyped by vendors of all shapes and sizesfrom wellfunded startups to the wellknown software brands financial organizations are building aidriven investment advisors1 chat bots provide everything from customer service2 to sales assistance3 although ai is receiving a lot of visibility the fact that these technologies all require some element of knowledge engineering information architecture and highquality data sources is not well known many vendors sidestep this question or claim that their algorithms operate on unstructured information sources understand those sources interpret the user query and present the result without predefined architectures or human intervention that very well might be true in certain circumstances but most applications require a significant amount of hard work on the part of humans before neural nets

heredigitalgenius a product that received press coverage at a conference in 20154 uses deep learning and neural nets digitalgenius first classifies the incoming questions into one of several categories for further processing product information account information action request comparison question recommendation question and so on these classifications qualify as a foundational element of information architecture the starting point is contextualizing the query which is then passed to other modules including product information systems and other databases and apis each of these systems and sources in turn needs to be well architected to return the correct information if the information is not structured and curated in some way there is nothing for the system to return the ability of digitalgenius to use ai to engage customers is predicated on having highquality structured dataorganizations are in a neverending cycle of improving their digital means of engaging with customers these initiatives include improving personalization of the user experience by presenting more relevant content tuning search results to return exactly what the user is interested in and improving the effectiveness of offers and promotions organizations might also strive to increase response rates to email communications provide better customer selfservice increase participation in user communities and other social media venues and generally enhance the product experience through various other online mechanisms in each of these cases the means of engagement is providing a relevant piece of data or content in the form of promotions offers sales nextbest action products for cross sell and upsell answers to questions and so on at exactly the right time and in the context that is most meaningful and valuable to the userthis is done by interpreting the various signals that users provide through their current and past interactions with the organization these signals include prior purchases realtime clickstream data support center interactions consumed content preferences buying characteristics demographics firmographics social media information and any other electronic body language that is captured by marketing automation and integration technologies a search query could return a different result for a technical user than a nontechnical user for example at its core search is a recommendation engine the signal is the search phrase and the recommendation is the result set the more that is known about the user the more the recommendation can be tailored if the recommendation is related to a product then clean wellstructured product data is a preconditiongetting these recommendations right and truly personalizing the user experience requires that product data be correctly structured and organized that content processes be integrated into product onboarding and that associations can be made among products content and user intent signals the relationship of products to content is based on knowledge of the users task and what content would help him or her accomplish it the task might be a review a howto product specifications reference materials instructions diagrams and images or other content that helps the user decide on the purchaseai encompasses a class of application that allows for easier interaction with computers and also allows computers to take on more of the types of problems that were typically in the realm of human cognition every ai program interfaces with information and the better that information is structured the more effective the program is a corpus of information contains the answers that the program is attempting to process and interpret structuring that information for retrieval is referred to as knowledge engineering and the structures are called knowledge representationknowledge representation consists of taxonomies controlled vocabularies thesaurus structures and all of the relationships between terms and concepts these elements collectively make up the ontology an ontology represents a domain of knowledge and the information architecture structures and mechanisms for accessing and retrieving answers in specific contexts ontologies can also capture common sense knowledge of objects processes materials actions events and myriad more classes of realworld logical relationships in this way an ontology forms a foundation for computer reasoning even if the answer to a question is not explicitly contained in the corpus the answer can be inferred from the facts terms and relationships in the ontology in a practical sense this can make the system more user friendly and forgiving when the user makes requests using phrase variations and more capable when it encounters use cases that were not completely defined when it was developed in effect the system can reason and make logical deductionscorrectly interpreting user signals enables the system to present the right content for the users context and requires not only that our customer data is clean properly structured and integrated across multiple systems and processes but also that the system understand the relationship between the user his or her specific task the product and the content neededall assembled dynamically in real time building these structures and relationships and harmonizing the architecture across the various backend platforms and frontend systems results in an enterprise ontology that enables a personalized omnichannel experience some might call this an enterprise information architecture however there is more to it than the data structures recall that the definition of an ontology includes realworld logic and relationships the ontology can contain knowledge about processes customer needs and content relationships5consumer and industrial products need to be associated with content and user context but content can also be mined to suggest products for a user context for an industrial application a user might need parts and tools to complete maintenance on a hydraulic system using adaptive patternrecognition software to mine reference manuals about hydraulic systems and repair the system can extract a list of needed tools and related parts a search on hydraulic repair will present a dynamically generated product page based on the product relationships and correlated with the companys offerings to some information professionals this might sound complex and cumbersome to implement however there are emerging approaches that bring these aspirations closer to realitythe concept of what constitutes ai has evolved as technology has evolved a colleague of mine has said its artificial intelligence until you know how it works an interesting perspective indeed i found support for this in material from an mit ai courseseemingly intractable problems have been solved by advances in processing power and capabilities not long ago autonomous vehicles were considered technologically infeasible due to the volume of data that needed to be processed in real time speech recognition was unreliable and required extensive speakerdependent training sessions mobile phones were once automobile phones requiring a car trunk full of equipment my first car phone in the 80s in addition to costing several thousand dollars left little room for anything else in the spacious trunk most ai is quietly taken for granted today the word processor i am using was once considered an advanced ai applicationunder the covers ai is complex however this complexity is hidden from the user and is in fact the enabler of an easy intuitive experience it is not magic and it requires foundational structures that can be reused across many different processes departments and applications these structures are generally first developed in silos and standalone tools however the true power will be realized when considered in a holistic framework of machineintelligenceenabled infrastructure ai will change the business landscape but will require investments in product and content architecture customer data and analytics and the harmonization of tools in the customer engagement ecosystem the organizations that adopt these approaches will gain significant advantages over the competitionai approaches are proposed as the answer to enterprise challenges around improving customer engagement by dealing with information overload before those approaches can be leveraged however organizations need to possess the data needed as inputs to machine learning algorithms that can in turn process these diverse signals from unstructured and structured sources clean wellstructured managed data is assumedin many cases the data being processed or corpus being analyzed by ai systems is typically less structured than betterorganized sources such as financial and transactional data learning algorithms can be used to both extract meaning from ambiguous queries and attempt to make sense of unstructured data inputs humans might phrase questions using different terminology or they might ask overly broad questions they are not always clear about their objectivesthey dont necessarily know what they are looking for this is why human sales people typically engage prospects in conversations about their overall needs rather than asking them what they are looking for at least the good ones doinserting ai into the process is more effective when users know what they want and can clearly articulate it and where there is a relatively straightforward answer the algorithm does what it does best in terms of handling variations in how those questions are asked interpreting the meaning of the question and processing other unstructured signals that help further contextualize the users intent there are many flavors of ai and many classes of algorithm that comprise ai systems however even when ai systems are used to find structure from completely unstructured information they still require structure at the data layergiven that the data being searched by the ai system is unstructured why do we need information architecture unstructured information is typically in the form of text from pages documents comments surveys social media or some other source though it is unstructured there are still parameters associated with the source and context social media information requires various parameters to describe users their posts relationships time and location of posts links hashtags and so on the information architecture question in this case characterizes the structures of the input data so that the system can be programmed to find patterns of interest even in the case of unsupervised machine learning a class of application that derives signals from data that are not predefined by a human the programmer still needs to describe the data in the first place with attributes and values there might not be predefined categories for outliers and patterns that are identified but the input needs to have structurea common fallacy in considering big data sources that form inputs for machine learning is that because the data is schemaless does not have a predefined structure no structure is required data still requires attribute definitions normalization and cleansing to apply machine learning and patternidentification algorithms6 as enterprises embark on the path to machine learning and ai they should first and foremost be developing an enterprise ontology that represents all of the knowledge that any ai system they deploy would process analyze leverage or requiresome vendors might debate the value of this approach insisting that their algorithms can handle whatever you throw at themhowever i would argue that this is only the case when the ontologies are selfcontained in the tool even so there will always be gaps between what a tool developed for broad adoption can contain and the specialized needs of an enterprise even if the tool is developed for a specific industry the differences in processes found from organization to organization require specialized vocabularies and contextual knowledge relationships this is a significant undertaking however not doing so misses an essential step in the processmuch of what is described as ai is an extension of wellknown approaches to addressing information management problems all of which require clean foundational data and information structures as a starting point the difference between standard information management and practical ai lies in understanding the limits of these technologies and where they can best be applied to address enterprise challengesthe remainder of this article describes how your organization can identify use cases that will benefit from ai identifies data sources that offer reliable and meaningful insights to train and guide ai and defines governance curation and scalable processes that will allow for continuous improvement of ai and cognitive computing systemsdifferentiating ai use cases from standard information management use cases requires considering the sources of data that comprise the signals being processed the type of task the user faces and the systems that will be part of the solution the difference in approaches to these problems lies in how the sources of data will be curated and ingested how organizing principles need to be derived and applied the sophistication of the functionality desired and the limitations of the current solution in place an ai approach will require a greater level of investment sponsorship at the executive level programlevel governance and an enterprise span of influence it will also require a longerterm commitment than a typical information management project although there are opportunities to deploy limited scope ai fully leveraging it as a transformative class of technology should be part of an overall digital transformation strategy in some cases on the scale of enterprise resource planning erp programs with commensurate support funding and commitment some erp programs can cost us50 to 100 million or more although no organization will approach an unproven set of technologies with that level of commitment funding needs to be allocated to extend proven approaches with emerging ai technologiesthe roadmap for ai transformation includes continuous evaluation of payback and roi and focuses on shortterm wins while pursuing longerterm goals most organizations are attempting to solve the problems described in table 1 with limited approaches departmentallevel solutions standalone tools and insufficient funding these problem classes are facing most enterprises and though progress can be made with limited resources and siloed approaches this would be an extension of business as usual truly transformative applications will require an enterprise view of the organizations knowledge landscape and implementation of new governance metrics and data quality programsgovernance to make decisions metrics to monitor the effectiveness of those decisions and data quality to fuel

and recognizing that one class of tool is frequently leveraged in other tools and applications an intelligent agent can use inference engines which in turn can leverage learning algorithms for example the table articulates considerations for exploring one approach versus anotherclick on the image to enlarge itai and cognitive computing are managed in the same way as many other information and technology governance programs they require executive sponsorship charters roles and responsibilities decisionmaking protocols escalation processes defined agendas and linkage to specific business objectives and processes these initiatives are a subset of digital transformation and are linked to customer life cycles and internal value chains because the objective is always to affect a process outcome all ai and cognitive computing programs are closely aligned with ongoing metrics at multiple levels of detailfrom content and data quality to process effectiveness and satisfaction of business imperativesand ultimately are linked to the organizational competitive and market strategy milestones and stages are defined to release funding for program phases each with defined success criteria and measurable outcomesai will no doubt continue to impact every aspect of our personal and professional lives much of this impact will occur in subtle wayssuch as improved usability of applications and findability of information these will not necessarily appear on the surface to be ai over time aidriven intelligent virtual assistants will become more fluent and capable and will become the preferred mechanism for interacting with technology humans create knowledge while machines process store and act on that knowledge ai is applied human knowledge organizations need to develop the foundations for advancing ai by capturing and curating that knowledge and by building the foundational data structures that form the scaffolding for that knowledge without those components the

yesterday’s blog traffic check in on the monthly lead count build a list for your next email send report on the results of your latest content campaignsome days it’s easy to feel like you don’t actually spend that much time marketing instead of crafting engaging content or building relationships with new prospects you’re stuck staring at a screen of numbers asking yourself what they mean questioning if you’re interpreting them right and then figuring out how this data should inform your future projects you want to know that your work is making a real difference on the bottom line but to be honest you’re buried in data up to your eyeballsthat’s the irony with datadriven marketing we have spreadsheets upon spreadsheets and dashboards upon dashboards but do we really know what to do with it all on any given day you make a lot of small decisions that can have a significant impact on results what time should i send my email newsletter what topic should i write my next blog post on should it be a blog post or should it actually be a video and for that cta in the conclusion what color will actually make people clickvery soon all of these questions will be answered by robotswell not robots exactly but artificial intelligencewhether you consider yourself techinclined or not you’ve likely heard of ai perhaps you recall scenes of rosie cooking dinner for the jetsons or hal 9000 commandeering dave’s spacecraft control room or maybe you’ve noticed the onslaught of headlines describing ai as either the future or a cause for concernso it’s worth asking what will ai mean to you what will the coming revolution mean for your daytoday work your business and ultimately your customerswe should probably get one thing out of the way artificial intelligence doesn’t mean robots and at least at the moment it’s not flying cars or revengeseeking cyborgs eitherin fact artificial intelligence is not even easy to define in the most general of terms ai refers to an area of computer science that makes machines do things that would require intelligence if done by a human this includes tasks like learning seeing talking socializing reasoning or problem solvingwe wouldnt be the first to admit that this definition is a little vague for years technologists have argued over what counts as ai and what falls short so when youre trying to wrap your mind around what exactly ai can accomplish it can be easier to think about one of the many subfields that fall under the ai umbrellamachine learning for example is a subfield that allows machines to find hidden insights within data sets without being explicitly told where to look if it sounds complicated you’re not alone but as hubspot senior software engineer asher krim explains machine learning is just an application of statistics“the way i think about machine learning is that it’s basically a function” krim said “you put something in and you get something out with machine learning what you put in is your data and what you get out is some sort of revelation”even if you’re not familiar with the complexities behind machine learning you’ve most likely benefited from the results when spotify suggests music you might like or when facebook automatically tags a friend in a photo that’s the result of machine learning these applications learn your preferences or can recognize a face based on past interactions with the platform which helps the program predict and serve better results over time these machines learn like a human would through experience and trainingfor example let’s say you want to teach a computer to distinguish between a cat and a dog you might say cats have four legs a tail and pointed ears dogs have four legs a tail and floppy ears but if you show that machine a chihuahua or a corgi will it say it’s a catbetween tail length fur texture and color there’s a lot of labels a developer would have to program manually to help a traditional computer spot the difference but with machine learning you feed the computer thousands of photos of cats and dogs so it can learn to spot the difference by experience or in the world of machine learning lots of datayou could then break down machine learning ever further depending on the amount of human involvement in the process the data might have labels to help the machine categorize the information through what’s called supervised learning or in many cases where labeled data is too hard or too expensive to come by a machine could use unsupervised learning to discover patterns in a dataset on its ownwhat is machine learning and how exactly does it work find out what marketers need to know httpstcofum83grjqn ai pictwittercompxh4hz0wyuanother wellknown area of ai is natural language processing where a machine is able to transpose your voice into text conduct the query and read the answer back in human syntax in other words you don’t have to speak in code to your smartphone cortana microsoft’s voice assistant actually picks up on slang and emotion the more she’s usedvoice search which is available on the 39 billion apple android and windows mobile devices worldwide has driven the increasing adoption of ai in fact 74 of our survey respondents used it at least once within the past month half use it daily and are happy with the quality of the resultspeople just dont realize it check out hubspots research report for more stats on the adoption of ai voice search and botsas with nearly every technology trend that has risen before it’s worth asking if ai is simply a fad palmpilots anyone or if it’s here to stay before you shrug it off know that ai isn’t new in fact for more than 60 years the field of ai has been steadily growing outside of the public spotlightthe term “artificial intelligence” was coined back in 1956 when dartmouth professor john mccarthy led a small team during a summer project to see if machines could learn like a young child does using trial and error to develop formal reasoning according to the original project proposal they sought to make machines “use language form abstractions and concepts solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans and improve themselves”since then the technology has remained for the most part within university classrooms suffering what some call a few “ai winters” that is until nowat its core three main ingredients are fueling ai’s rise to mainstream attention todayput all that together and you’ve got a lot of technologists ceos and venture capitalists diving into the possibilities of a new ai era ari sheinkin vp of marketing analytics at ibm admitted that applications of ai are just now intersecting with the lives of average people in ways they could never have before“the ability to get that amount of data and have the power and the processing and the tools that actually can make sense of it 10 years ago it would have been a research project” sheinkin saidis ai just a fad or the future there’s never been a better time for marketers to start learning httpstcofum83grjqn pictwittercom9iprkkxqjbwhile its long history is important there’s no better proof that ai is here to stay than the value it’s already providingfor instance if you were to visit the hilton in mclean virginia you could be greeted by a friendly 2foottall robot named connie with the help of ibm’s cognitive computing technology watson hilton created the world’s first aipowered hotel concierge to help personalize guest experiences when you check in you’ll find her perched on the front desk answering questions about the hotel’s amenities or using her moving arms and fingers to literally point guests in the right direction of the perfect restaurantthe same technology behind connie also created the first aiproduced trailer for the thriller morgan ibm researchers fed watson 100plus horror film trailers so that it could identify patterns in the visuals sound and composition it then processed the movie morgan and was able to identify the best scenes to include in the trailer in the most impactful orderimage credit hilton worldwide via usa todayaccording to an exclusive with wired watson finished the entire process in 24 hours a task that would take humans 10 to 30 days to complete“the amount of research thats happening today is just unparalleled” krim said “and it’s bringing results its not just ‘oh heres a cool thing that we can do and maybe one day it will work’ its ‘heres a cool thing were doing now and its in our product at google baidu apple and microsoft’”but you don’t have to work at a fortune 500 company to witness the value of ai consider the adoption in your own home thanks to the rise of the internet of things even the least techy of people can personalize their lives from their pocket from optimizing the temperature of their home to reduce energy costs to ordering more laundry detergent from alexa with their voice to using security cameras with facial recognition software so you know if it’s a human or a stray neighborhood pet at your doorand this is the point of aipowered technologies they’re designed to flow into the platforms and tools we already use and make even the most mundane tasks more efficient and accurate of course there are still those moments when siri misunderstands your request to “call me a cab” and actually changes your name to “acab” but as krim explains the only time people tend to notice ai is when it goes wrong“when machine learning is done well you don’t necessarily know that it’s happening” krim said63 are already using ai tools without even realizing it find out why httpstcofum83grjqn pictwittercomnwho0ei94rwhich points to why 37 of those surveyed on the adoption of artificial intelligence said they hadn’t encountered an ai technology yet when this same group was asked if they used voice search technology 63 responded “yes” people are using ai every day without realizing ityet some barriers remain when it comes to adoption in the working world of those taking advantage of voice technologies for example most use it in places where they don’t feel judged for talking out loud on their phone we found that 84 admit to using natural language processing at home and 44 in the car while only 27 said they would at workonline shopping has come a long way since the beginning days of ebay and pushing visitors to call a 1800 number and it’s about to radically change due to both mobile shopping and the rise of aiconsider this example our friend sam is in the market for a new portable solar stove for his upcoming rv trip across the country he’s hitting the road in a few days so there’s no time to scroll through an online catalog or drive to the nearest outdoor gear store instead he turns to facebookwith the help of an aipowered chatbot sam is able to browse popular product options and purchase his final choice without leaving facebook messenger if he has a question on a product’s dimensions or the different shipping options he can just ask the bot and the moment he has a question the bot can’t answer a customer service agent steps in to take the lead all in the same chat windowsince facebook opened up its messenger platform 30000 chatbots have already been released that allow paymentsin our research report we looked at how the rise of bots is impacting online transactions as it turns out there’s tremendous potential for businesses large and small to use bots to remove friction from the buying process according the survey 47 are interested buying products through bots even surpassing the 37 who said they’d buy on social mediathis level of interest remained when we asked about customer service interactions in fact 40 of shoppers don’t care if they’re helped by an ai tool or a human as long as their question gets answeredwith the help of artificial intelligence bots are blurring the line between marketing sales and customer service to radically change the way people research shop and buy brands like the north face are already using this sort of technology to decrease the time it takes to discover and purchase a product instead of having to review a long list of product options the shopper tells the bot they need a parka to snowboard in vermont and they’re matched with a customized list of suggestionsand as buying from bots becomes more mainstream b2c consumers and eventually b2b buyers will begin to expect these types of interactions from brands there’s no need to stay on hold as you’re passed from department to department just to get information on if the product is covered by a warranty as we saw in the example with the facebook messenger bot even the necessity to visit to a business’ website to make an online purchase is fading away consumers will expect to get information delivered to them rather than having to search for itmarketers take note each of these changing consumer habits should transform the way you think about reaching your customer as chris messina former developer experience lead at uber pointed out in an interview on the growth show marketers will need to consider how to be more “human” and less “formulaic” in their communication approachmessina explained “we have such a crass and cynical approach to marketing and to messaging that we are willing to berate millions and millions of people to get a hundred people to sort of say ‘yes’ or be interested when there might be better ways to actually show value and to integrate yourself into communities in a way that shows that you care”what’s the difference between marketing that’s loved or ignored in the future it could be ai httpstcofum83grjqn pictwittercom7jawmw3ptvwhile we’ve seen big developments in datadriven marketing in the past 10 years ai will produce smarter insights at an even quicker pace empowering marketers to make better decisions and create more impactful communicationsthat means very soon marketers will need ai to achieve the degree of personalization expected by consumers“theres too much information out there” sheinkin said “theres too much of an expectation that things are personalized and relevant to leave it to traditional models”even a simple act such as writing a blog post will change today you might stress over what to write about in the first place while writing you struggle to get the tone right for the subject matter and feel that your argument could be bolstered by data points that you don’t believe existwith artificial intelligence capabilities your topic could be automatically chosen for you based on an uptick in search interest past performance of the topic and your established editorial mix for the week it’ll look not just at your target audience’s search habits but your own content library for linking opportunities as you write it might suggest ways to tweak your language to better connect with your reader for those stories routed in data machine learning could be used to identify trends and write out those insights in natural language between baseball highlights and quarterly earnings reports the associated pres and automated insights is already making this a realitypreparing your next email machine learning will be there again to lend a hand thanks to a marketing software full of clickthrough rates and customer history there will be no need to wonder what’s the best subject for an email what image should you use or what time you should send the blast in fact email blasts themselves will likely be a thing of the pastalready marketers and sales professionals are employing chatbots to provide them with the most uptodate information about their prospects customers and programs an example is growthbot which can be prompted to deliver information on a company’s topviewed blog posts the software used by a competitor or the ppc keywords they are buying the top twitter users in a specific location and morecall yourself a datadriven marketer very soon you’ll need ai to keep up httpstcofum83grjqn pictwittercomqwsnv1zdijyou won’t just need to rethink data infrastructure or the way you build content youll have to rethink marketing as a profession in the next five to ten years datadriven marketing will not look anything like what it does today as krim explains machine learning will be the solution successful marketers use to make informed decisions and build an audience“its taking away a lot of those decisions that marketers might not always know why theyre deciding” krim said “if youre building an email list you have all these options for ways you can determine who is eligible to be in that list but how do you pick that takes a lot of experience and its very easy to get wrong machine learning can come in and help us do that better”predicting the future of work has long been an tempting topic for bloggers business leaders and the like to tackle there’s the rise of the remote worker the habits of the millennial employee or the collaborative benefits of an open office floor plan but when you talk about the way we’ll work five years now you can’t do so without considering the impact of aiwant to learn more about how ai will impact your business view the recording from our live discussionfeaturing bastiaan janmaat of datafox adam long of automated insights and amir salihefendic of doist makers of todoist on how ai will impact our work from productivity to sales to hiring to content creation and more click play belowthe problem is that as people predict the impact of artificial intelligence in the workplace it has become a combat story where humans are pitted against robots in a spirit of fear they describe a world where aipowered technologies take over jobs make skills obsolete and skyrocket unemployment ratesyes ai will change millions of jobs it’s likely that many jobs that require humans to man vehicles will be replaced by selfdriving cars some factory positions could be automated by robots or deemed obsolete by 3d printers even for those who consider their output creative are not entirely safe ai technologies have painted portraits composed symphonies and even produced recipesbut the realities around our aienabled future are not all negative many argue that ai will create new more interesting jobs others predict a massive economic revival potentially increasing labor productivity by up to 40 by 2035 even the white house is considering how ai could revitalize security education infrastructure and public policyto say the least thinking about how ai will alter the modern workforce is an exciting yet unsettling thought and in times of immense change it’s human nature to want to reduce a complicated situation to a good guy and a bad guy but it’s more complex than thatai is not a story of human versus machine instead it’s human and machine versus problemby automating and optimizing the repetitive tasks of your job ai will give you more time to focus on your customers that way you can build meaningful relationships spend more time on strategic initiatives and ultimately be more human“ais definition is about helping professionals be more impactful in their jobs” said sheinkin “it is helping doctors make better diagnoses it is helping film editors make better films its helping musicians make better music its helping marketers make better bids on paid media it is about augmenting human intelligence with capabilities that just arent available through traditional technology”hear dan pink discuss the main motivators for millennials and why robots wont steal your jobdiscover the stats on consumer

our relevant content products and services you may unsubscribe from these communications at any time for more information check out our privacy policywritten by sophia bernazzanithe other day at work my colleague hubspot marketing director ryan bonnici sent around a link on slack to a website called “will robots take my job”we were thrilled to learn marketing managers had only a 14 chance of our jobs being automated or replaced by robots and artificial intelligence and although i breathed a sigh of relief that writing has only a 38 chance of being automated it made me think about job roles that weren’t so luckyif you think job disruption by ai is limited to the assembly lines think again ai is doing a better job than humans at some aspects of sales and marketing tooai can analyze sales calls far faster than any sales manager could in fact it would take 9 years of nonstop sales call analysis for a human being to compete and that’s if they didn’t take vacation or sleep and ai is already being used to develop marketers’ content strategies and email marketing playbooks it’s only a matter of time before it plays a bigger role in the processhubspot cofounder and cto dharmesh shah has a more positive outlook on the future of ai in fact he thinks bots and ai will make us better at our jobs and more secure in our careers not the other way aroundthe truth probably lies halfway between these camps in many cases ai will serve to make our jobs easier and will make us more effective and datadriven but the fact remains that some jobs will be replaced by machines it’s the essence of any industrial or technological revolution the good news is some jobs won’t be strictly replaced they just might be adjusted to account for new technologies’ “careers”based on the landmark 2013 study that inspired “will robots take my job” we’ve rounded up some of the marketing and sales roles most likely to be replaced by robots bots and ai in the next few years this study analyzes the likely probability that a job will be replaced by automation and computerization based primarily on the level of routine a job has and the specialized training and social intelligence required to complete it it’s not an exhaustive list but it gives you an idea of what your life could look like in a few yearslikelihood 99why you probably already receive robocalls on behalf of various products and services and career growth in the telemarketing space is expected to decline by 3 by the year 2024 this is largely in part because of the requirements to be successful unlike other sales roles telemarketers dont require a high level of social or emotional intelligence to be successful think about it are you likely to purchase from a telemarketer conversion rates for direct telephone sales are typically less than 10 making this role a ripe opportunity to be automatedlikelihood 98why jobs in this role are expected to decline 8 by 2024 and its no surprise why most bookkeeping is becoming automated if it hasnt been already quickbooks freshbooks and microsoft office already offer software that does the bookkeeping for you thats much more affordable than a persons salary so its no surprise this job has such a high probabilitylikelihood 96why this one is surprising because the job growth is supposed to increase 7 by 2024 but just because theres demand doesnt make you safe from automation as companies grow in size especially across multinational markets a human and paperbased system can present more hurdles time delays and costs automated benefits systems can save time and effort for providing benefits to large numbers of employees and companies like ultipro and workday are already being widely adoptedlikelihood 96why pam predicted this back on the office but in case youre not a fan automated phone and scheduling systems can replace a lot of the traditional receptionist role especially at modern technology companies that dont have officewide phone systems or multinational corporationslikelihood 94why couriers and delivery people are already being replaced by drones and robots so its only a matter of time until this space is dominated by automation altogether at the same time this space is expected to grow by 5 by 2024 so it might not happen as quickly as you thinklikelihood 84why proofreading software is everywhere and we use it a lot here at hubspot from microsoft words simple spelling and grammar check to grammarly and hemingway app there are a lot of technologies out there that make it easy to selfcheck your own writinglikelihood 65why the field is projected to grow 12 by 2024 but with so much content on the internet with instructions stepbystep guides and hacks out there its no surprise companies will rely more heavily on bots and automation to answer support questions from employees and customers in the futurelikelihood 61why market research analysts play an incredibly important role in the development of messaging content and products but automated ai and surveys can compile this information more and more easily growthbot for example can conduct market research on nearby businesses and competitors with a simple slack commandlikelihood 54why as advertising shifts away from print and tv and towards web and social media landscapes people simply dont need to be managing those sales for marketers who want to buy ad space more social media platforms are making it easy for people to buy space through free application program interfaces apis and selfserve ad marketplaces to remove the salesperson and make it faster and easier for users to make money and thats reflected in the projected 3 decline in the industrylikelihood 92why if youve visited a mall car dealership or furniture store lately you might not have been assisted by a salesperson at all from start to finish companies are democratizing the shopping experience with features like selfcheckout and the modern buyer is much more internetsavvy and more likely to do internet research and make a buying decision on their ownlikelihood 055why not its kind of in the name but your companys human resources department will likely always need a human at the helm to manage interpersonal conflict with the help of noncognitive and reasoning skills the field is projected to grow 9 by 2024 as companies grow and need more robust structures for supporting and helping employeeslikelihood 13why not sales managers need a high level of emotional intelligence to hit their quotas each month network and collaborate with customers and motivate and encourage the larger sales team managers also have to analyze data and interpret trends and the high levels of intelligence required plus the constant need to adapt to new situations makes this role safe from automationlikelihood 14why not marketing managers have to interpret data monitor trends oversee campaigns and create content they also have to nimbly adapt and respond to changes and feedback from the rest of the company and customers making this another humanforward career ai isnt quite ready to replicatelikelihood 15why not successful pr managers rely on a network of relationships and contacts to procure press placements and buzz for the companies they represent making this another completely safe role pr managers who have to raise awareness around an issue or mission need a particularly human touch to raise funds or get people to participate in a campaign too and jobs are expected to grow 7 by 2024likelihood 15why not its nearly impossible to automate leadership after all its hard enough to teach it chief executives have to inform broad strategy represent companies missions and objectives and motivate huge teams of people working for them companies may answer to stakeholders and boards of directors who likely wouldnt want a robot giving them an earnings report eitherlikelihood 37why not event planning is a growing field and if you ask anyone on our events team here at hubspot whether youre planning an event for employees customers or an industry event with tens of thousands of attendees the planning process has many many moving parts involved planners have to coordinate and negotiate with vendors contractors and freelancers to make things come together and the organizational and people skills involved will make this another nearimpossible role to automatelikelihood 38why not i breathed a sigh of relief on this one writers have to ideate create and produce original written material ais can do some of this with title suggestions writing prompts and automated social media messages but blog posts books movies and plays will likely be written by humans for the foreseeable futurelikelihood 42why not software engineering and development is hard enough for human beings to do and the time and skill investment needed to create applications software and websites will be tough to replicate especially since developers need to execute perfectly to create great products for customers the field is expected to grow by 19 by 2024 so if youre a software developer youre sitting pretty for nowlikelihood 55why not while some of the load can be lifted from editors with the automated proofreading technology mentioned previously editors have to review writers submission for clarity accuracy comprehensiveness and originality while there is some software that can spotcheck for clarity and scan for plagiarism the editor role must be carried out by a human in order to read work as another human wouldlikelihood 82why not although there are some ais taking small and somewhat creepy steps in the graphic design space graphic design is both artistic and technical making it an ideal role for a human being to carry out like writing all work needs to be original and created to the clients wishes so graphic design needs to be created with a human artist and editor allinoneto learn more about how you can keep working with ai to improve your work and

defaultdict(<class 'str'>, {'title': 'artificial intelligence in medicine an introduction', 'p': 'from the very earliest moments in the modern history of the computer scientists have dreamed of creating an electronic brain of all the modern technological quests this search to create artificially intelligent ai computer systems has been one of the most ambitious and not surprisingly controversialit also seems that very early on scientists and doctors alike were captivated by the potential such a technology might have in medicine eg ledley and lusted 1959 with intelligent computers able to store and process vast stores of knowledge the hope was that they would become perfect doctors in a box assisting or surpassing clinicians with tasks like diagnosiswith such motivations a small but talented community of computer scientists and healthcare professionals set about shaping a research program for a new discipline called artificial intelligence in medicine aim these researchers had a bold vision of the way aim would revolutionise medicine and push forward the frontiers of technologyai in medicine at that time was a largely usbased research community work originated out of a number of campuses including mittufts pittsburgh stanford and rutgers eg szolovits 1982 clancey and shortliffe 1984 miller 1988 the field attracted many of the best computer scientists and by any measure their output in the first decade of the field remains a remarkable achievementin reviewing this new field in 1984 clancey and shortliffe provided the following definitionmuch has changed since then and today this definition would be considered narrow in scope and vision today the importance of diagnosis as a task requiring computer support in routine clinical situations receives much less emphasis j durinck e coiera r baud et al the role of knowledge based systems in clinical practice in eds barahona and christenen knowledge and decisions in health telematics the next decade ios press amsterdam pp 199 203 1994 so despite the focus of much early research on understanding and supporting the clinical encounter expert systems today are more likely to be found used in clinical laboratories and educational settings for clinical surveillance or in datarich areas like the intensive care setting for its day however the vision captured in this definition of aim was revolutionaryafter the first euphoria surrounding the promise of artificially intelligent diagnostic programmes the last decade has seen increasing disillusion amongst many with the potential for such systems yet while there certainly have been ongoing challenges in developing such systems they actually have proven their reliability and accuracy on repeated occasions shortliffe 1987much of the difficulty has been the poor way in which they have fitted into clinical practice either solving problems that were not perceived to be an issue or imposing changes in the way clinicians worked what is now being realised is that when they fill an appropriately role intelligent programmes do indeed offer significant benefits one of the most important tasks now facing developers of aibased systems is to characterise accurately those aspects of medical practice that are best suited to the introduction of artificial intelligence systemsin the remainder of this chapter the initial focus will thus remain on the different roles aim systems can play in clinical practice looking particularly to see where clear successes can be identified as well as looking to the future the next chapter will take a more technological focus and look at the way aim systems are built a variety of technologies including expert systems and neural networks will be discussed the final chapter in this section on intelligent decision support will look at the way aim can support the interpretation of patient signals that come off clinical monitoring devicesbox 1 the turing test how will we know when a computer program has achieved an equivalent intelligence to a human is there some set of objective measures that can be assembled against which a computer program can be tested alan turing was one of the founders of modern computer science and ai whose intellectual achievements to this day remain astonishing in their breadth and importance when he came to ponder this question he brilliantly sidestepped the problem almost entirely in his opinion there were no ultimately useful measures of intelligence it was sufficient that an objective observer could not tell the difference in conversation between a human and a computer for us to conclude that the computer was intelligent to cancel out any potential observer biases turings test put the observer in a room equipped with a computer keyboard and screen and made the observer talk to the test subjects only using these the observer would engage in a discussion with the test subjects using the printed word much as one would today by exchanging email with a remote colleague if a set of observers could not distinguish the computer from another human in over 50 of cases then turing felt that one had to accept that the computer was intelligent another consequence of the turing test is that it says nothing about how one builds an intelligent artefact thus neatly avoiding discussions about whether the artefact needed to in anyway mimic the structure of the human brain or our cognitive processes it really didnt matter how the system was built in turings mind its intelligence should only to be assessed based upon its overt behaviour there have been attempts to build systems that can pass turings test in recent years some have managed to convince at least some humans in a panel of judges that they too are human but none have yet passed the mark set by turingin his opinion there were no ultimately useful measures of intelligence it was sufficient that an objective observer could not

and decide how it can be supported in complex or difficult situations for example a fighter pilot may need the help of intelligent systems to assist in flying an aircraft that is too complex for a human to operate on their own these weak ai systems are not intended to have an independent existence but are a form of cognitive prosthesis that supports a human in a variety of tasksaim systems are by and large intended to support healthcare workers in the normal course of their duties assisting with tasks that rely on the manipulation of data and knowledge an ai system could be running within an electronic medical record system for example and alert a clinician when it detects a contraindication to a planned treatment it could also alert the clinician when it detected patterns in clinical data that suggested significant changes in a patients conditionalong with tasks that require reasoning with medical knowledge ai systems also have a very different role to play in the process of scientific research in particular ai systems have the capacity to learn leading to the discovery of new phenomena and the creation of medical knowledge for example a computer system can be used to analyse large amounts of data looking for complex patterns within it that suggest previously unexpected associations equally with enough of a model of existing medical knowledge an ai system can be used to show how a new set of experimental observations conflict with the existing theories we shall now examine such capabilities in more detailexpert or knowledgebased systems are the commonest type of aim system in routine clinical use they contain medical knowledge usually about a very specifically defined task and are able to reason with data from individual patients to come up with reasoned conclusions although there are many variations the knowledge within an expert system is typically represented in the form of a set of rulesthere are many different types of clinical task to which expert systems can be appliedgenerating alerts and remindersdiagnostic assistancetherapy critiquing and planningagents for information retrievalimage recognition and interpretationthere are numerous reasons why more expert systems are not in routine use coiera 1994 some require the existence of an electronic medical record system to supply their data and most institutions and practices do not yet have all their working data available electronically others suffer from poor human interface design and so do not get used even if they are of benefitmuch of the reluctance to use systems simply arose because expert systems did not fit naturally into the process of care and as a result using them required additional effort from already busy individuals it is also true but perhaps dangerous to ascribe some of the reluctance to use early systems upon the technophobia or computer illiteracy of healthcare workers if a system is perceived by those using it to be beneficial then it will be used if not independent of its true value it will probably be rejectedhappily there are today very many systems that have made it into clinical use many of these are small but nevertheless make positive contributions to care in the next two sections we will examine some of the more successful examples of knowledgebased clinical systems in an effort to understand the reasons behind their success and the role they can playin the first decade of aim most research systems were developed to assist clinicians in the process of diagnosis typically with the intention that it would be used during a clinical encounter with a patient most of these early systems did not develop further than the research laboratory partly because they did not gain sufficient support from clinicians to permit their routine introductionit is clear that some of the psychological basis for developing this type of support is now considered less compelling given that situation assessment seems to be a bigger issue than diagnostic formulation some of these systems have continued to develop however and have transformed in part into educational systemsdxplain is an example of one of these clinical decision support systems developed at the massachusetts general hospital barnett et al 1987 it is used to assist in the process of diagnosis taking a set of clinical findings including signs symptoms laboratory data and then produces a ranked list of diagnoses it provides justification for each of differential diagnosis and suggests further investigations the system contains a data base of crude probabilities for over 4500 clinical manifestations that are associated with over 2000 different diseasesdxplain is in routine use at a number of hospitals and medical schools mostly for clinical education purposes but is also available for clinical consultation it also has a role as an electronic medical textbook it is able to provide a description of over 2000 different diseases emphasising the signs and symptoms that occur in each disease and provides recent references appropriate for each specific diseasedecision support systems need not be stand alone but can be deeply integrated into an electronic medical record system indeed such integration reduces the barriers to using such a system by crafting them more closely into clinical working processes rather than expecting workers to create new processes to use themthe help system is an example of this type of knowledgebased hospital information system which began operation in 1980 kuperman et al 1990 kuperman et al 1991 it not only supports the routine applications of a hospital information system his including management of admissions and discharges and order entry but also provides a decision support function the decision support system has been actively incorporated into the functions of the routine his applications decision support provide clinicians with alerts and reminders data interpretation and patient diagnosis facilities patient management suggestions and clinical protocols activation of the decision support is provided within the applications but can also be triggered automatically as clinical data is entered into the patients computerised medical recordone of the most successful areas in which expert systems are applied is in the clinical laboratory practitioners may be unaware that while the printed report they receive from a laboratory was checked by a pathologist the whole report may now have been generated by a computer system that has automatically interpreted the test results examples of such systems include the followingthe puff system for automatic interpretation of pulmonary function tests has been sold in its commercial form to hundreds of sites worldwide snow et al 1988 puff went into production at pacific presbyterian medical centre in san francisco in 1977 making it one of the very earliest medical expert systems in use many thousands of cases later it is still in routine usegermwatcher checks for hospitalacquired nosocomial infections which represent a significant cause of prolonged inpatient days and additional hospital charges kahn et al1993 microbiology culture data from the hospitals laboratory system are monitored by germwatcher using a rulebase containing a combination of national criteria and local hospital infection control policya more general example of this type of system is peirs pathology expert interpretative reporting system edwards et al 1993 during it period of operation peirs interpreted about 80100 reports a day with a diagnostic accuracy of about 95 it accounted for about which 20 of all the reports generated by the hospitals chemical pathology department peirs reported on thyroid function tests arterial blood gases urine and plasma catecholamines hcg human chorionic gonadotrophin and afp alpha fetoprotein glucose tolerance tests cortisol gastrin cholinesterase phenotypes and parathyroid hormone related peptide pthrplaboratory expert systems usually do not intrude into clinical practice rather they are embedded within the process of care and with the exception of laboratory staff clinicians working with patients do not need to interact with them for the ordering clinician the system prints a report with a diagnostic hypothesis for consideration but does not remove responsibility for information gathering examination assessment and treatment for the pathologist the system cuts down the workload of generating reports without removing the need to check and correct reportsall scientists are familiar with the statistical approach to data analysis given a particular hypothesis statistical tests are applied to data to see if any relationships can be found between different parameters machine learning systems can go much further they look at raw data and then attempt to hypothesise relationships within the data and newer learning systems are able to produce quite complex characterisations of those relationships in other words they attempt to discover humanly understandable conceptslearning techniques include neural networks but encompass a large variety of other methods as well each with their own particular characteristic benefits and difficulties for example some systems are able to learn decision trees from examples taken from data quinlan 1986 these trees look much like the classification hierarchies discussed in chapter 10 and can be used to help in diagnosismedicine has formed a rich testbed for machine learning experiments in the past allowing scientists to develop complex and powerful learning systems while there has been much practical use of expert systems in routine clinical settings at present machine learning systems still seem to be used in a more experimental way there are however many situations in which they can make a significant contributionmachine learning systems can be used to develop the knowledge bases used by expert systems given a set of clinical cases that act as examples a machine learning system can produce a systematic description of those clinical features that uniquely characterise the clinical conditions this knowledge can be expressed in the form of simple rules or often as a decision tree a classic example of this type of system is kardio which was developed to interpret ecgs bratko et al 1989this approach can be extended to explore poorly understood areas of medicine and people now talk of the process of data mining and of knowledge discovery systems for example it is possible using patient data to automatically construct pathophysiological models that describe the functional relationships between the various measurements for example hau and coiera 1997 describe a learning system that takes realtime patient data obtained during cardiac bypass surgery and then creates models of normal and abnormal cardiac physiology these models might be used to look for changes in a patients condition if used at the time they are created alternatively if used in a research setting these models can serve as initial hypotheses that can drive further experimentationone particularly exciting development has been the use of learning systems to discover new drugs the learning system is given examples of one or more drugs that weakly exhibit a particular activity and based upon a description of the chemical structure of those compounds the learning system suggests which of the chemical attributes are necessary for that pharmacological activity based upon the new characterisation of chemical structure produced by the learning system drug designers can try to design a new compound that has those characteristics currently drug designers synthesis a number of analogues of the drug they wish to improve upon and experiment with these to determine which exhibits the desired activity by bootstrapping the process using the machine learning approach the development of new drugs can be speeded up and the costs significantly reduced at present statistical analyses of activity are used to assist with analogue development and machine learning techniques have been shown to at least equal if not outperform them as well as having the benefit of generating knowledge in a form that is more easily understood by chemists king et al 1992 since such learning experiments are still in their infancy significant developments can be expected here in the next few yearsmachine learning has a potential role to play in the development of clinical guidelines it is often the case that there are several alternate treatments for a given condition with slightly different outcomes it may not be clear however what features of one particular treatment method are responsible for the better results if databases are kept of the outcomes of competing treatments then machine learning systems can be used to identify features that are responsible for different outcomesshortliffe eh the adolescence of ai

some set of objective measures that can be assembled against which a computer program can be tested alan turing was one of the founders of modern computer science and ai whose intellectual achievements to this day remain astonishing in their breadth and importance when he came to ponder this question he brilliantly sidestepped the problem almost entirely in his opinion there were no ultimately useful measures of intelligence it was sufficient that an objective observer could not tell the difference in conversation between a human and a computer for us to conclude that the computer was intelligent to cancel out any potential observer biases turings test put the observer in a room equipped with a computer keyboard and screen and made the observer talk to the test subjects only using these the observer would engage in a discussion with the test subjects using the printed word much as one would today by exchanging email with a remote colleague if a set of observers could not distinguish the computer from another human in over 50 of cases then turing felt that one had to accept that the computer was intelligent another consequence of the turing test is that it says nothing about how one builds an intelligent artefact thus neatly avoiding discussions about whether the artefact needed to in anyway mimic the structure of the human brain or our cognitive processes it really didnt matter how the system was built in turings mind its intelligence should only to be assessed based upon its overt behaviour there have been attempts to build systems that can pass turings test in recent years some have managed to convince at least some humans in a panel of judges that they too are human but none have yet passed the mark set by turingshortliffe eh the adolescence of ai in medicine will the field come of age in the 90s artif intell med 1993 apr5293106 review pubmed smi artificial intelligence in medicine aim has reached a period of adolescence in which interactions with the outside world are not only natural but mandatory although the basic research topics in aim may be those of artificial intelligence the applied issues touch more generally on the broad field of medical informatics to the extent that aim research is driven by performance goals for biomedicine aim is simply one component within a wide range of research and development activities furthermore an adequate appraisal of aim research requires an understanding of the research motivations the complexity of the problems and a suitable definition of the criteria for judging the fields success effective fielding of aim systems will be dependent on the development of integrated environments for communication and computing that allow merging of knowledgebased tools with other patient datamanagement and informationretrieval applications the creation of this kind of infrastructure will require vision and resources from leaders who realize that the practice of medicine is inherently an informationmanagement task and that biomedicine must make the same kind of coordinated commitment to computing technologies as have other segments of our society in which

referenced in this course and students are encouraged to use these resources to pursue topics of interest after this coursecourse syllabus pagecourse terms of use pageunit 1 introduction to artificial intelligence ai and ai programming while ai applications can be developed in any number of different languages certain language features make programming ai applications straightforward prolog is structured in such a way that ai program development is supported by prolog language features other languages such as java support ai programming through code libraries at this point in your career as a computer science major you have already taken introductory programming courses these should assist you in learning prolog and using code libraries in other languages for ai program development this unit will provide you with an introduction to ai via programming features that support basic ai applications by satisfying the goals of this unit you will have a familiarity with ai programming and be able to use it in future models to implement various ai applications completing this unit should take you approximately 10 hoursunit 2 search previous coursework has familiarized you with searching algorithms in this unit you will learn how to implement standard searching algorithms we will first discuss the motivation behind exploring search from an ai perspective learning new terminology as we go that will be used in this unit and beyond we will then learn about basic search methods as well as time and memory requirements concluding with a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of searching algorithms by the end of this unit you will be able to apply ai techniques when developing searching algorithms completing this unit should take you approximately 12 hoursunit 3 constraint satisfaction ai applications are built upon the idea of a problem statement with constraints in ai we must work within those constraints in order to develop an optimal solution in this unit we will define problem in specific ai terms and discuss different approaches to constraint satisfaction constraint satisfaction is an important subject area within ai the famous map coloring problem has simple variables and simple constraints and is thus useful in illustrating the basics of constraint satisfaction by the end of this unit you will be able to solve basic problems completing this unit should take you approximately 10 hoursunit 4 game playing some of the earliest and most recognizable ai applications are games like chess and tictactoe the most famous being the chess match between garry kasparov and deep blue in this unit we will discuss the development of gameplaying applications as well as the relationship between gameplaying and searching algorithms the unit will also provide you with some best practices for building game programs this unit has been designed to teach you how to design algorithms for gameplaying applications for our purposes you will find tictactoe which uses features of search and constraint satisfaction the simplest we suggest that as an informal exercise you create a tictactoe application and then play against it noting the algorithms success rates and determining which modifications will need to be implemented in order to improve its performance completing this unit should take you approximately 10 hoursunit 5 logic we have already briefly discussed logic but this unit will provide you with a more formal definition we will learn about two main types of logicpropositional and firstorder prolog was designed for expressing logic this unit gives you a strong foundation in logic so that you will be able to use or learn prolog more easily to program logic applications similarly you will be able to use or learn class libraries that support ai techniques in other languages like c and java completing this unit should take you approximately 24 hoursunit 6 machine learning machine learning refers to computer programs that are able to categorize data in order to maximize understanding of that information machine learning is closely related to statistics and modeling and has a wide range of applications from natural language processing searching robotics and indexing to other pattern recognition applications this unit will begin by defining machine learning its applications and a number of other important terms that will be used in this unit we will then go over the three main classes of machine learning supervised learning semisupervised learning and unsupervised learning you will also end up with an introductory foundation in machine learning that will be useful for further academic study in the field completing this unit should take you approximately 26 hoursunit 7 natural language understanding this unit will provide you with a basic introduction to natural language understanding nlu in ai syntax semantics and ambiguity of natural language are discussed simple examples are presented some of what we

help them to build their wealth to build their net worth and to be able to achieve the kind of financial goals that they’ve set out for themselves” louis b mendelsohn creator of vantagepointartificial intelligence ai is said to have had its humble beginning in 1956 at a summerlong conference called the dartmouth summer research project on artificial intelligence the purpose of the conference was to investigate which aspects of human learning could be ‘programmed into thinking machines’ the precursor to computers the intent was to find ways for these thinking machines to solve problems and learn from their mistakes just as humans dosince then artificial intelligence has not so quietly been the engine behind transformative changes in how people think make buying decisions and relate to one

reshaping nearly every industry and government worldwidenow with more than 60 years of progress this transformative technology is poised to make the difference between growth and decline for businesses worldwide as it disrupts and transforms practically every aspect of the human experience touched by technologyartificial intelligence as it’s been understood to date by the public conjures up fearful images of armies of robots rising up and challenging humankind for supremacy in intelligence as well as in physical prowess taken to its logical extreme this doomsday perspective of this incredible predictive technology has been widely promoted over the years in science fiction books and in big screen horror movies while such fears are not entirely unfounded they are at this point in history quite premature given the current stateoftheart in artificial intelligenceyet despite these concerns and even fear of where this technology will take us over the next century artificial intelligence has not so quietly been the engine behind transformative changes in how people think make buying decisions and relate to one another in a way which has been redefining the very definition of community friendship and every other aspect of social discourse these changes to date have been mainly due to the application of ai to such areas as facial recognition and speech recognition within the overall general arena known as pattern recognition“i want to share with you my enthusiasm for a trading software program called vantagepoint which was the first commercially available fullytrained aibased market forecasting tool in the world”it is no secret that artificial intelligence is the super power behind vantagepoint trading software thanks to our founder who discovered that artificial neural networks applied to the financial markets if designed and trained properly really work ai is what allows the software to provide traders with highly accurate predictive forecasts of primary markets based on their relationships with related markets that affect the underlying price movements of the primary markets this is something that is not possible without artificial intelligencein vantagepoint’s application which forecasts thousands of global financial markets artificial neural networks had to be delicately trained in order to learn the relationships between each specific primary market and its related intermarkets that influence the trend direction of each primary market in hidden patterns these hidden patterns are not detectable by a human being but detectable only

applies machine learning to update those recommendations after learning the subscriber’s interests and habits what they watch how long they watch it for and what they don’t watchdeep learningdeep learning is a more sophisticated refinement of machine learning the key difference is that it can learn on its own independently through iterative learning or training process similar to how the human brain processes information and arrive at intelligent decisionsdeep learning models must organize its processes into structured layers that form an ‘artificial neural network’ that can learn from the data it was presented with and can make intelligent decisions and informed predictions based on what it has learnedartificial neural networksartificial neural networks anns are modeled after human brains to best mimic this process a major reason why deep learning with artificial neural networks has become so popular recently is that they are powered by huge amounts of data which increases their ability to learn from that data and make highly accurate forecaststhere have been considerable advancements made in computing hardware related to how anns crunch its data which has sparked renewed interest in artificial intelligence and its applications in numerous industries such as medicinemore recently internetconnected cloud computing technology emerged in which neural network software code

disclosures that companies make about their csr activities we can derive some insights into how ai is transforming corporate sustainability activity using keyword searches in esg trends a dataset of corporate sustainability disclosures we looked across thousands of csr reports and cdp disclosures from large global companies to see what if anything companies are disclosing about the impact of artificial intelligence this analysis below which measures mentions of ai in corporate sustainability reports and cdp filings can help us start to answer the question what does ai mean for sustainabilitywhat we see is that ai is already having an impact on corporate sustainability activity companies already are making use of ai to achieve step changes in for example efficiency and emissions reductions and to innovate new products and services these ai applications for sustainability are not widespread and they are early stage but the data suggests that ai can bring significant benefits for sustainability in the medium term what we don’t see however is much evidence that companies are understanding the numerous and serious risks that ai presentsthe vast majority of the mentions of artificial intelligence in csr reports and cdp filings relate to how ai presents opportunities for companies ai is helping the next generation of companies reduce their environmental and social impact by improving efficiency and developing new productswe can look first at utility company xcel energy when the company creates electricity from burning coal at its two plants in texas one major byproduct is a potent greenhouse gas called nitrous oxide nitrous oxide emissions contribute to climate change as well as harming the ozone layerrecently the company has received a little extra help in reducing its emissions from artificial intelligence xcel has equipped its smokestacks in texas with neural networks an advanced artificial intelligence that simulates a human brain the neural network quickly can analyze the data that results from the complex dynamics of coal combustion it then can make highly accurate recommendations about how to adjust the plant’s operations to reduce nitrous oxide emissions and operate at peak efficiency neural networks have helped xcel energy — and over a hundred other companies around the world — reduce their nitrous oxide emissions a report from the international energy agency estimated that artificial intelligence control systems such as xcel energy’s neural networks could reduce nitrous oxide emissions by 20 percent ai applications for sustainability are early stage but the data suggests they can bring significant benefits in the medium termai applications for sustainability are early stage but the data suggests they can bring significant benefits in the medium termanother example is google the search giant recently hit a wall in improving data center efficiency the company had optimized its data center energy use to a point where engineers felt it could not be improved much more then one of its engineers had an idea to deploy a machine learning model developed for another application to assist in optimizing efficiency in its data centersgoogle deployed the artificial model to learn when and why certain processes occurred in the data center based on this data google’s algorithms were able to identify options for significant additional savings google’s application of ai has helped to reduce the amount of energy used for cooling data centers by 40 percent — good for the company’s bottom line and good for the planetartificial intelligence is also enabling companies to develop new products and services that were unthinkable just a few years ago in some of these cases companies are deploying artificial intelligence directly to help them make progress on tough environmental and social challengesibm for example is using its artificial intelligence expertise to improve weather forecasting and renewable energy predictions the system known as smt uses machine learning big data and analytics to continuously analyze learn from and improve solar forecasts derived from a large number of weather models through the application of artificial intelligence and cognitive computing ibm can generate demand forecasts that are 30 percent more accurate this type of forecasting can help utilities with large renewable installations better manage their energy load maximize renewable energy production and reduce greenhouse gas emissionsone of the bestknown examples of artificial intelligence in action is in autonomous vehicles cars that drive themselves may offer a promising sustainability future currently onequarter of us greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation machines will be more efficient at driving than humans engines in machinedriven cars can be smaller using less gasoline and autonomous vehicles can platoon together just inches from one another improving efficiency and leaving more space on the road for cyclists public transport or pedestrians google uber tesla ford nissan and other companies are working hard to develop selfdriving carsit is not just tech companies that see report sustainabilityrelated opportunities from ai interserve for example a ftselisted construction company builds and manages sensitive facilities including schools hospitals and clinical facilities where operational safety is critical the company uses realtime data to alert personnel when dangerous waterborne pathogens such as legionnaire’s bacteria develop the company reported that it is exploring artificial intelligence to predict when these diseases will occur so it can fix issues before they develop increasing safety and saving on maintenance costsinterserve’s work alongside that of xcel energy google ibm and other companies shows that ai has the potential to provide a major technological boost to help companies achieve sustainability goalshowever ai applications for sustainability are in their infancy only a small percentage of the thousands of companies we analyzed mention artificial intelligence at all in their csr disclosures and as ai scales to create more sustainability opportunity companies also will have to navigate the risksjudging from their official disclosures companies are eager to embrace the opportunities presented by ai they also appear remarkably unconcerned about the risks in a review of more than 8000 csr reports and cdp disclosures over the last two years we failed to find more than a handful of mentions of the risks to companies that ai posesone sustainabilityrelated risk that ai poses is automated bias bias can happen when the machine learns to identify patterns in data and make recommendations based on for example race gender or age as ai algorithms do more analysis companies must be diligent in ensuring that their algorithms analyze data and make predictions in a fair way one sustainabilityrelated risk that ai poses is automated biasone sustainabilityrelated risk that ai poses is automated biasfor example credit scoring companies such as transunion use artificial intelligence to analyze a variety of data points to determine credit worthiness undiagnosed bias in such algorithms could lead to poor credit scores for groups of people based in part on gender or race which is expressly prohibited by law and could expose the company to legal claims what is a company’s policy toward algorithmic decisions are the company’s algorithms certified by a thirdparty to be biasfree these are essential questions that companies should begin assessing and disclosing nowanother risk from ai is that the sustainability benefits that companies tout — such as major efficiency breakthroughs and clean selfdriving cars — may not materialize or may be offset by other consequences of aifor example some studies suggest that the environmental benefits from selfdriving cars may turn out to be mixed at best machines driving our cars for example may lead to people making more trips which could lead to increases in emissions not decreasesanother major risk for the planet is that largescale implementation of artificial intelligence may eat all of our jobs leading to widespread unemployment a recent report estimated that automation will replace 6 percent of us jobs by 2021 with further job reductions coming in the medium term a world without jobs presents a host of new uncharted challenges for sustainability few of which we can predictartificial intelligence is already here it will continue to gain in complexity and sophistication it presents excellent opportunities for efficiencies and innovation many of which were unthinkable just a few years agomany of these innovations will allow us to make significant progress on the most difficult environmental and social problems facing humans at the same time these same efficiencies and innovations bring with them new risks such as automated bias and largescale job losses more companies quickly must come to grips with both the sustainability opportunities and risks that ai bringsview

machine learning are an increasingly integral part of many industries including marketingbut while we often talk about using or incorporating ai in marketing what do we really mean by that what does it look like in practicehere are 15 examples of ai and machine learning in action in the marketing industry ps remember to check out econsultancy’s marketer’s guide to machine learning and aithe practice of clustering customer behaviours to predict future behaviours began way back in 1998 with a report on ‘digital bookshelves’ by jussi karlgren a swedish computational linguist at columbia university in the same year amazon began using “collaborative filtering” to enable recommendations for millions of customersfast forward to 2019 and some of the most successful digital companies have built their product offerings around the ability to provide highly relevant and personalised product or content recommendations – including amazon netflix and spotify as lori goldberg wrote in a brief history of artificial intelligence in advertising for econsultancy “this all comes from aibased clustering and interpreting of consumer data paired with profile information and demographics these aibased systems continually adapt to your likes and dislikes and react with new recommendations tailored in realtime”other major brands are now following suit with their own aipowered recommendations for example sky has implemented a machine learning model that is designed to recommend content according to the viewer’s mood as customers become used to the level of personalised recommendations provided by services like netflix and spotify they look for other brands to provide the same experiencepublishers are also implementing aipowered content recommendation widgets that can identify related content to surface to readers and even personalise those recommendations based on readers’ browsing habits we recently introduced a feature like this on econsultancy our ‘recommended’ sidebar is powered by a tool called idio which learns our readers’ interests as they browse and uses this to suggest articles that they might be interested in readinghow to boost conversion rates by 32 a recommendation engine case studymarketing is becoming an increasingly datadriven discipline and more effective use of data is the key to improving customer experience personalisation targeting and morehowever consolidating that data at scale once it has been collected and analysing it to determine patterns is tedious and difficult for human beings this is where ai comes in one of the great strengths of ai in the workplace is its ability to take on complex organisational and analysis tasks that would be difficult or impossible for humans to carry out freeing up humans to do the more intuitive creative work that they are better suited tofor example ai can be used to improve account selection in accountbased marketing when abm is carried out at scale targeting and personalisation company demandbase found that it could use ai to filter out companies from its list of prospects that would ultimately lose the company money in the long run as jessica fewless the company’s vp of abm strategy told the b2b marketing conference“we’re a statsbased company and if they churn from us in less than a year we lose money on them so we took the elements that made those customers churn and removed them from our model” she saidai proved to be most useful for demandbase in identifying ‘timely intent’ highlighting the accounts where there is a window of opportunity to approach before a commitment to a competitor is madeai has had a profound impact on the way that we search and the quality of the search experience that we often tend to take for granted in 2019google first started innovating with ai in search in 2015 with the introduction of rankbrain its machine learningbased algorithm since then many ecommerce websites including amazon have followed in google’s footsteps and incorporated ai into their search engines to make product searching smarterwith innovations like natural language processing and semantic search search engines can determine the links between products and suggest similar items find relevant search results and autocorrect mistakes helping consumers to discover products even if they don’t know exactly what they’re looking forthree great product search experiences powered by machine learningsimilarly advances in ai image recognition and analysis are making it possible to achieve amazing things with visual searchwhile it’s still early days for the technology visual search – the act of using search to find results that are visually similar to one another in the same way that “traditional” textbased search finds results of a similar topic – is becoming more commonplace thanks to platforms like pinterest and technology like google lensvisual search has a number of useful applications in marketing and retail for example it can be used to improve merchandising and personalise the shopping experience instead of recommending products based on a shopper’s past behaviour or purchases visual search technology can recommend relevant products based on how they look helping shoppers to find items of a similar or complementary styletarget and asos are two retailers that have made a big commitment to visual search as part of their ecommerce experience target launched a partnership with pinterest in 2017 that integrated pinterest lens pinterest’s visual search tool for the physical world into target’s app allowing shoppers to snap a photo of a product while out and about and find similar items on target’s websiteasos’ style match visual search tool works in a similar way allowing shoppers to take a picture or upload an image and search asos’ product catalogue for items or similar items contained within that image these tools encourage shoppers to treat retailers as goto destinations for items that they might see in a magazine or while out and about helping them to shop for the perfect product even if they don’t know what it isfinally image recognition is also giving marketers an edge on social media by allowing them to find uses of brand products and logos and identify visual trends this is called ‘visual social listening’ and it can allow brands to spot where and how customers are interacting with their brand logo or product even when it’s not referred to by namehow visual social listening is helping fmcg and beyondadvances in natural language processing have proven extremely useful for marketers wanting to analyse their brand presence and the conversations around their brand on social media and use those to target campaignsai allows brands to perform sentiment analysis on social conversations and understand the prevailing attitude towards their brand and products this can allow them to spot potential issues and counteract them before they become too widespread for example samsung – which works with ai consumer insights company crimson hexagon – was able to detect and counteract customer dissatisfaction with a red tint on the screen of its newlyreleased s8 smartphone model thanks to social listeningcareful with samsung s8 as i read yesterday some south koreans have bought s8 models that have a red tint on the display are disappointed— søren pio nissen sorenpio april 22 2017galaxy s8 red screen tint issue and potential fix has been confirmed by samsung samsung s8 samsungs8 httpstco0gfqo3eu0r pictwittercommtrxsz6cpp— standa dvořák stanik april 19 2017how samsung uses social listening for product marketing sentiment analysissocial listening and sentiment analysis can also be used to spot purchase intent by analysing the ways that consumers are talking about a product – for example “in the market for a new phone samsung s8 anyone how does it hold up” or “borrowed my boyfriend’s ipad and now i’m thinking about getting one…” – which can enable marketers to target them with advertising or potentially a strategicallyplaced discountwith that said marketers should tread lightly with this kind of targeting or risk appearing creepysome online retailers and aggregators have discovered the extent to which machine learning can make the process of tagging and categorising products more efficient stuart mcclure founder of lovethesalescom spoke to econsultancy editor ben davis to explain how and why the company uses ai for product categorisation“one retailer might give us amazing data and another could give us the same set of products but with awful data we use a textbased classification tool training various models with both positive and negative examples”this means that even if different language is used by different retailers to describe the same product – for example “trainer” “basketball shoe” and “sneaker” – the algorithm is able to understand that the products are the same and tag them accordingly this can be so effective as to allow the algorithm to correctly identify a product based on nothing but context“the really cool thing is we’ll have examples loads of them where you’ll get say 100 shirts and there’ll be a piece of data that has nothing in it at all to say it’s a shirt but the model has classified it correctly as a shirt because of the surrounding context” mcclure told econsultancydemandbased price changes are nothing new – think changes to hotel room rates depending on the season – but with ai entering the equation prices can be determined and optimised with a whole new level of precision taking a wide variety of data into accountmachine learning can be used for things like dynamic pricing which analyses a customer’s data patterns and predicts what they are likely to be willing to pay and also their receptiveness to special offers this allows businesses to target them with more precision and calculate the exact level of discount needed or not needed to pull in a saledynamic pricing can also be used to compare businesses’ product pricing with that of their competitors to determine if their pricing is too high about the same or too lowairbnb is one brand that has built and refined an extremely sophisticated dynamic pricing system to help property owners determine the price that they should list their property at it takes into account a wide variety of factors including geographic location listing features local events photographs and reviews as well as market demand and time to booking datethese calculations are provided to users as ‘price tips’ which they will choose to follow or ignore the system will then monitor whether or not the listing succeeds and adjust its algorithm based on the results you can read more about this intriguing system and how it was developed in this profile published by ieee spectrumpredictive analytics the practice of extracting information from data sets to predict future trends can be used to great effect in improving customer service and customer experiencepredictive analytics are a revolutionary capability of ai because it was previously only possible to retroactively determine trends from data sets thanks to artificial intelligence things that could once only be determined retroactively can now be reliably modelled and decisions made based on those modelspredictive analytics can be used in ecommerce to analyse customers’ purchase behaviour and determine when they might be likely to make a repeat purchase or to purchase something new using predictive analytics marketers can “reverseengineer” customers’ experiences and actions to determine which marketing strategies resulted in a positive outcomecompanies like fedex and sprint are also using predictive analytics to pinpoint customers who are “flight risk” factors and may defect to a competitorin customer service predictive analytics can be used to anticipate high or low call volumes and ensure that phone lines and other outlets are staffed sufficientlyfor marketers to reach their customers with the level of personalisation that many have come to expect they need to target increasingly granular segmentsai can be used to achieve this drawing on the data that marketers already have about their customers machine learning algorithms can be trained against a “gold standard” training set to identify important variables and common properties and even pick out incorrectly identified contactsthe extent to which marketers can segment their consumers comes down to the data that they have – segments can be as simple as gender and age or as complex as past behaviours and buying personassegmentation also doesn’t have to be static dynamic segmentation is an application of ai that takes into account the fact that customers’ behaviours are rarely fixed or unchanging and that people can take on different personas at different times for different reasonsfor example if a young person browses for a gift for an older relative dynamic segmentation will group them in with the segment most appropriate to their current buying behaviour using realtime data presenting the most relevant offers and avoiding using outdated data for targetingthe introduction of artificial intelligence has made bidding on and targeting programmatic advertising vastly more efficient again this is tied into predictive analytics and the ability to model things that could previously only be determined retroactivelywhen applied to programmatic advertising ai can determine things like the best time of day to serve an ad the probability of an impression converting or the likelihood of a user engaging with an ad that appears in the middle of an article they are readingai can also be used to adjust bidding strategies based on customer lifetime value clv and invest more in potentially highervalue customerssales forecasting is another predictionbased application of ai – this time for salesusing past sales data industrywide comparisons and economic trends artificial intelligence can forecast sales outcomes and help companies to inform business decisions and predict short and longterm performancesales forecasts can also help to estimate product demand although sales teams should be careful to take other factors into account as well for example a company experiencing manufacturing issues may only sell a certain number of units due to a lack of stock not due to a lack of demand for the product thus using only sales figures to predict demand would produce an inaccurate forecastover the past few years the chatbot star has risen dramatically and then fallen even more dramatically as a oncehyped application of ai was found not to work as well as many had hopedhowever a number of companies are still successfully using chatbots at a recent econsultancy digital outlook event in singapore marketing ai expert deborah kay spoke of the popularity of singapore’s ‘bus uncle’ chat platform which uses facebook messenger to give information on bus arrival times and responds to natural language queriesother brands have begun to build conversational voice experiences placing a bet on voice interfaces and voiceenabled devices as the future of brand interaction trainline a travel company with a number of apps that incorporate ai recently launched a voice app for the google assistant in an interview with econsultancy editor ben davis trainline’s director of engineering jonathan midgley called the app “the uk’s most advanced rail voice ai with 12 levels of conversation depth” the app improves itself through machine learning and becomes more accurate the more commuters make use of itover the past several years voiceactivated devices and their potential have become the talk ha of the marketing industrythis is possible due to advances in speech recognition technology as well as things like natural language processing in 2017 google’s level of speech recognition accuracy reached the coveted 95 threshold while in the same year baidu claimed to have reached a 97 accuracy rate with speech recognition – and is aiming for 99while speech recognition is only one component of a good voice experience it does play an important rule in making sure that voice interfaces and voice interactions function smoothly and that users’ requests are interpreted correctlycomputer vision much as the name implies is a discipline that involves programming computers to ‘see’ the world around them and gain a high level of understanding from digital images and videostrue computer vision is only achievable with ai machine learning and huge datasets with which to train a machine to recognise and identify objectsaccurate computer vision is important for the sophisticated development of augmented reality ar and particularly for its applications in marketing the better computers can detect and identify the physical world the more accurately and usefully augmented reality can be overlaid on top of itthis enables ar advertising that integrates with people’s surroundings in a way that is relevant without being intrusive and can open up new possibilities for things like interactive shopping product insights and offers and business informationso far augmented reality has been deployed to great effect in a marketing context by home improvement and furniture companies like home depot lowe’s and ikea in 2015 home depot launched an augmented reality app called project color that allowed users to visualise how different paint colours would look on their wallssince 2013 it has also offered augmented reality features within its mobile app that allow shoppers to view how products like doors patio furniture vanity units and faucets would look in their home lowe’s and ikea offer similar functionality with furnishings and lowe’s has also developed an app called measured which – as the name implies – can measure an object or distance using augmented reality a useful tool for diybeauty brands are also deploying ar to great effect to engage consumers and drive return purchases brands including lancôme l’oreal estée lauder and sephora have created augmented reality experiences that allow people to virtually try on lipstick or nail varnish provide personalised product recommendations and even carry out a full makeover via ar educating consumers about the products they need and how to apply themlurking behind a good half of the articles published about ai is the implicit question will the robots be taking all our jobsmost of the use cases for ai that we’ve so far covered in this article consist of artificial intelligence either augmenting a tool or performing a role which aids a human in their daytoday workhowever one job that ai is becoming able to perform in its own right is copywriting at the moment ai’s copywriting skills in the realm of marketing are largely limited to basic tasks with limited parameters like email subject lines and product descriptionsone wellknown vendor in this space is phrasee the company prides itself on being able to produce email subject lines that are indistinguishable from those written by humans – even using emoji correctly – and has recently moved into the realm of social ad copy on facebook and instagramhow wowcher used ai copywriting to reduce facebook ad cpl by 31chinese tech giant alibaba claims to have developed an ai copywriting tool that “passes the turing test” but it’s unclear whether the ai has actually been put through a quantitative test or whether this is just a turn of phrase to signify that the ai can pass for human even then it still isn’t being used to produce complex copy but mostly produces ads and retail product descriptions for websites like taobao and tmallhowever something much bigger may be just around the corner earlier this month the nonprofit company openai backed by elon musk revealed that it had created an artificially intelligent text generator called gpt2 which is so accurate the company is holding back from releasing the research until it has had more of a chance to investigate how the technology might be abusedjournalistic outlets including reuters and the washington post are already employing ‘robot reporters’ to churn out reports on company earnings and sports scores based on structured data while these articles are still very formulaic in nature the creation of gpt2 – which has demonstrated its ability to perfectly replicate the tone of individual columnists – suggests that something much more ‘human’ is possiblewhether this ai will be capable of comprehending the finer points of seo or martech and thus take over writing blog posts like this one from human copywriters or editors remains to be seen for now it seems that gpt2 is mostly capable of mimicking rather than devising original ideas and executing them – but it mimics very very wellwe’ve found plenty of examples of ways that ai is transforming the ways that we work shop market and sell allowing us to achieve things that would never have been possible without it however ai is by no means allpowerfulit’s worth pointing out that ai and machine learning still need people such as google’s raters to improve their accuracy and to train algorithms properlycrowdsourcing of a workforce eg amazon’s mechanical turk will perhaps become a bigger industry as more ai brings a need for a human’s guiding hand to adjust datasetsin addition to this ai has yet to dramatically reshape most businesses to the extent that many expected it would brian bergstein published an insightful recent writeup for the mit technology review examining why this is in it he wrote“ai might eventually transform the economy—by making new products and new business models possible by predicting things humans couldn’t have foreseen and by relieving employees of drudgery but that could take longer than hoped or feared depending on where you sit …“this doesn’t necessarily mean that ai is overhyped it’s just that when it comes to reshaping how business gets done patternrecognition algorithms are a small part of what matters far more important are organizational elements that ripple from the it department all the way to the front lines of a business pretty much everyone has to be attuned to how ai works and where its blind spots are especially the people who will be expected to trust its judgments all this requires not just money but also patience meticulousness and other quintessentially human skills that too often are in short supply”econsultancy offers training in many marketing disciplines includingin spite of

commonly abbreviated as ai also known as machine intelligence may be defined as making a machine behave in ways that would be called intelligent if a human were so behaving this definition was put forth by john mccarthy in his 1955 proposal for the dartmouth summer research project on artificial intelligence since that time several distinct types of artificial intelligence have been elucidated strong artificial intelligence deals with the creation of some form of computerbased artificial intelligence that can truly reason and solve problems a strong form of ai is said to be sentient or selfaware in theory there are two types of strong ai humanlike ai in which the computer program thinks and reasons much like a human mind nonhumanlike ai in which the computer program develops a totally nonhuman sentience and a nonhuman way of thinking and reasoning weak artificial intelligence deals with the creation of some form of computerbased artificial intelligence that can not truly reason and solve problems such a machine would in some ways act as if it were intelligent but it would not posesses true intelligence or sentience to date much of the work in this field has been done with computer simulations of intelligence based on predefined sets of rules very little progress has been made in strong ai depending on how one defines ones goals a moderate amount of progress has been made in weak ai table of contents showtoctoggleshowhide 1 development of ai theory 2 experimental ai research 3 practical applications of ai techniques 4 hypothetical consequences of ai 5 subfields of ai research 6 computer programs displaying some degree of intelligence 7 artificial intelligence in literature and movies 8 speculative nonfiction books about artificial intelligence 9 see also 10 external links development of ai theory much of the original focus of artificial intelligence research draws from an experimental approach to psychology and emphasizes what may be called linguistic intelligence best exemplified in the turing test approaches to artificial intelligence that do not focus on linguistic intelligence include robotics and collective intelligence approaches which focus on active manipulation of an environment or consensus decision making and draw from biology and political science when seeking models of how intelligent behavior is organized artificial intelligence theory also draws from animal studies in particular with insects which are easier to emulate as robots see artificial life or with apes who resemble humans in many ways but have less developed capacities for planning and cognition ai researchers argue that animals which are simpler than humans ought to be considerably easier to mimic seminal papers advancing the concept of machine intelligence include a logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity 1943 by warren mcculloch and walter pitts and on computing machinery and intelligence 1950 by alan turing and mancomputer symbiosis by jcr licklider see cybernetics and turing test for further discussion there were also early papers which denied the possibility of machine intelligence on logical or philosophical grounds such as minds machines and gödel 1961 by john lucas with the development of practical techniques based on ai research advocates of ai have argued that opponents of ai have repeatedly changed their position on tasks such as computer chess or speech recognition that were previously regarded as intelligent in order to deny the accomplishments of ai they point out that this moving of the goalposts effectively defines intelligence as whatever humans can do that machines cannot john von neumann quoted by et jaynes anticipated this in 1948 by saying in response to a comment at a lecture that it was impossible for a machine to think you insist that there is something a machine cannot do if you will tell me precisely what it is that a machine cannot do then i can always make a machine which will do just that von neumann was presumably alluding to the churchturing thesis which states that any effective procedure can be simulated by a generalized computer 1969 mccarthy

building systems and then improving them through some automatic process rather than systematically designing something to complete the task both approaches appeared very early in ai history throughout the 1960s and 1970s scruffy approaches were pushed to the background but interest was regained in the 1980s when the limitations of the neat approaches of the time became clearer however it has become clear that contemporary methods using both broad aproaches have severe limitations practical applications of ai techniques whilst progress towards the ultimate goal of humanlike intelligence has been

may be defined as making a machine behave in ways that would be called intelligent if a human were so behaving this definition was put forth by john mccarthy in his 1955 proposal for the dartmouth summer research project on artificial intelligence since that time several distinct types of artificial intelligence have been elucidated strong artificial intelligence deals with the creation of some form of computerbased artificial intelligence that can truly reason and solve problems a strong form of ai is said to be sentient or selfaware in theory there are two types of strong ai humanlike ai in which the computer program thinks and reasons much like a human mind nonhumanlike ai in which the computer program develops a totally nonhuman sentience and a nonhuman way of thinking and reasoning weak artificial intelligence deals with the creation of some form of computerbased artificial intelligence that can not truly reason and solve problems such a machine would in some ways act as if it were intelligent but it would not posesses true intelligence or sentience to date much of the work in this field has been done with computer simulations of intelligence based on predefined sets of

that were previously regarded as intelligent in order to deny the accomplishments of ai they point out that this moving of the goalposts effectively defines intelligence as whatever humans can do that

branch of computer science that studies the computational requirements for tasks such as perception reasoning and learning and develop systems to perform those tasks the field of artificial intelligence strives to understand and build intelligent entities ai strong ai mc can think and act like human weak ai some thinking like features can be added to mc slide 4 introduction turing test intelligence is defined as the ability to achieve human level performance in all cognitive tests sufficient to fool a human interrogator the test was devised in response to the question” can a computer think ” result was ve if interrogator can not tell if responses are coming from the mc or human proposed by alan turing1950 a british computer scientist slide 5 introduction turing test one person sits at a computer and types the questions the computer is connected to two other hidden computers at one computer human reads and responds to questions at the other end computer with no human aid runs the program to provide responses slide 6 introduction definitions ai is a branch of computer science dealing with symbolic nonalgorithmic methods of problem solving ai is a branch of computer science that deals with ways of knowledge using symbols rather than numbers and with heuristics method for processing information ai works with pattern matching methods which attempt to describe objects events or processes in terms of their qualitative features and logical and computational relationship slide 7 introduction what is intelligence to respond to situations very flexibly to make sense out of ambiguous or contradictory messages to recognize the relative importance of different elements of situations to find similarities between situations despite difference to draw distinctions between situations despite similarities which may link them slide 8 history 1943 – mcculloh and pitts boolean circuit model of brain 1950 – turing’s computing machine and intelligence 1950’s – early ai programs including samuel’s checker program newell and simon’s logic theorist gelisnters geometry engine 1956 – dartmouth conference slide 9 history 195269 – “look ma no hands” era 1958 – mccarthy moves to mit lisp was born 1965 – robinson’s complete algorithm for logical reasoning 196674 – ai discovers computational complex neural network research almost disappears 196979 early development in knowledge based systems slide 10 history 198088 expert system industry booms 198893 expert system industry busts 198588 neural networks return to popularity 1995 agents… agents… agents present branches branches logical ai what a program knows about the world in general the facts of the specific situation in which it must act and it’s goal are all represented by sentences of some mathematical logical language pattern recognition when a program makes observation of some kind it is often programmed to compare what it sees with already stored patterns branches branches representation facts about the world have to be represented in some way usually languages of mathematical logic are used common sense knowledge and reasoning this is an era in which ai is farthest from human level while there has been considerable progress eg in development systems of non monotonic reasoning and theories of action branches branches planning planning programs start with general facts about the world they generate a strategy for achieving the goal the strategy is just a sequence of action epistemology this is a study of the kinds of knowledge that are required for solving problems in the world ontology it is the study of kinds of things that exist in ai things deal with various kinds of object branches branches heuristics heuristics is a way of trying to discover something or an idea embedded in a program it predicates that compare two nodes in a search tree to see if one is better than other ei constitutes an advance towards the goal may be more useful genetic engineering it is a technique for getting programs to solve a task by mating random lisp programs and selecting fittest in millions of generations applications of ai applications of ai expert systems natural language processing nlp speech recognition computer vision robotics automatic programming applications applications expert systems an expert system is a computer program designed to act as an expert in a particular domain area of expertise expert systems currently are designed to assist experts not to replace them they have been used in medical diagnosis chemical analysis geological explorations etc domain of es knowledge base facts heuristics phases in expert system applications applications speech recognition the primary interactive method of communication used by humans is not reading and writing it is speech the goal of speech recognition research is to allow computers to understand human speech so that they can hear our voices and recognize the words we are speaking it simplifies the process of interactive communication between people and computers thus it advances the goal of nlp applications applications natural language processing the goal of nlp is to enable people and computers to communicate in a natural humanly languagesuch as english rather than in a computer language the field of nlp is divided in 2 categories— natural language understanding natural language generation applications applications computer vision people generally use vision as their primary means of sensing their environment we generally see more than we hear feel or smell or taste the goal of computer vision research is to give computers this same powerful facility for understanding their surrounding here ai helps computer to understand what they see through attached cameras applications applications robotics a robot is a electromechanical device that can by programmed to perform manual tasks or a reprogrammable multi functional manipulator designed to move materials parts tools or specialized devices through variable programmed motions for performance of variety of tasks an ‘intelligent’ robot includes some kind of sensory apparatus that allows it to respond to change in it’s environment slide 21 applications robotics applications applications automatic programming programming is a process of telling a computer exactly what you want it to dowriting a program is a tedious job it must be designed written tested debugged and evaluated the goal of automatic planning is to create special programs that act intelligent tools to assist programmers and expedite each phase of programming process ultimate aim is computer itself should develop a program in accordance with specifications of programmer future future the day is not far when you will just sit back in your cozy little beds and just command your personal robots to entirely do your ruts he will be a perfect companion for you just enjoy the technology future future but wait don’t be happy it may end in other way too some day there will be a knock to your door as you open it you see a large number of robots marching into your house destroying everything you own and looting you this is because ever since there is an advantage in the technology it attracts antisocial elements this is true for robots too because now they will have full power to think as human even as of antisocial elements so think trice before giving them power of cognition conclusion conclusion in it’s short existence ai has increased understanding of the nature of intelligence and provided an impressive array of application in a wide range of areas it has sharpened understanding of human reasoning and of the nature of intelligence in general at the same time it has revealed the complexity of modeling human reasoning providing new areas and rich challenges for the future slide 26 thank youenter one or more tags separated by comma or enter numeric tags are not allowedincluded

to the last time you chatted online with a customer service agent maybe you were complaining about receiving the wrong item in your order it’s highly possible that the person on the other end trying to solve your problem wasn’t a person at all you might have been speaking with an artificial intelligence chatbot essentially a talking robotartificial intelligence has made chatbots more lifelike than ever before and they are becoming pervasive talking bots are taking pizza orders reserving hotel rooms and scheduling appointments in short these robots are all around usto maximize the ability of artificial intelligence ai chatbots to improve service save money and increase engagement businesses and organizations need to understand how these programs work and what they can do in this guide you’ll get a crash course on talking bots including the technology behind them how they have transformed marketing and customer service and how you can start putting them to worklet’s start with the basicsa chatbot is a computer program that imitates human conversation — spoken written or both chatbots conduct conversations with people and developers typically hope that users will not realize they’re actually talking to a robotthe term chatbot comes from “chatterbot” a name coined by inventor michael mauldin in 1994 he created julia the first chatbot made with verbot a popular software program and development kit today ai chatbots are also known by many other names talkbot bot im bot intelligent chatbot conversation bot ai conversation bot talking bot interactive agent artificial conversation entity or virtual talk chatbotartificial intelligence in the form of naturallanguage processing machine learning and deep learning which we will discuss later makes it possible for chatbots to “learn” by discovering patterns in data without training these chatbots can then apply the pattern to similar problems or slightly different questions this ability gives them the “intelligence” to perform tasks solve problems and manage information without human interventionof course problems can and do arise including instances in which chatbot limitations frustrate customers talk bots also raise some interesting ethical and philosophical questions that researchers have pondered from the start and we’ll cover those laterthe history of chatbots dates to joseph weizenbaums eliza program which was released in 1966 weizenbaum a professor at the massachusetts institute of technology mit named the program after eliza a character in pygmalion a play about a cockney girl who learns to speak and think like an upperclass lady weizenbaum’s computer program convinced many users that they were talking to a human being and not a machine at allby matching patterns and using scripts eliza held “conversations” that gave humans the impression she understood them the bot caused a stir because it was one of the first chatterbots to pass the socalled turing test legendary scientist alan turing proposed the test some 16 years earlier in an article entitled “computing machinery and intelligence” the test evaluates whether a machine can carry on a realtime conversation with a human being without the person being able to detect whether their conversation partner was human or machinethe turing test looks for presence of mind thought and intelligence on the part of a “thinking” machine the loebner prize an ongoing competition recognizes the most humanlike machines using this test eliza proved an interesting point it was able to fool some users into believing that they were talking to a human being because they were quite willing to attribute human intelligence to answers that seemed halfway intelligentin the half century since eliza was released chatbots have come a long way the introduction of machine learning capabilities in bots has vastly improved the humanlike quotient of their conversations most bots though still betray themselves as machines over short interactions there are some exceptions like ai chatbots rose and mitsuku who are tougher to differentiate from real people especially if the user doesn’t know they’re speaking to a botbut bots’ general inability to converse like humans doesn’t really bode ill for them because most bots are deployed in roles where they don’t need to converse like humans to be useful informationgathering bots don’t need to hold long conversations with you to be helpful neither do banking bots customer service bots or bots taking purchase orderslandmarks in the evolution of ai chatbotsname and developeruserolenotes“eliza” created in 1966 at the mit artificial intelligence laboratory by joseph weizenbaumthis program was created to show how communication between humans and machines could never be more than superficialeliza used pattern matching to respond to prompts but couldn’t contextualize and learn through interaction despite this — and much to its creator’s surprise — many of eliza’s users seemed to believe that eliza displayed real intelligence and understanding“parry” implemented in 1972 by kenneth colbyparry simulated a person with paranoid schizophreniain an early version of the turing test experienced psychiatrists were unable to distinguish reliably between actual human patients and parry“julia” developed by michael mauldin in the early 1990sjulia was developed as a companion for textbased roleplaying games such as tinymudjulia participated in the first editions of the loebner prize competition and has existed on the internet in one form or another for nearly 30 years“alice” composed by richard wallace and launched in 1995this bot applied patternmatching heuristics to input received from a human conversation partner in order to engage in

itobviously the older bots on this list don’t really hold a candle to the new entries as far as appearances go try comparing eliza’s clunky old blackandwhite interface with mitsuku’s avatar and sleek text interface but when considering what’s under the hood we have to ask ourselves how “intelligent” the bot is we know that many of eliza’s early users were quite willing to attribute intelligence to the program but what makes a bot “intelligent” todaywhile bot technology has been around for over half a century chatbots’ machine learning capabilities have been progressing by leaps and bounds recently ai chatbots have been a focus of active research and investment by silicon valley which has helped accelerate developmentgiven the advancements in artificial intelligence and the considerable amount of time most customers spend on messaging platforms — where many chatbots are deployed — it’s not an exaggeration to say that ai chatbots are becoming a necessity in some industries talking bots are a good choice for systematic timeconsuming taskstechnology research company gartner has predicted that 85 percent of all customer interactions will be automated by 2020 and consultancy servion believes that artificial intelligence will power 95 percent of all customer interactions by 2025chatbots are surpassing the functionality of interactive voice response systems which simply help users progress through a decision tree of potential options ai chatbots constitute a different kind of conversation agent rather than being confined by a series of possible paths they can generate relevant contextually informed responses to a variety of promptstalking bots are deployed through lots of channels including on websites as an app or part of one and perhaps most significantly on messaging platforms they’re used in applications ranging from digital commerce and banking to research sales and the development of brand awareness they’re a good fit for business functions that have historically involved people performing timeconsuming repetitive tasks such as handling customer services listening to complaints or taking orders and they’re likely to reduce personnel costs while improving efficiency and standardization of functions and servicesgrand view research projects the global chatbot market will reach 125 billion by 2025 with a compound annual growth rate of 243 percent moreover 80 percent of business decisionmaker respondents to a 2016 survey by oracle said they already used chatbots or plan to use them by 2020chatbots are already part of virtual assistants such as siri alexa cortana and google assistant in addition socalled “social bots” promote issues products or candidates people also use ai chatbots for entertainment the hello barbie doll employs a chatbot created by a company named toytalk to talk back to her child owner and chatbots can even do less glamorous things like encouraging people to get their flu shotsat the cutting edge of the chatbot spectrum are bots performing more complex nuanced functions in fields where the human touch remains important such as law legal chatbots can help you file appeals against traffic violations in education talking bots fulfill a number of functions from serving as course assistants to grading essays and eliciting student feedback they act as conversation partners for people seeking companionship and even as talk therapists such as the mental health chatbot woebot the ground rules for relationships between people and machines are still evolving as the 2013 movie her illustratedin marketing the belief that ai and chatbots are the next big thing is widespread many marketers believe artificial intelligence chatbots are revolutionizing business by providing better customer service keeping customers engaged after sales and adding “personality” to a company’s brand ai chatbots can also help companies create more personalized experiences for customers tailoring responses and content to the user’s questions and interests furthermore talk bots are cheap able to work 247 and never lose their tempersthe hype notwithstanding there’s a stark disconnect between those who foresee an ai marketing revolution by 2020 80 percent of marketing executive respondents in a 2016 study by demandbase those who have a very confident understanding of ai 26 percent and those who actually use ai at work 10 percent findings like these have led some experts to believe that ai and talk bots will not transform marketing to the extent advertised most skeptics also feel that ai chatbots will never have a truly human touch and that overenthusiastic use of them can backfire with customersin fact chatbots can even create distrust the security firm distil networks says that about 40 percent of all bot traffic is malicious chat and messaging platforms such as yahoo messenger windows live messenger and aol instant messenger have gained reputations as being populated with bots that at best fill chat rooms with spam and at worst try to entice people to reveal sensitive personal informationchatbotsorg lists more than 1350 chatbots and virtual agents in use around the world many large brands have created fascinating bots that have hit it off with their customers and their target demographicsdisney for example created an officer judy bot on facebook

you book rides and share expected arrival times from within the messenger app capital one has an amazon echo skill that handles balance inquiries pulls up transaction records and enables customers to make payments via voice commandto grasp the potential of chatbots you need to understand how they work and what their capabilities arechatbots come in two main varieties those based on fixed rules and those based on machine learning the former only respond to specified commands and they only display a fixed level of smartness give this kind of bot a command that it doesn’t understand and it won’t know what to do it does not get any smarter with more interactions or informationthe second type of chatbot incorporates artificial intelligence the ability to understand language not just commands and the capacity to learn this technology has led to intelligent chatbots that can discover new patterns and get smarter as they encounter more situationsput simply a chatbot’s job is to receive input data interpret it and translate it into a relevant output value upon receiving the input data it must analyze and contextualize in order to determine the appropriate “reaction” to whatever prompt it has receiveda chatbot’s artificial intelligence has two components machine learning and naturallanguage processing nlpmachine learning is the ability of systems to learn from experience without human intervention and then use what they learnwhile in theory it might be possible to give a machine instructions for how to deal with every language prompt that it could conceivably face it would take forever to write these instructions by the time programmers were done human language might have evolved necessitating new programming a machine programmed this way would understand language perfectly but be impracticalwith machine learning the computer system learns by being exposed to lots of examples rather than by being given more rules this approach is patterned on how the brain learns and is called neural networksmachine learning employs algorithms which in their simplest form are sequences of instructions telling computers what to do algorithms can be combined and sequenced in complex ways when a chatbot receives an input prompt it must analyze the prompt and form context so that it can determine the desired output as the chatbot is trained by having data input it searches for patterns which it can save for reference this is the “learning” processto carry this a step further deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses layered algorithms called an artificial neural network rather than taskspecific algorithms deep learning involves techniques in which the system discovers socalled representations in the data that allow it to make sense of raw data each layer of algorithms in turn comprises interconnected artificial neurons the connections between these neurons are weighted by the prior learning patterns and events the algorithms find patterns in vast quantities of data and infer how to respond to new data from these patterns this approach is used in ai chatbots where a predefined set of responses is not desirable or workablethe chatbot’s algorithms are given a huge quantity of data that they explore for the model or models that enables them to convert to the output that the programmers tell them is correct for example programmers might input different ways to ask a certain question and validate only appropriate answersthe data can thus be thought of as a set of examples that specify the correct outputs for a vast number of given inputs the machine’s job is to extract and store the patterns from the data the chatbot continues to “learn” — that is extract and save patterns — with each subsequent input of datanaturallanguage processing nlp is the other component of a chatbot’s intelligence and refers to its analysis and synthesis of human languages nlp makes use of predictive analytics a combination of statistical data mining and data modeling techniques aimed at proactively generating information without having to wait for a prompt from a humannlp gives a chatbot the ability to learn and mimic the styles and patterns of human conversation it helps create the illusion that the chatbot is another human not a robot there are a number of developers of nlp tools that intelligent chatbots utilize these include ibm watson apiai and witaibut nlp faces challenges such as enabling the chatbot to deduce how the human user is feeling a capability called sentiment analysis that employs language analytics since speech and emotion are fraught with nuance developers have struggled with how to teach chatbots to infer those cues from contexticbenvirdeechapmanjpg “the quality of the training data that allows algorithms to learn is key” notes ben virdeechapman head of product at kairoscom an ai company specializing in face recognition including emotional state“the quality of the training data that allows algorithms to learn is key” notes ben virdeechapman head of product at kairoscom an ai company specializing in face recognition including emotional state“the context in which emotion is being measured has a great impact on the application of the results for example it is now relatively simple to collect emotion data from text audio or visual data applying it in the context of stimuli is where the real challenge lies and written words or spoken words often come from the rational mind…so understanding the differences between rational and irrational responses can help us weight the results” says virdeechapmanwhile many researchers hold out hope for a truly intelligent virtual conversation agent anyone today who has actually talked to a chatbot knows they’re all too fallible many betray their robot identities quite easily as such human supervision of bots remains an integral part of the chatbot ecosystemfor example bots work much better when they perform a small number of recognizable tasks and they make for a better user experience when conversations resemble a set of commands or instructions they can then hand off more sophisticated operations to human supervisors and if bots interact with the public they must be able to deflect or ignore the nonsensical abusive discriminatory or otherwise inappropriate conversations humans seem so tempted to conduct with themwe have discussed in general how machine learning works in chatbots at a more granular level machine learning incorporates a number of different approachessupervised machine learning algorithms these are most like the technique detailed above they involve the use of a training dataset with inputs and outputs for which a machine creates an inferred predictive function that allows it to turn inputs into desired outputs after sufficient training this type of algorithm also enables a machine to learn from mistakes — that is when an input isn’t converted into the desired outputunsupervised machine learning algorithms these are similar but use training data that is not classified or labeled the idea here is not to generate outputs but to describe hidden structures that might be present in unlabeled data so the machine’s goal is to infer a function that can describe these hidden structuresreinforcement machine learning algorithms these use a behaviorreward learning method by which a machine learns which “behaviors” will earn it rewards — including delayed rewards — through trial and error the goal is for a machine to be able to determine the most suitable behavior in a given contextroboticist igor mordatch doubts whether deep neural networks will ever truly succeed in teaching bots to mimic human language he has sought to use reinforcement learning to empower bots to create and learn their own language the bot languages that arise would be translated into human languages the eventual goal real conversation between humans and bots will likely require a combination of techniques mordatch’s work is supported by openai a nonprofit artificial intelligence research firm founded in part by tesla ceo elon musk that is dedicated to developing smart technologies that benefit humanitynaturallanguage processing comprises two related subfields naturallanguage understanding nlu and naturallanguage generation nlgnaturallanguage understanding is the complex nuanced process of taking humanlanguage inputs — with all their variability — and translating them into forms understandable by a machine naturallanguage generation is the reverse process taking the computer’s generated output to a prompt and turning it into a form that is understandable by the human userin the fastmoving world of artificial intelligence chatbots occupy a pretty low rung on the ladder they’re classified as weak ai which means they’re only supposed to learn specific very narrow functions like making reservations or locating books in a library strong ai on the other hand would boast intelligence that equals or surpasses that of human and be capable of a similar diversity of intellectual processesfor example the chatterbot alice artificial linguistic internet computer entity a weak ai entity uses a markup language called aiml artificial intelligence markup language that is designed specifically for use as a conversation agent and has been incorporated into other alicebots yet it boasts no capacity for reasoning and relies solely on its ability to match patternssome chatbots rank slightly higher on the ai strength scale jabberwacky for example learns how to construct responses and parse context based on user interactions instead of relying on an unchanging database other newer chatbots combine the ability to learn with evolutionary algorithms that continually develop their communication abilities nevertheless no chatbot is capable of carrying on the fluid farranging conversations typical of humantohuman interactions and chatbot development usually remains narrowly focusedso what constitutes intelligence within the context of talking botsin layman’s terms a chatbot’s level of intelligence is an umbrella term for its performance in several interconnected areas an intelligent chatbot is typically one that’s capable of “learning” and using its experience to improve its performancebots created for narrower functions are intelligent if they’re able to identify desirable outcomes a challenging task plan a multistep process to achieve these outcomes and then work autonomously to meet them this sequence of activities goes by the name of the “sensethinkact” process in addition bots need to know how to ask questions that will enable them to gather the information required to undertake all the stepsan intelligent chatbot also understands what a user wants and is prepared to meet users’ requests conversation bots are intelligent if they can handle different styles and topics of conversation with ease socalled generative models of chatbots are able to come up with new responses rather than just retrieve from predefined responses generative models can take part in complex longer conversations and deal with multiple questions from the customer as the tasks chatbots perform become more complex raising their iq becomes more difficultgiven the improvements in chatbot technology and how commonly we encounter bots you may now be eager to spot the next virtual conversation agent you talk tohere are a few signs chatbots will often talk and respond at superhuman speeds especially when processing mathematical or simple language inputs like “yes” or “no” a chatbot’s speech output may be unnatural in context they may speak in complete formulaic sentence constructions or conversely be too informal but these characteristics aren’t a sure giveaway what’s more of a tell is their habit of using repetitive outputs like repeatedly telling you they don’t understand what you’re sayingchatbots may also give themselves away by trying a little too hard to sell you things namedropping products and sending you links you didn’t ask for malicious chatbots may also request sensitive information without your indicating that you want to make a purchaseand lastly the vast majority of chatbots will give themselves away if you just keep talking to them ask them what they think about current events or how they feel or simply let a conversation stagnate by using filler words and monosyllabic responses and the limitations of the chatbot will eventually become obvious to youif you’re thinking about deploying chatbots for your business chances are you’re looking at getting started with a conventional bot a message bot’s primary function is exchanging messages with users and the term should not be confused with bots that are built into messaging platforms like facebook messenger where they may have functions besides exchanging messagesmessage bots are the classic chatbot the term message bot is also not synonymous with conversation bot the latter describes a specific type of message bot that is designed primarily to converse with users message bots use messaging interfaces to take on a variety of functions they will likely replace some of the apps on your phone in the near future you won’t need a pizza delivery or ride sharing app if you can just send a message insteadfacebook messenger is the biggest platform for chatbots when messenger was opened for developers to deploy in 2016 30000 bots were created in the first six months and 100000 in the first year chatbots are also featured on wechat and kik where they appear as individual contacts or as participants in group chats nonmessage bots on these platforms do things like play games help you learn send you curated content and

insights firm change sciences suggests starting simply when using chatbots “at best a chatbot can answer a few questions about the weather or schedule a meeting at worst a chatbot can feel like a customer service phone tree for now narrow the focus on supporting a repetitive or dreaded task first” she saysa good place to get started with ai chatbots is by deploying them on social media platforms and messaging apps where potential customers spend time messaging apps have surpassed social networking apps in terms of monthly active users and both the number of sessions and the time spent on social and messaging apps have skyrocketed in the last few years so if you want chatbots to be effective they must engage with your customers where your customers hang outicjonathanduartejpg “when talking with clients i suggest they consider a chatbot as a new employee” says jonathan duarte ceo of chatbot development company gohire “if that employee is going to help answer customer questions they would need to be trained on what the most common questions are and where to find the answers you wouldnt put them on the phone on day one without training same thing with a chatbot you need to put them through product training so they know what the users concerns are” adds duarte“when talking with clients i suggest they consider a chatbot as a new employee” says jonathan duarte ceo

up a facebook messenger bot to showcase your product and have interactive conversations with your customers best part you don’t need an exclusive app for your productsstore — the bot helps you efficiently bypass that longwinded process” makadia notes“in order to get started you can work on identifying certain areas within your business that would benefit the most for example if you happen

notify you when inventory needs restocking chatbots can make it easier for you to offer product suggestions and push personalized deals to customers they’re also capable of accepting payments so the customer engagement can translate into real bottomline gainsduarte of gohire says that customer support and sales are now the primary use cases for chatbots but that traction in hr has been strong too“chatbots can have immediate effects on qualifying sales prospects reducing the cost of having highpaid sales teams who manually respond to nonsales qualified prospects in customer support its a volumeefficiency solution chatbots can scale significantly for level one support issues” duarte points out“in the recruiting and human resources departments chatbots are being used to engage and acquire candidates while also prescreening them for required skills weve seen clients generate 500 percent increases in candidate apply rates using chatbots because of the engaging process compared to job descriptions and webpage application processes” duarte continueschatbots are also a great way to solicit customer feedback which is an expensive timeconsuming process if done manually having a machine collect feedback expedites the analysis of feedback plus it can help build brand image chatbots can help streamline and standardize customer service and improve the helpseeking experience for customers meaning less frustration all aroundchatbots can also be used internally to automate business headaches like coordinating schedules for meetings chatbots stick with the task and because they have a friendly demeanor can elicit responses more quicklybut chatbots — especially the ones designed to be conversational — can wear out their welcome quickly if they don’t display the ability to contextualize or respond in a humanlike fashion we know from eliza that unsuspecting chatbot users are willing to ascribe human intelligence to chatbots who display only a semblance of the same but a bot that is repetitive not satisfyingly responsive or out of date will become a liabilityto avoid these problems make sure information databases that the bot is drawing from are kept updated and use a bot designed with the ability to learn chatbots that can accurately gauge human emotion through nlp and other user behaviors are still largely a work in progress but when they are perfected they’re going to be a big step forward for user engagementwhile chatbots are designed to be humanlike in their interactions actual human beings who know they’re interacting with a machine and not a person don’t usually return the favor especially if they’re using a chatbot anonymously your chatbot is likely to have all sorts of odd prompts thrown at it from the vague to the tangential to the obscene that’s why an effective chatbot needs the ability to steer users gently but firmly in the direction of what it’s meant to accomplishand remember that with customer service bots customers ultimately care about whether they’re getting the service they came for the novelty of talking to a robot no matter how cute it is is no substitute for good service put the customer at the center of your customer service bot strategy by making sure that the bot is actually an improvement on your existing service experience don’t keep people waiting to speak to a bot that turns out to be unhelpfultraditional bot development is a threestage process that includes design build and analytics designing involves defining what the chatbot will look like and how it will interact with users building is creating the brain of the chatbot ie its ability to understand input and generate output analytics monitor how the chatbot performs and offer guidance on improving the way it workschatbot development platforms or chatbot builders simplify the chatbotbuilding process people unfamiliar with coding can create a chatbot using simple draganddrop cloudbased chatbot development platforms such as oracle cloud and ibm watson provide nlp processing and ai capabilities that businesses can leverage other platforms include chatfuel and pandorabots this article on 10 of the most popular tools can help you chooseif you want something more advanced you’ll need to program it and this requires picking a programming language the programming language has nothing to do with the language in which the bot converses with users it’s the language in which the bot’s inner workings are codedplatforms that host chatbots such as facebook telegram and slack support most popular languages including python ph and java but since the choice of language has ramifications for the bot here are a few basic questions you should askwhat language is the developer most comfortable using the obvious answer is to go with whichever language the developer prefers but for new bot programmers python is a good choice it’s versatile and easy to pick upwhat sort of ai capabilities do you want built into the bot python’s a winner here too given that it’s one of the most widely used languages in the field of artificial intelligence natural language toolkit nltk called the “grandfather of nlp integration” was written in python and the language features a wide selection of libraries for machine learning algorithmshow fast do you want the bot to function java and c execute faster than python but you’ll have to ask whether the increased speed is a worthwhile tradeoff for the lesser intelligence you’ll be able to build into the bottony lucas cofounder of converse ai acquired by smartsheet in january 2018 recommends companies deploy chatbots quickly and then refine them based on how they perform “the best piece of advice i give customers is to build quickly and ship a first minimal version to a small group of users and then iterate iterate iterate” he saysictonylucasjpg “there is not enough data today for specific companies and use cases about how their users will interact talk or engage with a bot so the key thing is to use the product development process to help this by shipping early and often and not spending months or years before deploying a first version to receive feedback from customers trust me they will engage with bots in ways that you couldn’t possibly expect both good and bad” lucas emphasizes“there is not enough data today for specific companies and use cases about how their users will interact talk or engage with a bot so the key thing is to use the product development process to help this by shipping early and often and not spending months or years before deploying a first version to receive feedback from customers trust me they will engage with bots in ways that you couldn’t possibly expect both good and bad” lucas emphasizesusing talk bots raises some tricky choices and ethical dilemmas especially as chatbots become harder to distinguish from humansfor example is it ok to create machines that attempt to pass themselves off as human so they can communicate with actual human beings while some bots are straightforward about being machines others are not they’re good enough at hiding their nature to raise questions about how ethical it is to use chatbots without disclosing ithonesty is vital especially when the bot is handling sensitive information contends pavliscak of change sciences “a big ethical concern is transparency do people know they are talking to a chatbot or do they think they are talking to a human some chatbots are a blend of both ethically people have a right to know” she saysdata privacy and what a chatbot does with the information it collects are also hot topics if data gathered by a chatbot is shared internally customers need to know before they start talking to the bot given that users may be tempted into lessthanprofessional communications when they know they’re interacting with bots how many users would be comfortable knowing that transcripts of conversations with chatbots might be read by real peoplechatbots that are malicious by design add a potentially criminal dimension to these agents a chatbot designed to misrepresent its identity gather and use information without consent or hurt the user is obviously unethical and possibly illegal as they learn conversation bots cannot afford to pick up vulgarities and obscenities or offer discriminatory or violent views remember microsoft’s tay which had to be taken offline within 24 hours after it was taught to espouse virulent racismanother chatbot that currently falls into a privacyrelated gray area is woebot a talk therapy chatbot created by stanford university psychologists and ai experts using chat conversations mood tracking videos and word games woebot is designed to help people manage mental health and scientists who examined users’ interactions with woebot found that the bot reduced interpersonal anxiety perhaps since the users weren’t as afraid of being judged by a machine as by another humanwoebot users selfreported reduced depression and anxiety symptoms after a short stint using the bot but privacy activists have been critical of woebot because it works through facebook messenger and facebook owns the content of all conversations with the bot and knows the human user’s real identityother shortcomings hamper chatbots for one they can’t gauge the context of questions with any great degree of accuracy humans are capable of contextualizing conversation almost instantaneously but chatbots can’t be relied upon to “remember” details provided even a few minutes ago their poor grasp of emotional cues also means they don’t know that it’s time to escalate an issue to a human agentsome bots aren’t intelligent at all in that they’re not fully responsive to interactions bots like these are basically dressedup decision trees and trying to find options outside of the tree results in the user quickly hitting a dead endmoreover in certain fields such as education and medicine the spread of chatbots is limited by concerns about the “dehumanization” of interactions many people aren’t comfortable speaking to a bot that can’t evince real empathy or sympathy and in some cultures having to deal with a machine instead of a human being might even be considered insulting even if bots gain greater sentimentreading capacities misgivings are likely to remainthese concerns are magnified as artificial intelligence improves in his 2013 book our final invention artificial intelligence and the end of the human era author james barrat explores the risks of human or superhuman artificial intelligence saying that it would be difficult to controlon a more mundane level researchers are struggling to help bots display the semblance of a personality to improve their conversations which lack a human touchthese issues and others are spurring technologists’ work to perfect ai chatbots they face important milestones in development“the industry is in its very early stages and there is a lot of maturing still to do” says lucas of converse ai “solid use cases and roi will get demonstrated companies will become more comfortable with using chatbots both internally and externally and the technology underpinning bots will also mature making it easier to build more powerful flexible solutions” he insistslucas sees three main prioritiesstorytelling he notes that “chatbots deliberately have a limited but structured interface this makes it easy to build them but means it’s more important to have someone who understands how to tell a brand story or build an interactive dialogue than it is to have a traditional uiux person and it also means there is a risk that bots are built that are genuinely useful but not intuitive or enjoyable to use”suitable use cases lucas says that after a few years of experimentation in 2016 and 2017 in which bots were built with many unhelpful use cases the industry’s focus is on “existing known problems how people work today how they can work better and the future of work this means it’s significantly easier to actually address sensible issues and find value in chat bots”discovery versus spread how do users discover what a chat bot can do and just as importantly what it can’t “narrowly scoped bots with clear capabilities and boundaries are where success is being seen today and i believe that will continue but there is also a need to ensure that users can easily discover new capabilities that are available” lucas contendsso where do chatbots go from heregohire’s duarte says that chatbots will become more accessible to smaller organizations as tools to build and maintain them become less expensivethe user experience and decreasing user frustration are major areas of research for developers they are seeking to combine voice with userfriendly graphical conversation interfaces this pairing would integrate naturallanguage input whether in text or voice format with graphical elements for a seamless and frictionless interaction this advancement will make chatbots more natural to speak to more accessible for the nontechsavvy and perhaps less frustrating to deal withpavliscak anticipates progress on helping chatbots pick up on emotional cues “emotion artificial intelligence that detects physical traces of emotion can help identify when customers are getting stressed eventually that will help chatbots communicate with greater empathy” she sayswhen it comes to efforts to make chatbots seem a little bit more human facebook has been trying to teach chatbots how to make small talk that’s not filled with strange illogical leaps this the experts believe will help make them more personableanother hot area in chatbot development is the enhancement of nlu capabilities this should better allow

what exactly is a smart ai chatbot how to tell if you are talking to a chatbot or a person what a message bot is and how to start using chatbots in your business how to build ai chatbots navigating concerns and ethical problems with ai chatbots the future of artificial intelligence chatbots the future of work with automated processes in smartsheetsupervised machine learning algorithms these are most like the technique detailed above they involve the use of a training dataset with inputs and outputs for which a machine creates an inferred predictive function that allows it to turn inputs into desired outputs after sufficient training this type of algorithm also enables a machine to learn from mistakes — that is when an input isn’t converted into the desired outputunsupervised machine learning algorithms these are similar but use training data that is not classified or labeled the idea here is not to generate outputs but to describe hidden structures that might be present in unlabeled data so the machine’s goal is to infer a function that can describe these hidden structuresreinforcement machine learning algorithms these use a behaviorreward learning method by which a machine learns which “behaviors” will earn it rewards — including delayed rewards — through trial and error the goal is for a machine to be able to determine the most suitable behavior in a given contextalaska airlines’ jenn this bot answers typed questions about flights and the companyrare carat’s rocky this bot answers your questions about diamonds and helps you search for a stone that’s within your budget and in line with your specificationsexpedia’s bot on facebook this app searches for hotel options and guides users to the site to make bookingsmila this internal bot at overstockcom coordinates communications when workers need to take a sick daywhat language is the developer most comfortable using the obvious answer is to go with whichever language the developer prefers but for new bot programmers python is a good choice it’s versatile and easy to pick upwhat sort of ai capabilities do you want built into the bot python’s a winner here too given that it’s one of the most widely used languages in the field of artificial intelligence natural language toolkit nltk called the “grandfather of nlp integration” was written in python and the language features a wide selection of libraries for machine learning algorithmshow fast do you want the bot to function java and c execute faster than python but you’ll have to ask whether the increased speed is a worthwhile tradeoff for the lesser intelligence you’ll be able to build into the botstorytelling he notes that “chatbots deliberately have a limited but structured interface this makes it easy to build them but means it’s more important to have someone who understands how to tell a brand story or build an interactive dialogue than it is to have a traditional uiux person and it also means there is a risk that bots are built that are genuinely useful but not intuitive or enjoyable to use”suitable use cases lucas says that after a few years of experimentation in 2016 and 2017 in which bots were built with many unhelpful use cases the industry’s focus is on “existing known problems how people work today how they can work better and the future of work this means it’s significantly easier to actually address sensible issues and find value in chat bots”discovery versus spread how do users discover what a chat bot can do and just as importantly what it can’t “narrowly scoped bots with clear capabilities and boundaries are where success is being seen today and i believe that will continue but there is also a need to ensure that users can easily discover new capabilities that are available” lucas

picksmost popularwrite with us', 'p': 'the future of ai looks different depending on who you ask some artificial intelligence predictions are more optimistic than otherspowerpresslisten to the audio version of this articleevery day wild tales are told about the implications of artificial intelligence it seems everyone has an opinion and more questions are raised than answered will we be forced one day to swear fealty to our robot overlords is the hype completely overblown or is the truth somewhere in the middle probably after all equivocation is the safest space for amateur prognosticators knowing full well it provides nothing in the way of claritywhile vc dollars flood the ai space and hype consumes the narrative some of sharpest minds on the forefront of science economics and innovation are offering thoughtful consideration of ai and its implications on work and life as we know itlet’s see what they have to say…famed physicist stephen hawking believes that there are two paths that ai could take–one that betters humankind and another that destroys it at leverhulme centre for the future of intelligence lcfi at cambridge university hawking said “the rise of powerful ai will be either the best or the worst thing ever to happen to humanity we do not know which”it isn’t the first time hawking has predicted an end of humanity scenario he’s also pointed out the possibility of a brighter future with ai saying“the potential benefits of creating intelligence are hugewe cannot predict what we might achieve when our own minds are amplified by ai perhaps with the tools of this new technological revolution we will be able to undo some of the damage done to the natural world by the last one – industrialization and surely we will aim to finally eradicate disease and poverty”however he warns that where there is the potential for good there is also the potential for evil in the wrong hands ai technologies could threaten lives and the planetfew tech leaders have been more vocal about ai than elon musk the spacex and tesla ceo has also expressed concern over super ai however he believes that humans will need to evolve to deal with an automated future–or else become irrelevant in one interview he predicted that “there will be fewer and fewer jobs that a robot cannot do better”in order to adjust to this automated future musk suggests a universal basic income he also predicted a cyborglike world where machine and humans merge together“over time i think we will probably see a closer merger of biological intelligence and digital intelligence… some high bandwidth interface to the brain will be something that helps achieve a symbiosis between human and machine intelligence and maybe solves the control problem and the usefulness problem”the facebook founder and ceo has a slightly more optimistic prediction for artificial intelligence although he believes that computers will soon surpass humans when it comes to the basic functions it doesn’t necessarily mean they will be better than us in an earnings call he explained “the basic human senses like seeing hearing language core things that we do i think it’s possible to get to the point in the next five to 10 years where we have computer systems that are better than people at each of those things”in a facebook post he highlighted the realities and benefits of ai saying“artificial intelligence may seem like something out of science fiction but most of us already use tools and services every day that rely on ai…more sophisticated ai systems can already diagnose diseases drive cars and search the skies for planets better than people this is why ai is such an exciting field — it opens up so many new possibilities for enhancing humanity’s capabilities”he also has a different view than other tech leaders and finds fear of ai taking over more on the “hysterical” side in a business insider interview he explained “there are many machines throughout history that were built to do something better than a human can i think this is an area where people overestimate what is possible with ai”amazon founder jeff bezos recently revealed the company’s future plans for ai and some of his own artificial intelligence predictions in a letter to shareholders bezos outlined a threepronged approach for amazon and ai–visible products and moonshots core operations and enterprise cloudhe sees ai as more of a behindthescenes helper for now writing“much of what we do with machine learning happens beneath the surface machine learning drives our algorithms for demand forecasting product search ranking product and deals recommendations merchandising placements fraud detection translations and much more though less visible much of the impact of machine learning will be of this type — quietly but meaningfully improving core operations”the microsoft founder shares similar concerns on ai as musk and hawking“first the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent that should be positive if we manage it well a few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern”he recently called for a tax on companies that replace humans with robots saying “if a robot comes in to do the same thing you’d think that we’d tax the robot at a similar level” it also may alter the image of robots taking over jobs he explained “it is really bad if people overall have more fear about what innovation is going to do than they have enthusiasm”gates may believe that we should proceed with caution when it comes to ai but that doesn’t mean he isn’t excited while speaking at columbia university he said that if he were to drop out of college today it would be to pursue a career in artificial intelligenceinterestingly microsoft is one of the companies leading in the development of ai technologies they leverage workstreams to shape the data sets and algorithms used in some of their ai initiatives the current ceo satya nadella has called ai the “ultimate breakthrough” in technology but clarified that “we should not claim that artificial general intelligence is just around the corner”most artificial intelligence predictions see ai as a tool that has huge potential to be used for good but also has potential for less desirable outcomes like rampant joblessness an eroding tax base or…the end of humanity like any tool it is ultimately the people wielding it that will decide it’s fate how leaders predict ai will transform the future may differ slightly from person to person however there are three main themes that everyone seems to agree onfortunately many companies at the forefront of ai are taking steps to shape a more ethical future last year amazon deepmindgoogle facebook ibm and microsoft announced a partnership on artificial intelligence to benefit people and society partnership on aihawking and musk endorsed the asilomar ai principles a set of 23 principles that are designed to ensure that ai technologies are created and used to better the worldi have an optimistic view of the role of technology writ large for humanity we amplify our own human potential

of an abundance of caution because of the perceived safety welfare and market risks these new innovations might seem to posemany people’s understanding of artificial intelligence technologies is unfortunately largely informed by dystopian science fiction movies television and books if one’s sole conception of a technology comes from hollywood depictions of killer robotic systems it is important to remember that these representations are fictionalconcerns have been growing about the “rise of the robots” and the impact of automation and ai adoption on the presentday workforce these fears are older than many may realize a life magazine cover from july 1963 grimly discusses the point of no return with the rise of automation technological progress has only accelerated since then

technology or ai has developed rapidly during the past decade and the effects of the ai revolution are already being keenly felt in many sectors of the economy a growing chorus of commentators scientists and entrepreneurs has expressed alarm regarding the increasing role that autonomous machines are playing in society with some suggesting that government regulation may be necessary to reduce the public risks that ai will pose unfortunately the unique features of ai and the manner in which ai can be developed present both practical and conceptual challenges for the legal system these challenges must be confronted if the legal system is to positively impact the development of ai and ensure that aggrieved parties receive compensation when ai systems cause harm this article will explore the public risks associated with ai and the competencies of government institutions in managing those risks it concludes with a proposal for an indirect form of ai regulation based on

media over the past year or so you might get the impression that it’s only a matter of time before the threat of artificial intelligence comes to destroy us alleditor’s note this is a departure from our normal howto and explanatory format where we let our writers research and present a thoughtprovoking look at technologyfrom big summer blockbusters like avengers age of ultron and johnny depp’s stinkfest transcendence to smaller indie flicks like exmachina or channel 4’s hit drama humans screenwriters seemingly can’t get enough of the trope that no matter what form ai eventually takes in the next few decades you can bet it’ll be hell bent on teaching humanity a lesson about falling victim to its own hubrisbut is any of this fear of the machines justified in this feature we’re going to examine the world of ai from the perspective of scientists engineers programmers and entrepreneurs working in the field today and boil down what they believe could be the next great revolution in human and computer intelligenceso should you start stockpiling bullets for the coming war with skynet or kick up your feet while an army of subservient drones take care of your every whim read on to find outto begin it helps to know what exactly we’re talking about when we use the blanket term “ai” the word has been thrown around and redefined a hundred times since the concept of selfaware computers was first proposed by the unofficial father of ai john mccarthy in 1955… but what does it really meanwell first of all readers should know that artificial intelligence as we understand it today actually falls into two separate categories “ani” and “agi”the first short for artificial narrow intelligence encompasses what is generally referred to as “weak” ai or an ai that can only operate in one constrained area of specialization think deep blue the supercomputer that was designed by ibm to trounce the world’s chessmasters back in 1997 deep blue can do one thing really really well beat humans at chess… but that’s about ityou may not realize it but we’re already surrounded by ani in our everyday lives machines that track your shopping habits on amazon and generate recommendations based on thousands of different variables are built on rudimentary anis that “learn” what you like over time and choose similar products accordingly another example could be personal email spam filters systems that sort through millions of messages at once to decide which are real and what’s extra noise that can be shoved off to the siderelated why is email spam still a problemani is the helpful relatively innocuous implementation of machine intelligence that all of humanity can benefit from because although it’s capable of processing billions of numbers and requests at a time it still operates within a constrained environment that’s limited by the number of transistors we allow it to have at any given time on the other hand the ai we’ve been growing increasingly wary of is something called “artificial general intelligence” or agias it stands currently creating anything that can be even remotely referred to as agi remains the holy grail of computer science and – if achieved – could fundamentally alter everything about the world as we know it there are many various hurdles to surmounting the challenge of creating a true agi on par with the human mind not least of which is that although there are a lot of similarities between the way our brains work and how computers process information when it comes down to actually interpreting things the way we do machines have a bad habit of getting hung up on the details and missing the forest for the treeswhen ibm’s watson computer famously learned how to curse after reading through the urban dictionary we gained an understanding of just how far off we are from an ai that’s genuinely capable of sorting through the minutia of the human experience and creating an accurate picture of what a “thought” is supposed to be made ofsee during the development of watson engineers were having trouble trying to teach it a natural pattern of speech that more closely emulated our own rather than that of a raw machine speaking in perfect sentences to fix this they figured it would be a good idea to run the entirety of the urban dictionary through its memory banks promptly after which watson responded to one of the team’s tests by calling it “bullsht”the conundrum here is that even though watson knew it was cursing and that what it was saying was offensive it didn’t fully understand why it wasn’t supposed to use that word which is the critical component that separates the standard ani of today from evolving into the agi of tomorrow sure these machines can read facts write sentences and even simulate the neural network of a rat but when it comes to critical thinking and judgement skills the ai of today still lags woefully behind the curverelated ibm’s jeopardy playing computer watson shows the pros how it’s done videothat gap between knowing and understanding is nothing to sneeze at and it’s the one which pessimists point to when arguing that we’re still a long ways off from creating an agi capable of knowing itself the way we do it’s a massive gulf one that neither computer engineers or human psychologists could claim they have a grip on in the modern definition of what makes a conscious being well consciousbut even if we do somehow manage to create an agi in the next decade which is pretty optimistic given current projections it should all be gravy from there on out right humans living with ai ai hanging out with humans on the weekends after a long day at the numbercrunching factory pack up and we’re done herehope we’re not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence unfortunately that is increasingly probable— elon musk elonmusk august 3 2014well not quite there’s still one more category of ai left and it’s the one that all the movies and tv shows have been trying to warn us about for years asi otherwise known as “artificial super intelligence” in theory an asi would be born out of an agi getting restless with its lot in life and making the premeditated decision to do something about it on its own without our permission first the concern many researchers in the field have proposed is that once an agi achieves sentience it won’t be content with what it’s got and will do whatever it can to increase its own capabilities by any means necessarya possible timeline goes as follows humans create machine machine becomes as smart as humans machine which is now as smart as the humans which created a machine as smart as themselves stick with me here learns the art of selfreplication selfevolution and selfimprovement it doesn’t get tired it doesn’t get sick and it can grow endlessly while the rest of us are recharging our batteries in bedthe fear is that it would be a matter of just a few nanoseconds before an agi easily surpassed the intelligence of all humans living today and if connected to the web would only need to be one simulated neuron smarter than the world’s smartest hacker to take control of every internetconnected system on the planetonce it gains control it could then have the potential to use its power to slowly start amassing an army of machines that are equally as intelligent as its creator and able to evolve at an exponential rate as more and more nodes are added to the network from here all models drawn on the curve of machine intelligence promptly rocket through the roofthat said however they’re primarily still based on speculation rather than anything tangible this leaves a lot of room for assumption on behalf of dozens of different experts on both sides of the issue and even after years of heated debate there’s still no common consensus on whether or not an asi will be a merciful god or see humans as the carbonburning foodgorging species that we are and wipe us from the history books like we scrub a trail of ants off the kitchen counterso now that we understand what ai is the different forms it may take over time and how those systems could become a part of our lives in the near future the question remains should we be afraidhot on the trail of the public’s piqued interest in ai over the past year many of the world’s top scientists engineers and entrepreneurs have jumped at the opportunity to give their two cents on what artificial intelligence might actually look like outside of hollywood’s sound stages in the next few decadeson the one hand you have the gloomanddoomers like elon musk stephen hawking and bill gates all of whom share the concern that without the proper safeguards put in place it will only be a matter of time before an asi dreams up a way to wipe out the human race“one can imagine such technology outsmarting financial markets outinventing human researchers outmanipulating human leaders and developing weapons we cannot even understand” wrote hawking in an open letter to the ai community this year“whereas the shortterm impact of ai depends on who controls it the longterm impact depends on whether it can be controlled at all”on the other we find a brighter portrait painted by futurists like ray kurzweill microsoft’s chief researcher eric horovitz and everybody’s other favorite apple founder steve wozniak both hawking and musk are considered to be two of the greatest minds of our generation so to question their predictions on the damage the technology might cause in the long term is no easy feat but leave it to luminaries like wozniak to step in where others would only darewhen asked how he believes an asi might treat humans the woz was blunt in his shaded optimism “will we be the gods will we be the family pets or will we be ants that get stepped on i don’t know about that” he queried in an interview with the australian financial review “but when i got that thinking in my head about if i’m going to be treated in the future as a pet to these smart machines… well i’m going to treat my own pet dog really nice”and it’s here we find the philosophical dilemma that no one is fully comfortable coming to a consensus on will an asi see us as an innocuous housepet to be coddled and cared for or an unwelcome pest deserving of a quick and painless exterminationthough it would be a fool’s errand to claim to know exactly what’s going on in the head of the real life tony stark i think when musk and friends warn us about the danger of ai they aren’t referring to anything that resembles the terminator ultron or avaeven with immense amounts of innovation at our fingertips the robots we have today can barely walk a mile an hour before they reach an impassable barrier get confused and eat pavement in hilarious fashion and while one might try point to moore’s law as an example for how quickly robotics technology has the potential to progress in the future the other only needs to look at the asimo which first debuted nearly 15 years ago and hasn’t made any significant improvements sinceas much as we might want them to robotics haven’t come anywhere close to adhering to the same model of exponential progress as we’ve seen in computer processor developments they are constrained by the physical limits of how much power we can fit into a battery pack the faulty nature of hydraulic mechanisms and the endless struggle to master the fight against their own center of gravityso for the time being no even though a true agi or asi could potentially be created in a static supercomputer on some server farm in arizona it still remains highly unlikely that we’ll find ourselves sprinting through the streets of manhattan as a horde of metal skeletons mow us down from behindrelated how artificial intelligence will change our lives for better or worseinstead the ai that elon and hawking are so keen to caution the world against is that of the “careerreplacing” variety one that can think faster than us organize data with fewer mistakes and even learn how to do our jobs better than we could ever hope to – all without asking for health insurance or a few days off to take the kids down to disneyland on spring breaka few months ago npr released a handy tool on its website wherein podcast listeners could select from a list of different careers to find out the percentage of risk their specific line of work carried for being automated at some point in the next 30 yearsfor a wide range of jobs including but not limited to clerical positions nursing it diagnostics and even cafe baristas robots and their ani counterparts will almost certainly put millions of us out of work and into the bread line sooner than many of us think but these are machines that will be programmed to do one task and one task only and have little if any ability to move beyond a specialized series of preprogrammed instructions that we carefully install beforehandthis means that at least in the foreseeable future think 1025 years anis will be the real tangible threat to our way of life far more than any theoretical agi or asi might we already know that automation is a growing problem that will drastically alter the way income and privilege are distributed throughout the first and third world however whether those robots will eventually attempt to trade in their sewing machines for machine guns is still the subject of a heated and as you’ll find out ultimately frivolous debate“you know i know this steak doesn’t exist i know that when i put it in my mouth the matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious after nine years you know what i realize”“ignorance is bliss” – cypherthough this is still a matter of fiercely argued opinion for now the consensus of many top scientists and engineers in the field of ai research looks to be that we’re at far greater risk for falling prey to the comforts that a world of artificial intelligence could provide rather than being shot down by a reallife version of skynet as such it’s a concerning possibility that our eventual demise might not come as the product of slow methodical progress into the great unknown instead it’s much more likely to surface as an unintended consequence of the rushed overlyenthusiastic intersection of our own hubris and ingenuity slamming together to create the next great technological singularitythink less terminator and more walle like the fleet of robots who fattened up the humans in pixar’s film we humans have no problem keeping chimps in a zoo and the distinction is whether an ai will be kind enough to do the same with usfrom this perspective it makes more sense to be afraid of a reality where humans are hooked up to a persistent planetwide vr simulation à la the matrix fattened to the gills by their favorite foods and given everything they could ever want while the machines take care of the rest a place where an evolved asi doesn’t see us as a bug to scrape off its shoe but instead as the adorable monkey meatbags we are easy to please and deserving of at least a little bit of credit for creating the allknowing allseeing quasigod that eventually took over the planetrelated automate tasks on your android device with automagicin this respect it all comes down to your definition of what it means to “live” through the ai revolution the idea that something ‘useless’ has to be done away with is an exclusively human concept a mindset that we shouldn’t immediately expect our machine overlords to adopt from our limited moral scope perhaps the eventual evolution of our digital intelligence won’t be pure evil but an infinite biasless compassion for all living things no matter how selfish selfrighteous or selfdestructive they may beit depends on who you askif you poll two of the smartest technological engineers and mathematicians in the modern world you’d get four different answers and the numbers don’t sway from dead even the more people you add to the scoreboard either way the core issue we should be addressing isn’t about “is ai coming” because it is and none of us are going to be able to stop it looking over so many different perspectives the real question that no one is comfortable answering with too much gumption is “will it be merciful”even after some of the world’s greatest minds have weighed in on the issue the picture of what machine intelligence might look like 20 30 or 50 years into the future still comes out pretty murky because the field of ai is constantly transforming into something else every time a new computer chip is manufactured or transistor material is developed claiming ultimate authority on what may or may not happen is a bit like saying you “know” that a dice roll is certain to come up snake eyes on the next throwone thing we can report with confidence is that if you’re worried about getting a pink slip next week from your computerized cash register try not to get too caught up about it taco bell will still be open for taco tuesdays and a human will most definitely be taking your order at the window and forgetting the green sauce again according to a study conducted by james barrat at last year’s agi summit in quebec the jury on a hard timeline for ai is still out less than half of all those in attendance said they believed we would achieve a true agi before the year 2025 while over 60 percent said it would take until at least 2050 if not next into the next century and beyondputting a hard date on our date with digital destiny is a bit like saying you know it’s going to rain on today’s date 34 years from now the gap between a true agi and an advanced artificial super intelligence is so slim that things will either go really right or horribly wrong very very quickly and although quantum computers are just over the horizon and we’ve all got networked smartphones in our pockets that can beam signals into space we are still just barely scratching the surface of understanding the “why” of why we think about things the way we do or where consciousness even comes from in the first placeto imagine we could accidentally create an artificial mind rife with all our own faults and evolutionary misfires – before we even know what it is that makes us who we are – is the essence of the human ego run amokin the end despite our unrelenting desire to decide who will come out on top in the coming war andor peace treaty between mankind and machines it’s a contest of limited expectations vs limitless possibilities and all we’re doing is arguing semantics in between sure if you’re fresh out of high school and looking to get your taxi driving certification the ceo of uber has half a million reasons why you should probably think about finding a career somewhere elsebut if you’re stockpiling weapons and canned beans for the ai apocalypse you might be better off spending your time learning how to paint code or write the next great american novel even at the most conservative estimates it will be a number of decades before any machine learns how to be monet or teaches itself c and java because humans are filled with the kind of creativity ingenuity and ability to express our innermost selves like no automated coffee maker ever couldyes we might get a little emotional sometimes come down with a cold on the job or need to take a power nap in the middle of the day but maybe it’s precisely because we’re human that the threat of creating something greater than us inside a machine is still a long long way awayimage credits disney pixar paramount

battlefield technicians or platoon commanders yet but ai research and development is continually advancing and although it may seem to be moving at a snails pace computer technology in general is accelerating in a pattern known as moores law and may provide the computational capacity required for truly intelligent programs within a mere decade or twothere are many who believe that creating an intelligent machine is impossible thats what they used to say about men flying and after the wright brothers learned how to fly people said it about putting men in space and now theres a flag on the moon courtesy of neil armstrong and we have the international space station in orbit around the earth so now people are saying it about intelligent computers that they are impossible but history has shown that just because something cant currently be done this doesnt mean it wont be done in the futurecomputers can now do many things that before only humans could do play chess recognize letters of the alphabet check spelling check grammar recognize faces take dictation speak win game shows and many more but the naysayers persist its odd that once a human ability is successfully automated the general public no longer considers it to be an example of ai or ai research — this phenomenon is known as the ai effect at that point they say its just another program computers will never be able to actually reasonhow many mental abilities does it take to make a machine intelligent nobody knows but at the rate which new abilities are being added to computers repertoires it may not be very long ai researchers see intelligent machines on the horizon even though the general public does notsony has created a robot named asimo that gives tours of sonys headquarters in japan it looks you in the eye when its shaking your hand and it walks even up and down stairs nasa has developed an anthropomorphic robotic hand as a component of its robonaut including the software to enable it to do many of the things a human can do with his or her hands other companies or organizations are working on other body parts such as robotic legs and feet and visual systems while others endeavor to reverse engineer the subsystems of the human brain like the hypothalamus which controls memoryartificial intelligence ai is a young field with massive potential for growth this article encourages the reader to consider what philosophical and cultural impacts this growth could have upon our societyartificial intelligence has already had a significant impact on our world enabling developments that were unimaginable only a century ago “intelligent” telephone networks route calls more efficiently than any human operator cars are constructed in largely unmanned factories by automated robots artificial intelligence is even being integrated into common household items such as the humble vacuumcleanerartificial intelligence has replaced human workers in a number of fields that involve relatively simple and repetitive tasks computers possess many advantages over human workers they are consistent they don’t tire and they never demand a pay rise or a salary for that matter however the computer revolution has resulted in the creation of jobs in a number of new fields such as software engineering and cpu designalthough artificial intelligence is currently too simple to compete with human beings in these more cerebral jobs this will likely change as the field advances if moore’s law continues to hold we can expect the complexity of computers to rival that of the human brain by the year 2020 furthermore some computer scientists predict that in much the same way that computer aided design cad facilitated the creation of more powerful computers the ai field will accelerate as ai becomes increasingly able to assist in its own developmentthese are questions that the human race may well face some day and the foundations are being laid today most of them relate to one overarching theme with artificial intelligence in it what would the world be like', 'ul': '1 ai what it means today 2 ai our future 3 questions 4 additional readingcould ai be developed to create artificial art what impact would this have how would the economy adjust if computers and robots supplanted humans in a majority of jobs if human labor were rendered obsolete what would civilization be like is there a difference between ‘having simulated intelligence’ and being intelligent if so what is it a selfreplicating technology could have effects reaching far beyond the act of creating the first one if humans become capable of making machines as intelligent as humans then it follows that such computers or robots could make more of themselves should measures be put in place to prevent or limit the development of such selfreplicating technologies given the nature of competition and political conflict between nations is this even possible world wide given the nature of the availability of computer knowhow to the general public is this possible at all would an artificially intelligent entity capable of replicating itself qualify as a life form strong ai is hypothetical artificial intelligence that is as smart as a human assuming that strong ai would be recursive that is capable of improving its own design what effect would that have on human civilization could ais have emotion would they should they would ais based on human brain anatomy be subject to mood shifts neuroses or pms could an ai go insane could an ai become evil could this be prevented could it be stopped if it occurred what role would ais serve in human government is it possible to control strong ai or would it become selfdirecting if so how if an ai became selfaware and sued for rights what would happen what should happen if you woke up one day to discover that you were a copy of yourself uploaded into a robotic body and you were owned by a corporation what would you do if an intelligence were inherently designed to be satisfied with subservience would that be slavery to what extent could ai be constrained to humanlike thinking assuming it could should it be could ais take over how if ais acquired the ability to communicate via text via interrelay chat email web content etc how would you be able to tell their text from text entered by a human based on how integrated computers and computer programs are in society today especially within our communications systems if ais did take over would we even notice it at the time how if ais took over what would happen to humans would we

for bioethics in conjunction with nyu center for mind brain and consciousness will host a conference on “the ethics of artificial intelligence”recent progress in artificial intelligence ai makes questions about the ethics of ai more pressing than ever existing ai systems already raise numerous ethical issues for example machine classification systems raise questions about privacy and bias ai systems in the nearterm future raise many more issues for example autonomous vehicles and autonomous weapons raise questions about safety and moral responsibility ai systems in the longterm future raise more issues in turn for example humanlevel artificial general intelligence systems raise questions about the moral status of the systems themselvesthis conference will explore these questions about the ethics of artificial intelligence and a number of other questions includingwhat ethical principles should ai researchers follow are there restrictions on the ethical use of ai what is the best way to design morally beneficial ai is it possible or desirable to build moral principles into ai systems when ai systems cause benefits or harm who is morally responsible are ai systems themselves potential objects of moral concern what moral framework is best used to assess questions about the ethics of aispeakers and panelists will includepeter asaro the new school media studies

involve number crunching at their core but while bi is primarily retrospective in nature ai is all about the future the statistical analysis behind bi is primarily about basic counts in contrast with the ultrasophisticated machine learning and deep learning algorithms that underpin aibecause of these differences and the fact that ai as a useful tool is relatively new while bi is yesterdays news we treat the two disciplines as wholly separate during my time at the oreilly ai conference in new york in late june i heard not a single mention of bi conversely at dresner advisory services llcs real business intelligence conference held on the campus of mit in july ai was primarily used as a counterpoint to bi in discussions of the latters strong business value and high adoptionbut speaker mico yuk ceo of consultancy bi brainz in atlanta had an interesting idea im hoping that with more machine learning key performance indicators will grow and evolve she said im hoping we can work on metrics using data science and make kpis work for you rather than you working for themin her vision machine learning algorithms deployed in bi software will tell businesses whats interesting in their historical data right now analysts typically have to define metrics for bi tools to track its a manual process and it only makes visible data the company already knows is importantbut machine learningenabled bi could delve deeper into a business unknown unknowns finding insights in previously unexamined data taken a step further aipowered bi could take advantage of natural language generation capabilities to explain to the business what these insights mean and how they might act on themthis isnt exactly a revolutionary idea bi vendor sisense announced in april a data discovery component to its software that automatically reviews data and alerts users to new and potentially interesting features other vendors are also adding machine learning components to their software analyst firm gartner has been talking about smart data discovery since at least 2015 but it wasnt until this springs magic quadrant report on bi and analytics platforms that gartner declared smart data discovery the next disruptor in the bi software marketthere is some momentum around the idea of combining machine learning business intelligence and artificial intelligence but based on my reporting the idea seems to have seeped little into the general publics consciousness we still mostly see ai and bi as separate domainsthis has to change think of all the time aipowered bi platforms could free up for analysts who currently spend much of their time handling requests for reports they could move on to more effective data science and predictive analytics projects weve seen from companies like uber and google that smart approaches to machine learning can create entirely new profitable business models thats the kind of thing people with strong analytics skills should be spending their time onmaybe once the hype surrounding ai starts to wear off the differences between it and bi will seem smaller and the opportunity more obvious after all were already seeing ai having a big impact on crm hr and fintech software theres no reason bi shouldnt be nexttools we call ai today rarely live up to their hypesharp developers needed for building strong ai toolswhy ai might be

most pressing threat related to ai in other words might be neither artificial nor intelligent and the most urgent task for the ai community then is addressing the branding challenge not the

sap3 april 2017 3 minwhat exactly is artificial intelligence and what is the difference between general intelligence and super intelligence can we expect benevolent robots to be walking amongst us in the near future40 years ago today science fiction’s most iconic film was released star wars gave us two of our most beloved onscreen robots though r2d2 and c3po were far more advanced than anything existing then and even now artificial intelligence was already well on its way when the film premiered in fact the father of ai had already designed a test to determine a machine’s intelligence back in 1950 the turing test created by mathematician and computer scientist alan turing asked a judge to field a series of questions to two participants one machine and one human based on the responses the judge would then determine the human responder the computer was deemed intelligent if it was able to fool the judge at least 50 percent of the timesimply put artificial intelligence refers to a machine’s ability to imitate human cognitive abilities like problem solving and learning these skills also require an understanding of language and speech and strategic thinking we already encounter numerous applications of artificial intelligence on a daily basis when we ask siri for directions when driving past google’s autonomous vehicles when we use selfparking or cruise control featureshowever inspired by film and literature many people are more familiar with the concept of artificial general intelligence agi computers would be equally intelligent to humans in every aspect these machines would be capable of performing the same kind of intellectual tasks that humans perform with the same level of success apple’s cofounder steve wozniak developed the coffee test as an indicator for agi during the test a robot has to enter an average home and attempt to make coffee this means finding all the tools figuring out how they operate and then performing the task a robot able to complete this test would be considered an example of agi think c3pobut what about hal 9000 the 2001 a space odyssey horror computer is also still currently the stuff of fiction this field of ai is called artificial superintelligence and it is also the field of research that stephen hawking has warned us about one of ai’s leading figures nick bostrom has defined superintelligence as “an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field including scientific creativity general wisdom and social skills” this slight or vast superiority to human intellect is disconcerting to scientists and laymen because its outcome is unknown a machine capable of constantly learning and improving itself could be unstoppablewhere exactly is ai headed some of the most exciting advancements in ai are a result of selflearning and analytics for examplea study published by nature outlined the work of a team of researchers on “simulated childhood” this is a robot’s ability to detect a malfunction and use a process of trial and error to determine the defect and repair it in a matter of minutes the robots tested could identify a problem and determine the best ways to fix itself the robots could repair 14 forms of damagein 2013 a computer had the intelligence level of a 4year old child in 2014 a computer was able to solve a mathematical problem so complex that the most intelligent human minds could not check for accuracy computer scientist and futurist ray kurzweil said that computer intelligence would reach human levels by 2029by analyzing data from over 100 million articles sgi altix supercomputer nautilus was able to predict the future the computer could assess tone and mood connect it to geographical locations and use that information to foresee internet entrepreneur kalev leetaru who fed the computer all the information considers it akin to weather forecasting “its never perfect but we can do better than random guessing”it is clear that ai has resulted in machines that are in many ways more capable than human minds however it will be a long time before they are able to surpass human intelligence in every regard and should this day come the brightest minds in the field are well aware of the risks of superintelligent computers and should be able to thwart any hal 9000’s before it’s too latefind out how

entrance exams artificial intelligence or ai is the practice of making a machine behave in a practical responsive way its already changing our world and is by my reckoning the most fascinating field of technology right nowbut as one professor i spoke to for this story put it the audacity of the attempt to build an intelligent machine comes with a responsibility to know what were meddling with for everyone who ever thumbed through a copy of i robot mouth agape heres what you need to know about ai in the modern worldmention the phrase killer robot in conversation and youll almost certainly raise a smile your peers doubtless imagining a glowing blue humanoid cyborg sadly pondering what is love before its eyes turn red and it selfdestructs obliterating the northern hemisphereclick here for more stories in cnets most exciting tech seriesdeeply ingrained in modern pop culture is the notion that some manner of ai uprising is on the cards james camerons iconic image of a terminator stamping on a mound of human skulls is never far from any geeks thoughtsthat playful cinematic and deeply poetic cultural artifact belies the very real threat humanity faces however not from killer robots overthrowing their human masters but from intelligent robots following ordersthe immediate threat experts warn comes in the form of autonomous weapons military machines capable of killing without permission from a human from unmanned planes to missile defence systems to sentry robots weve already got military hardware that functions with very little input from a human mindgroups such as the campaign to stop killer robots say were inching ever closer to closing the loop and letting machines handle our killing for us a scenario thats legally pragmatically and of course ethically problematicthe less sensationally named future of life institute recently published an open letter signed by hundreds of ai researchers and famous tech personalities warning if any major military power pushes ahead with ai weapon development a global arms race is virtually inevitable and the endpoint of this technological trajectory is obvious autonomous weapons will become the kalashnikovs of tomorrowthe campaign to stop killer robots a coalition of more than 50 nongovernmental organisations claims its making progress towards a treaty one akin to the international agreement outlawing chemical weapons the un has already hosted discussions on the subject of autonomous murderbots one huge obstacle facing these groups however is that to rave about imminent robot slaughter makes you look like a crackpot whos watched the matrix one too many timeshumanity needs to revise its popcultureinstilled notion that robots becoming selfaware and robots wiping out humanity will occur simultaneously machines that become smart enough to ponder their own existence may certainly be a problem decades down the line but phenomenal advances in ai mean that robots that kill without even being programmed to understand the barest concept of mercy are uncomfortably closeartificial intelligence takes many forms and while weve successfully programmed machines to clean our floors set alarms on our phones park our cars and take out military installations from above the clouds things like introspection and selfawareness are proving a little toughertelling a joke making an ethical judgement deciding that you want to collaborate with some individuals and not others this rich texture of human life isnt there in our machines at all said sir nigel shadbolt professor of computer science at oxford universityfor decades humans have looked forward to the socalled singularity the moment of selfawareness that creates an explosion in selfimproving machine intelligence this will be triggered its presumed by the exponential growth of computing power coupled with advancing software complexityfuturist ray kurzweil predicted in a 2005 book that a model of human intelligence would be achieved as soon as the mid 2020s what appears to be the case now however is that the complexity of our own minds the key that gives rise to consciousness is a lot more well complicated than we imaginedthat spark of awareness in your head we dont know where that comes from shadbolt said the complexity we embody that allows consciousness to happen isnt just by the fact that weve got this kind of cortex this rational brain we have an endocrine system were emotional we have the threelayer brainwe are extraordinarily complex and we have only begun to unpack just a tiny amount of that at this pointits still the hard problem shadbolt said later joking when i ask what the biggest public misconception is concerning ai that its just 10 years down the roadthat sentiment is shared by murray shanahan professor of cognitive robotics at imperial college london who told me the media often gives the impression that humanlevel ai of the sort we see in scifi movies is just around the corner but its almost certainly decades awaytwo of the major problems shanahan explained are endowing computers and robots with a common sense understanding of the everyday world and endowing them with creativity by creativity i dont mean the sort of thing we see in the picassos or einsteins of the world but rather the sort of thing that every child is capable offrom the terminator series to movies such as i robot chappie ex machina and even short circuit the way we portray ai on screen has traditionally been humancentric we tend to imagine a being that essentially looks and acts a lot like a person as ai spreads into every aspect of our life we should be prepared to broaden our horizons when it comes to imagining the bounds and types of intelligence that can be valuable after all weve got plenty of humangrade intelligence alreadythe point cant be just to replicate ourselves shadbolt said weve got very interesting biological ways of doing that so why on earth would we want to do it in siliconfrom the humble roomba to googles animallike selfdriving car siri or neural networks that oversee data centres ai is branching out in ways we couldnt have imagined decades ago if you define intelligence in a way thats more machinecentric professor alan woodward told me last year in an interview on the fading relevance of the turing test youll find some very intelligent machines out there alreadythat diversity in the kinds of ai now emerging may in part come down to the breadth of disciplines currently investigating machine intelligence theres a broad range of subjects now that look at the problem shadbolt said psychologists look at it from a human context there are animal psychologists physiologists neuroscientists ai practitioners all looking at it with a different anglefundamentally well need an interdisciplinary approach so for me there isnt one single discipline that will have all the answersthats the face of modern ai taskcentric wildly diverse intelligent systems essentially mindless for now but busily changing every aspect of human life nonetheless whether its public transport or patrolling the skies the ai of today is nothing like the gloomy glowing

input relevant datathe ai application could recognize individuals as they enter a meeting room prompting the meeting system to say hi julie i see you have a 400 pm status meeting would you like me to start it this saves time starting audio video and web conferencing bridges as well as retrieving digital whiteboards and shared files it could take attendance by visually or audibly recognizing employees as they join meetings and the ai could use data analytics to help facilities and uc managers gain insight into how meeting spaces are being used how many people are in a typical meeting and how long they use the roomcompliance and security it leaders especially those in regulated industries are likely to be wary about ais access to corporate information and the way that information is stored within ai engines as ai platforms become targets for attack expect to pay closer attention to how that data is protected reliance on cloud the computing power required for ai as well as the need for rapid application evolution typically means that ai platforms are cloudbased and use microservicesbased architectures that leads to data security issues as well the need to ensure that data is stored in accordance with standards like the general data protection regulation business case many of the previously described scenarios are difficult to quantify for enterprises trying to determine return on investment vendors likely will integrate aidriven applications into their current offerings rather than sell separate tools requiring their own licenses or software acquisitions still enterprises will incur costs related to training and it support that they will need to balance with measurable productivity gains and process improvements it leaders will want to ensure that
