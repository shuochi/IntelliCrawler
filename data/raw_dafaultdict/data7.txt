ethics of ai more pressing than ever existing ai systems already raise numerous ethical issues for example machine classification systems raise questions about privacy and bias ai systems in the nearterm future raise many more issues for example autonomous vehicles and autonomous weapons raise questions about safety and moral responsibility ai systems in the longterm future raise more issues in turn for example humanlevel artificial general intelligence systems raise questions about the moral status of the systems themselvesthis conference will explore these questions about the ethics of artificial intelligence and a number of other questions includingwhat ethical principles should ai researchers follow are there restrictions on the ethical use of ai what is the best way to design ai that aligns with human values is it possible or desirable to build moral principles into ai systems when ai systems cause benefits or harm who is morally responsible are ai systems themselves

the hottest buzzword in tech and with good reason after decades of research and development the last few years have seen a number of techniques that have previously been the preserve of science fiction slowly transform into science factalready ai techniques are a deep part of our lives ai determines our search results translates our voices into meaningful instructions for computers and can even help sort our cucumbers more on that later in the next few years we’ll be using ai to drive our cars answer our customer service enquiries and well countless other thingsbut how did we get here where did this powerful new technology come from here’s ten of the big milestones that led us to these exciting timesthe concept of ai didn’t suddenly appear it is the subject of a deep philosophical debate which still rages today can a machine truly think like a human can a machine be human one of the first people to think about this was rené descartes way back in 1637 in a book called discourse on the method amazingly given at the time even an amstrad emiler would have seemed impossibly futuristic descartes actually summed up some off the crucial questions and challenges technologists would have to overcome“if there were machines which bore a resemblance to our bodies and imitated our actions as closely as possible for all practical purposes we should still have two very certain means of recognizing that they were not real men”a portrait of rené descarteshe goes on to explain that in his view machines could never use words or “put together signs” to “declare our thoughts to others” and that even if we could conceive of such a machine “it is not conceivable that such a machine should produce different arrangements of words so as to give an appropriately meaningful answer to whatever is said in its presence as the dullest of men can do”he then goes on to describe the big challenge of now creating a generalised ai rather than something narrowly focused and how the limitations of current ai would expose how the machine is definitely not a human“even though some machines might do some things as well as we do them or perhaps even better they would inevitably fail in others which would reveal that they are acting not from understanding but only from the disposition of their organs”so now thanks to descartes when it comes to ai we have the challengethe second major philosophical benchmark came courtesy of computer science pioneer alan turing in 1950 he first described what became known as the turing test and what he referred to as “the imitation game” a test for measuring when we can finally declare that machines can be intelligenthis test was simple if a judge cannot differentiate between a human and a machine say through a textonly interaction with both can the machine trick the judge into thinking that they are the one who is humanalan turing british computing pioneeramusingly at the time turing made a bold prediction about the future of computing and he reckoned that by the end of the 20th century his test will have had been passed he said“i believe that in about fifty years time it will be possible to programme computers with a storage capacity of about 1gb to make them play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have more than 70 percent chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning … i believe that at the end of the century the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted”sadly his prediction is a little premature as while we’re starting to see some truly impressive ai now back in 2000 the technology was much more primitive but hey at least he would have been impressed by hard disc capacity which averaged around 10gb at the turn of the century“neural network” is the fancy name that scientists give to trial and error the key concept unpinning modern ai essentially when it comes to training an ai the best way to do it is to have the system guess receive feedback and guess again constantly shifting the probabilities that it will get to the right answeran image created by a google neural networkwhat’s quite amazing then is that the first neural network was actually created way back in 1951 called “snarc” the stochastic neural analog reinforcement computer it was created by marvin minsky and dean edmonds and was not made of microchips and transistors but of vacuum tubes motors and clutchesthe challenge for this machine helping a virtual rat solve a maze puzzle the system would send instructions to navigate the maze and each time the effects of its actions would be fed back into the system the vacuum tubes being used to store the outcomes this meant that the machine was able to learn and shift the probabilities leading to a greater chance of making it through the mazeit’s essentially a very very simple version of the same process google uses to identify objects in photos todaywhen we think of selfdriving cars we think of something like google’s waymo project but amazingly way back in 1995 mercedesbenz managed to drive a modified sclass mostly autonomously all the way from munich to copenhagena recent mercedes sclassaccording to autoevolution the 1043 mile journey was made by stuffing effectively a supercomputer into the boot the car contained 60 transputer chips which at the time were state of the art when it came to parallel computing meaning that it could process a lot of driving data quickly a crucial part of making selfdriving cars sufficiently responsiveapparently the car reached speeds of up to 115mph and was actually fairly similar to autonomous cars of today as it was able to overtake and read road signs but if we were offered a trip umm… we insist you go firstthough neural networks had existed as a concept for some time see above it wasn’t until the late 1980s when there was a big shift amongst ai researchers from a “rules based” approach to one instead based on statistics or machine learning this means that rather than try to build systems that imitate intelligence by attempting to divine the rules by which humans operate instead taking a trialanderror approach and adjusting the probabilities based on feedback is a much better way to teach machines to think this is a big deal as it is this concept that underpins the amazing things that ai can do todaygil press at forbes argues that this switch was heralded in 1988 as ibm’s tj watson research center published a paper called “a statistical approach to language translation” which is specifically talking about using machine learning to do exactly what google translate works todayibm apparently fed into their system 22 millions pairs of sentences in french and english to train the system and the sentences were all taken from transcripts of the canadian parliament which publishes its records in both languages which sounds like a lot but is nothing compared to google having the entire internet at its disposal which explains why google translate is so creepily good todaydespite the shift in focus to statistical models rulesbased models were still in use and in 1997 ibm were responsible for perhaps the most famous chess match of all time as it’s deep blue computer bested world chess champion garry kasparov demonstrating how powerful machines can bethe bout was actually a rematch in 1996 kasparov bested deep blue 42 it was only in 1997 the machines got the upper hand winning two out of the six games outright and fighting kasparov to a draw in three moredeep blue’s intelligence was to a certain extent illusory ibm itself reckons that its machine is not using artificial intelligence instead deep blue uses a combination of brute force processing processing thousands of possible moves every second ibm fed the system with data on thousands of earlier games and each time the board changed with each movie deep blue wouldn’t be learning anything new but it would instead be looking up how previous grandmasters reacted in the same situations “he’s playing the ghosts of grandmasters past” as ibm puts itwhether this really counts as ai or not though what’s clear is that it was definitely a significant milestone and one that drew a lot of attention not just to the computational abilities of computers but also to the field as a whole since the faceoff with kasparov besting human players at games has become a major populist way of benchmarking machine intelligence as we saw again in 2011 when ibm’s watson system handily trounced two of the game show jeopardy’s best playersnatural language processing has long been a holy grail of artificial intelligence and crucial if we’re ever going to have a world where humanoid robots exist or where we can bark orders at our devices like in star trekand this is why siri which was built using the aforementioned statistical methods was so impressive created by sri international and even launched as a separate app on the ios app store it was quickly acquired by apple itself and deeply integrated into ios today it is one of the most high profile fruits of machine learning as it along with equivalent products from google the assistant microsoft cortana and of course amazon’s alexa has changed the way we interact with our devices in a way that would have seemed impossible just a few years earliertoday we take it for granted but you only have to ask anyone who ever tried to use a voice to text application before 2010 to appreciate just how far we’ve comelike voice recognition image recognition is another major challenge that ai is helping to beat in 2015 researchers concluded for the first time that machines in this case two competing systems from google and microsoft were better at identifying objects in images than humans were in over 1000 categoriesthese “deep learning” systems were successful in beating the imagenet challenge think something like the turing test but for image recognition and they are going to be fundamental if image recognition is ever going to scale beyond human abilitiesapplications for image recognition are of course numerous but one fun example that google likes to boast about when promoting its tensorflow machine learning platform is sorting cucumbers by using computer vision a farmer doesn’t need to employ humans to decide whether vegetables are ready for the dinner table the machines can decide automatically having been trained on earlier dataone of the big reasons ai is now such a big deal is because it is only over the last few years that the cost of crunching so much data has become affordableaccording to fortune it was only in the late 2000s that researchers realised that graphical processing units gpus which had been developed for 3d graphics and games were 2050 times better at deep learning computation than traditional cpus and once people realised this the amount of available computing power vastly increased enabling the the cloud ai platforms that power countless ai applications todayso thanks gamers your parents and spouses might not appreciate you spending so much time playing videogames but ai researchers sure doin march 2016 another ai milestone was reached as google’s alphago software was able to best lee sedol a topranked player of the boardgame go in an echo of garry kasparov’s historic matchwhat made it significant was not just that go is an even more mathematically complex game than chess but that it was trained using a combination of human and ai opponents google won four out of five of the matches by reportedly using 1920 cpus and 280 gpusperhaps even more significant is news from last year when a later version of the software alphago zero instead of using any previous data as alphago and deep blue had to learn the game it simply played thousands of matches against itself and after three days of training was able to beat the version of alphago which beat lee sedol 100 games to nil who needs to teach a machine to be smart when a machine can teach itselfget the best tech deals reviews product advice competitions unmissable tech news

the hottest buzzword in tech and with good reason after decades of research and development the last few years have seen a number of techniques that have previously been the preserve of science fiction slowly transform into science factalready ai techniques are a deep part of our lives ai determines our search results translates our voices into meaningful instructions for computers and can even help sort our cucumbers more on that later in the next few years we’ll be using ai to drive our cars answer our customer service enquiries and well countless other thingsbut how did we get here where did this powerful new technology come from here’s ten of the big milestones that led us to these exciting timesthe concept of ai didn’t suddenly appear it is the subject of a deep philosophical debate which still rages today can a machine truly think like a human can a machine be human one of the first people to think about this was rené descartes way back in 1637 in a book called discourse on the method amazingly given at the time even an amstrad emiler would have seemed impossibly futuristic descartes actually summed up some off the crucial questions and challenges technologists would have to overcome“if there were machines which bore a resemblance to our bodies and imitated our actions as closely as possible for all practical purposes we should still have two very certain means of recognizing that they were not real men”a portrait of rené descarteshe goes on to explain that in his view machines could never use words or “put together signs” to “declare our thoughts to others” and that even if we could conceive of such a machine “it is not conceivable that such a machine should produce different arrangements of words so as to give an appropriately meaningful answer to whatever is said in its presence as the dullest of men can do”he then goes on to describe the big challenge of now creating a generalised ai rather than something narrowly focused and how the limitations of current ai would expose how the machine is definitely not a human“even though some machines might do some things as well as we do them or perhaps even better they would inevitably fail in others which would reveal that they are acting not from understanding but only from the disposition of their organs”so now thanks to descartes when it comes to ai we have the challengethe second major philosophical benchmark came courtesy of computer science pioneer alan turing in 1950 he first described what became known as the turing test and what he referred to as “the imitation game” a test for measuring when we can finally declare that machines can be intelligenthis test was simple if a judge cannot differentiate between a human and a machine say through a textonly interaction with both can the machine trick the judge into thinking that they are the one who is humanalan turing british computing pioneeramusingly at the time turing made a bold prediction about the future of computing and he reckoned that by the end of the 20th century his test will have had been passed he said“i believe that in about fifty years time it will be possible to programme computers with a storage capacity of about 1gb to make them play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have more than 70 percent chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning … i believe that at the end of the century the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted”sadly his prediction is a little premature as while we’re starting to see some truly impressive ai now back in 2000 the technology was much more primitive but hey at least he would have been impressed by hard disc capacity which averaged around 10gb at the turn of the century“neural network” is the fancy name that scientists give to trial and error the key concept unpinning modern ai essentially when it comes to training an ai the best way to do it is to have the system guess receive feedback and guess again constantly shifting the probabilities that it will get to the right answeran image created by a google neural networkwhat’s quite amazing then is that the first neural network was actually created way back in 1951 called “snarc” the stochastic neural analog reinforcement computer it was created by marvin minsky and dean edmonds and was not made of microchips and transistors but of vacuum tubes motors and clutchesthe challenge for this machine helping a virtual rat solve a maze puzzle the system would send instructions to navigate the maze and each time the effects of its actions would be fed back into the system the vacuum tubes being used to store the outcomes this meant that the machine was able to learn and shift the probabilities leading to a greater chance of making it through the mazeit’s essentially a very very simple version of the same process google uses to identify objects in photos todaywhen we think of selfdriving cars we think of something like google’s waymo project but amazingly way back in 1995 mercedesbenz managed to drive a modified sclass mostly autonomously all the way from munich to copenhagena recent mercedes sclassaccording to autoevolution the 1043 mile journey was made by stuffing effectively a supercomputer into the boot the car contained 60 transputer chips which at the time were state of the art when it came to parallel computing meaning that it could process a lot of driving data quickly a crucial part of making selfdriving cars sufficiently responsiveapparently the car reached speeds of up to 115mph and was actually fairly similar to autonomous cars of today as it was able to overtake and read road signs but if we were offered a trip umm… we insist you go firstthough neural networks had existed as a concept for some time see above it wasn’t until the late 1980s when there was a big shift amongst ai researchers from a “rules based” approach to one instead based on statistics or machine learning this means that rather than try to build systems that imitate intelligence by attempting to divine the rules by which humans operate instead taking a trialanderror approach and adjusting the probabilities based on feedback is a much better way to teach machines to think this is a big deal as it is this concept that underpins the amazing things that ai can do todaygil press at forbes argues that this switch was heralded in 1988 as ibm’s tj watson research center published a paper called “a

defaultdict(<class 'str'>, {'title': 'noam chomsky where artificial intelligence went wrong the atlantic', 'h1': 'noam chomsky on where artificial intelligence went wrong', 'p': 'an extended conversation with the legendary linguistif one were to rank a list of civilizations greatest and most elusive intellectual challenges the problem of decoding ourselves—understanding the inner workings of our minds and our brains and how the architecture of these elements is encoded in our genome—would surely be at the top yet the diverse fields that took on this challenge from philosophy and psychology to computer science and neuroscience have been fraught with disagreement about the right approachin 1956 the computer scientist john mccarthy coined the term artificial intelligence ai to describe the study of intelligence by implementing its essential features on a computer instantiating an intelligent system using manmade hardware rather than our own biological hardware of cells and tissues would show ultimate understanding and have obvious practical applications in the creation of intelligent devices or even robotssome of mccarthys colleagues in neighboring departments however were more interested in how intelligence is implemented in humans and other animals first noam chomsky and others worked on what became cognitive science a field aimed at uncovering the mental representations and rules that underlie our perceptual and cognitive abilities chomsky and his colleagues had to overthrow the thendominant paradigm of behaviorism championed by harvard psychologist bf skinner where animal behavior was reduced to a simple set of associations between an action and its subsequent reward or punishment the undoing of skinners grip on psychology is commonly marked by chomskys 1959 critical review of skinners book verbal behavior a book in which skinner attempted to explain linguistic ability using behaviorist principlesskinners approach stressed the historical associations between a stimulus and the animals response—an approach easily framed as a kind of empirical statistical analysis predicting the future as a function of the past chomskys conception of language on the other hand stressed the complexity of internal representations encoded in the genome and their maturation in light of the right data into a sophisticated computational system one that cannot be usefully broken down into a set of associations behaviorist principles of associations could not explain the richness of linguistic knowledge our endlessly creative use of it or how quickly children acquire it with only minimal and imperfect exposure to language presented by their environment the language faculty as chomsky referred to it was part of the organisms genetic endowment much like the visual system the immune system and the circulatory system and we ought to approach it just as we approach these other more downtoearth biological systemsdavid marr a neuroscientist colleague of chomskys at mit defined a general framework for studying complex biological systems like the brain in his influential book vision one that chomskys analysis of the language capacity more or less fits into according to marr a complex biological system can be understood at three distinct levels the first level computational level describes the input and output to the system which define the task the system is performing in the case of the visual system the input might be the image projected on our retina and the output might our brains identification of the objects present in the image we had observed the second level algorithmic level describes the procedure by which an input is converted to an output ie how the image on our retina can be processed to achieve the task described by the computational level finally the third level implementation level describes how our own biological hardware of cells implements the procedure described by the algorithmic levelthe approach taken by chomsky and marr toward understanding how our minds achieve what they do is as different as can be from behaviorism the emphasis here is on the internal structure of the system that enables it to perform a task rather than on external association between past behavior of the system and the environment the goal is to dig into the black box that drives the system and describe its inner workings much like how a computer scientist would explain how a cleverly designed piece of software works and how it can be executed on a desktop computeras written today the history of cognitive science is a story of the unequivocal triumph of an essentially chomskyian approach over skinners behaviorist paradigm—an achievement commonly referred to as the cognitive revolution though chomsky himself rejects this term while this may be a relatively accurate depiction in cognitive science and psychology behaviorist thinking is far from dead in related disciplines behaviorist experimental paradigms and associationist explanations for animal behavior are used routinely by neuroscientists who aim to study the neurobiology of behavior in laboratory animals such as rodents where the systematic threelevel framework advocated by marr is not appliedin may of last year during the 150th anniversary of the massachusetts institute of technology a symposium on brains minds and machines took place where leading computer scientists psychologists and neuroscientists gathered to discuss the past and future of artificial intelligence and its connection to the neurosciencesthe gathering was meant to inspire multidisciplinary enthusiasm for the revival of the scientific question from which the field of artificial intelligence originated how does intelligence work how does our brain give rise to our cognitive abilities and could this ever be implemented in a machinenoam chomsky speaking in the symposium wasnt so enthused chomsky critiqued the field of ai for adopting an approach reminiscent of behaviorism except in more modern computationally sophisticated form chomsky argued that the fields heavy use of statistical techniques to pick regularities in masses of data is unlikely to yield the explanatory insight that science ought to offer for chomsky the new ai—focused on using statistical learning techniques to better mine and predict data— is unlikely to yield general principles about the nature of intelligent beings or about cognitionthis critique sparked an elaborate reply to chomsky from googles director of research and noted ai researcher peter norvig who defended the use of statistical models and argued that ais new methods and definition of progress is not far off from what happens in the other scienceschomsky acknowledged that the statistical approach might have practical value just as in the example of a useful search engine and is enabled by the advent of fast computers capable of processing massive data but as far as a science goes chomsky would argue it is inadequate or more harshly kind of shallow we wouldnt have taught the computer much about what the phrase physicist sir isaac newton really means even if we can build a search engine that returns sensible hits to users who type the phrase init turns out that related disagreements have been pressing biologists who try to understand more traditional biological systems of the sort chomsky likened to the language faculty just as the computing revolution enabled the massive data analysis that fuels the new ai so has the sequencing revolution in modern biology given rise to the blooming fields of genomics and systems biology highthroughput sequencing a technique by which millions of dna molecules can be read quickly and cheaply turned the sequencing of a genome from a decadelong expensive venture to an affordable commonplace laboratory procedure rather than painstakingly studying genes in isolation we can now observe the behavior of a system of genes acting in cells as a whole in hundreds or thousands of different conditionsthe sequencing revolution has just begun and a staggering amount of data has already been obtained bringing with it much promise and hype for new therapeutics and diagnoses for human disease for example when a conventional cancer drug fails to work for a group of patients the answer might lie in the genome of the patients which might have a special property that prevents the drug from acting with enough data comparing the relevant features of genomes from these cancer patients and the right control groups custommade drugs might be discovered leading to a kind of personalized medicine implicit in this endeavor is the assumption that with enough sophisticated statistical tools and a large enough collection of data signals of interest can be weeded it out from the noise in large and poorly understood biological systemsthe success of fields like personalized medicine and other offshoots of the sequencing revolution and the systemsbiology approach hinge upon our ability to deal with what chomsky called masses of unanalyzed data—placing biology in the center of a debate similar to the one taking place in psychology and artificial intelligence since the 1960ssystems biology did not rise without skepticism the great geneticist and nobelprize winning biologist sydney brenner once defined the field as low input high throughput no output science brenner a contemporary of chomsky who also participated in the same symposium on ai was equally skeptical about new systems approaches to understanding the brain when describing an upandcoming systems approach to mapping brain circuits called connectomics which seeks to map the wiring of all neurons in the brain ie diagramming which nerve cells are connected to others brenner called it a form of insanitybrenners catchphrase bite at systems biology and related techniques in neuroscience is not far off from chomskys criticism of ai an unlikely pair systems biology and artificial intelligence both face the same fundamental task of reverseengineering a highly complex system whose inner workings are largely a mystery yet everimproving technologies yield massive data related to the system only a fraction of which might be relevant do we rely on powerful computing and statistical approaches to tease apart signal from noise or do we look for the more basic principles that underlie the system and explain its essence the urge to gather more data is irresistible though its not always clear what theoretical framework these data might fit into these debates raise an old and general question in the philosophy of science what makes a satisfying scientific theory or explanation and how ought success be defined for sciencei sat with noam chomsky on an april afternoon in a somewhat disheveled conference room tucked in a hidden corner of frank gehrys dazzling stata center at mit i wanted to better understand chomskys critique of artificial intelligence and why it may be headed in the wrong direction i also wanted to explore the implications of this critique for other branches of science such neuroscience and systems biology which all face the challenge of reverseengineering complex systems—and where researchers often find themselves in an everexpanding sea of massive data the motivation for the interview was in part that chomsky is rarely asked about scientific topics nowadays journalists are too occupied with getting his views on us foreign policy the middle east the obama administration and other standard topics another reason was that chomsky belongs to a rare and special breed of intellectuals one that is quickly becoming extinct ever since isaiah berlins famous essay it has become a favorite pastime of academics to place various thinkers and scientists on the hedgehogfox continuum the hedgehog a meticulous and specialized worker driven by incremental progress in a clearly defined field versus the fox a flashier ideasdriven thinker who jumps from question to question ignoring field boundaries and applying his or her skills where they seem applicable chomsky is special because he makes this distinction seem like a tired old cliche chomskys depth doesnt come at the expense of versatility or breadth yet for the most part he devoted his entire scientific career to the study of defined topics in linguistics and cognitive science chomskys work has had tremendous influence on a variety of fields outside his own including computer science and philosophy and he has not shied away from discussing and critiquing the influence of these ideas making him a particularly interesting person to interview videos of the interview can be found herei want to start with a very basic question at the beginning of ai people were extremely optimistic about the fields progress but it hasnt turned out that way why has it been so difficult if you ask neuroscientists why understanding the brain is so difficult they give you very intellectually unsatisfying answers like that the brain has billions of cells and we cant record from all of them and so onchomsky theres something to that if you take a look at the progress of science the sciences are kind of a continuum but theyre broken up into fields the greatest progress is in the sciences that study the simplest systems so take say physics—greatest progress there but one of the reasons is that the physicists have an advantage that no other branch of sciences has if something gets too complicated they hand it to someone elselike the chemistschomsky if a molecule is too big you give it to the chemists the chemists for them if the molecule is too big or the system gets too big you give it to the biologists and if it gets too big for them they give it to the psychologists and finally it ends up in the hands of the literary critic and so on so what the neuroscientists are saying is not completely falsehowever it could be—and it has been argued in my view rather plausibly though neuroscientists dont like it—that neuroscience for the last couple hundred years has been on the wrong track theres a fairly recent book by a very good cognitive neuroscientist randy gallistel and king arguing—in my view plausibly—that neuroscience developed kind of enthralled to associationism and related views of the way humans and animals work and as a result theyve been looking for things that have the properties of associationist psychologylike hebbian plasticity editors note a theory attributed to donald hebb that associations between an environmental stimulus and a response to the stimulus can be encoded by strengthening of synaptic connections between neuronschomsky well like strengthening synaptic connections gallistel has been arguing for years that if you want to study the brain properly you should begin kind of like marr by asking what tasks is it performing so hes mostly interested in insects so if you want to study say the neurology of an ant you ask what does the ant do it turns out the ants do pretty complicated things like path integration for example if you look at bees bee navigation involves quite complicated computations involving position of the sun and so on and so forth but in general what he argues is that if you take a look at animal cognition human too its computational systems therefore you want to look the units of computation think about a turing machine say which is the simplest form of computation you have to find units that have properties like read write and address thats the minimal computational unit so you got to look in the brain for those youre never going to find them if you look for strengthening of synaptic connections or field properties and so on youve got to start by looking for whats there and whats working and you see that from marrs highest levelright but most neuroscientists do not sit down and describe the inputs and outputs to the problem that theyre studying theyre more driven by say putting a mouse in a learning task and recording as many neurons possible or asking if gene x is required for the learning task and so on these are the kinds of statements that their experiments generatechomsky thats rightis that conceptually flawedchomsky well you know you may get useful information from it but if whats actually going on is some kind of computation involving computational units youre not going to find them that way its kind of looking at the wrong lamp post sort of its a debate i dont think gallistels position is very widely accepted among neuroscientists but its not an implausible position and its basically in the spirit of marrs analysis so when youre studying vision he argues you first ask what kind of computational tasks is the visual system carrying out and then you look for an algorithm that might carry out those computations and finally you search for mechanisms of the kind that would make the algorithm work otherwise you may never find anything there are many examples of this even in the hard sciences but certainly in the soft sciences people tend to study what you know how to study i mean that makes sense you have certain experimental techniques you have certain level of understanding you try to push the envelope—which is okay i mean its not a criticism but people do what you can do on the other hand its worth thinking whether youre aiming in the right direction and it could be that if you take roughly the marrgallistel point of view which personally im sympathetic to you would work differently look for different kind of experimentsright so i think a key idea in marr is like you said finding the right units to describing the problem sort of the right level of abstraction if you will so if we take a concrete example of a new field in neuroscience called connectomics where the goal is to find the wiring diagram of very complex organisms find the connectivity of all the neurons in say human cerebral cortex or mouse cortex this approach was criticized by sidney brenner who in many ways is historically one of the originators of the approach advocates of this field dont stop to ask if the wiring diagram is the right level of abstraction—maybe its not so what is your view on thatchomsky well there are much simpler questions like here at mit theres been an interdisciplinary program on the nematode c elegans for decades and as far as i understand even with this miniscule animal where you know the wiring diagram i think theres 800 neurons or somethingi think 300chomsky … still you cant predict what the thing c elegans nematode is going to do maybe because youre looking in the wrong placeid like to shift the topic to different methodologies that were used in ai so good old fashioned ai as its labeled now made strong use of formalisms in the tradition of gottlob frege and bertrand russell mathematical logic for example or derivatives of it like nonmonotonic reasoning and so on its interesting from a history of science perspective that even very recently these approaches have been almost wiped out from the mainstream and have been largely replaced—in the field that calls itself ai now—by probabilistic and statistical models my question is what do you think explains that shift and is it a step in the right directionchomsky i heard pat winston give a talk about this years ago one of the points he made was that ai and robotics got to the point where you could actually do things that were useful so it turned to the practical applications and somewhat maybe not abandoned but put to the side the more fundamental scientific questions just caught up in the success of the technology and achieving specific goalsso it shifted to engineeringchomsky it became well which is understandable but would of course direct people away from the original questions i have to say myself that i was very skeptical about the original work i thought it was first of all way too optimistic it was assuming you could achieve things that required real understanding of systems that were barely understood and you just cant get to that understanding by throwing a complicated machine at it if you try to do that you are led to a conception of success which is selfreinforcing because you do get success in terms of this conception but its very different from whats done in the sciences so for example take an extreme case suppose that somebody says he wants to eliminate the physics department and do it the right way the right way is to take endless numbers of videotapes of whats happening outside the video and feed them into the biggest and fastest computer gigabytes of data and do complex statistical analysis—you know bayesian this and that editors note a modern approach to analysis of data which makes heavy use of probability theory—and youll get some kind of prediction about whats gonna happen outside the window next in fact you get a much better prediction than the physics department will ever give well if success is defined as getting a fair approximation to a mass of chaotic unanalyzed data then its way better to do it this way than to do it the way the physicists do you know no thought experiments about frictionless planes and so on and so forth but you wont get the kind of understanding that the sciences have always been aimed at—what youll get at is an approximation to whats happeningand thats done all over the place suppose you want to predict tomorrows weather one way to do it is okay ill get my statistical priors if you like theres a high probability that tomorrows weather here will be the same as it was yesterday in cleveland so ill stick that in and where the sun is will have some effect so ill stick that in and you get a bunch of assumptions like that you run the experiment you look at it over and over again you correct it by bayesian methods you get better priors you get a pretty good approximation of what tomorrows weather is going to be thats not what meteorologists do—they want to understand how its working and these are just two different concepts of what success means of what achievement is in my own field language fields its all over the place like computational cognitive science applied to language the concept of success thats used is virtually always this so if you get more and more data and better and better statistics you can get a better and better approximation to some immense corpus of text like everything in the wall street journal archives—but you learn nothing about the languagea very different approach which i think is the right approach is to try to see if you can understand what the fundamental principles are that deal with the core properties and recognize that in the actual usage theres going to be a thousand other variables intervening—kind of like whats happening outside the window and youll sort of tack those on later on if you want better approximations thats a different approach these are just two different concepts of science the second one is what science has been since galileo thats modern science the approximating unanalyzed data kind is sort of a new approach not totally theres things like it in the past its basically a new approach that has been accelerated by the existence of massive memories very rapid processing which enables you to do things like this that you couldnt have done by hand but i think myself that it is leading subjects like computational cognitive science into a direction of maybe some practical applicability… in engineeringchomsky … but away from understanding yeah maybe some effective engineering and its kind of interesting to see what happened to engineering so like when i got to mit it was 1950s this was an engineering school there was a very good math department physics department but they were service departments they were teaching the engineers tricks they could use the electrical engineering department you learned how to build a circuit well if you went to mit in the 1960s or now its completely different no matter what engineering field youre in you learn the same basic science and mathematics and then maybe you learn a little bit about how to apply it but thats a very different approach and it resulted maybe from the fact that really for the first time in history the basic sciences like physics had something really to tell engineers and besides technologies began to change very fast so not very much point in learning the technologies of today if its going to be different 10 years from now so you have to learn the fundamental science thats going to be applicable to whatever comes along next and the same thing pretty much happened in medicine so in the past century again for the first time biology had something serious to tell to the practice of medicine so you had to understand biology if you want to be a doctor and technologies again will change well i think thats the kind of transition from something like an art that you learn how to practice an analog would be trying to match some data that you dont understand in some fashion maybe building something that will work—to science what happened in the modern period roughly galilean sciencei see returning to the point about bayesian statistics in models of language and cognition youve argued famously that speaking of the probability of a sentence is unintelligible on its ownchomsky … well you can get a number if you want but it doesnt mean anythingit doesnt mean anything but it seems like theres almost a trivial way to unify the probabilistic method with acknowledging that there are very rich internal mental representations comprised of rules and other symbolic structures and the goal of probability theory is just to link noisy sparse data in the world with these internal symbolic structures and that doesnt commit you to saying anything about how these structures were acquired—they could have been there all along or there partially with some parameters being tuned whatever your conception is but probability theory just serves as a kind of glue between noisy data and very rich mental representationschomsky well theres nothing wrong with probability theory theres nothing wrong with statisticsbut does it have a rolechomsky if you can use it fine but the question is what are you using it for first of all first question is is there any point in understanding noisy data is there some point to understanding whats going on outside the windowwell we are bombarded with it noisy data its one of marrs examples we are faced with noisy data all the time from our retina tochomsky thats true but what he says is lets ask ourselves how the biological system is picking out of that noise things that are significant the retina is not trying to duplicate the noise that comes in its saying im going to look for this that and the other thing and its the same with say language acquisition the newborn infant is confronted with massive noise what william james called a blooming buzzing confusion just a mess if say an ape or a kitten or a bird or whatever is presented with that noise thats where it ends however the human infants somehow instantaneously and reflexively picks out of the noise some scattered subpart which is languagerelated thats the first step well how is it doing that its not doing it by statistical analysis because the ape can do roughly the same probabilistic analysis its looking for particular things so psycholinguists neurolinguists and others are trying to discover the particular parts of the computational system and of the neurophysiology that are somehow tuned to particular aspects of the environment well it turns out that there actually are neural circuits which are reacting to particular kinds of rhythm which happen to show up in language like syllable length and so on and theres some evidence that thats one of the first things that the infant brain is seeking—rhythmic structures and going back to gallistel and marr its got some computational system inside which is saying okay heres what i do with these things and say by nine months the typical infant has rejected—eliminated from its repertoire—the phonetic distinctions that arent used in its own language so initially of course any infant is tuned to any language but say a japanese kid at nine months wont react to the rl distinction anymore thats kind of weeded out so the system seems to sort out lots of possibilities and restrict it to just ones that are part of the language and theres a narrow set of those you can make up a nonlanguage in which the infant could never do it and then youre looking for other things for example to get into a more abstract kind of language theres substantial evidence by now that such a simple thing as linear order what precedes what doesnt enter into the syntactic and semantic computational systems theyre just not designed to look for linear order so you find overwhelmingly that more abstract notions of distance are computed and not linear distance and you can find some neurophysiological evidence for this too like if artificial languages are invented and taught to people which use linear order like you negate a sentence by doing something to the third word people can solve the puzzle but apparently the standard language areas of the brain are not activated—other areas are activated so theyre treating it as a puzzle not as a language problem you need more work butyou take that as convincing evidence that activation or lack of activation for the brain areachomsky … its evidence youd want more of course but this is the kind of evidence both on the linguistics side you look at how languages work—they dont use things like third word in sentence take a simple sentence like instinctively eagles that fly swim well instinctively goes with swim it doesnt go with fly even though it doesnt make sense and thats reflexive instinctively the adverb isnt looking for the nearest verb its looking for the structurally most prominent one thats a much harder computation but thats the only computation which is ever used linear order is a very easy computation but its never used theres a ton of evidence like this and a little neurolinguistic evidence but they point in the same direction and as you go to more complex structures thats where you find more and more of thatthats in my view at least the way to try to discover how the system is actually working just like in vision in marrs lab people like shimon ullman discovered some pretty remarkable things like the rigidity principle youre not going to find that by statistical analysis of data but he did find it by carefully designed experiments then you look for the neurophysiology and see if you can find something there that carries out these computations i think its the same in language the same in studying our arithmetical capacity planning almost anything you look at just trying to deal with the unanalyzed chaotic data is unlikely to get you anywhere just like as it wouldnt have gotten galileo anywhere in fact if you go back to this in the 17th century it wasnt easy for people like galileo and other major scientists to convince the nsf national science foundation of the day—namely the aristocrats—that any of this made any sense i mean why study balls rolling down frictionless planes which dont exist why not study the growth of flowers well if you tried to study the growth of flowers at that time you would get maybe a statistical analysis of what things looked likeits worth remembering that with regard to cognitive science were kind of pregalilean just beginning to open up the subject and i think you can learn something from the way science worked back then in fact one of the founding experiments in history of chemistry was about 1640 or so when somebody proved to the satisfaction of the scientific world all the way up to newton that water can be turned into living matter the way they did it was—of course nobody knew anything about photosynthesis—so what you do is you take a pile of earth you heat it so all the water escapes you weigh it and put it in a branch of a willow tree and pour water on it and measure you the amount of water you put in when youre done you the willow tree is grown you again take the earth and heat it so all the water is gone—same as before therefore youve shown that water can turn into an oak tree or something it is an experiment its sort of right but its just that you dont know what things you ought to be looking for and they werent known until priestly found that air is a component of the world its got nitrogen and so on and you learn about photosynthesis and so on then you can redo the experiment and find out whats going on but you can easily be misled by experiments that seem to work because you dont know enough about what to look for and you can be misled even more if you try to study the growth of trees by just taking a lot of data about how trees growing feeding it into a massive computer doing some statistics and getting an approximation of what happenedin the domain of biology would you consider the work of mendel as a successful case where you take this noisy data— essentially counts—and you leap to postulate this theoretical objectchomsky … well throwing out a lot of the data that didnt work… but seeing the ratio that made sense given the theorychomsky yeah he did the right thing he let the theory guide the data there was counter data which was more or less dismissed you know you dont put it in your papers and he was of course talking about things that nobody could find like you couldnt find the units that he was postulating but thats sure thats the way science works same with chemistry chemistry until my childhood not that long ago was regarded as a calculating device because you couldnt reduce to physics so its just some way of calculating the result of experiments the bohr atom was treated that way its the way of calculating the results of experiments but it cant be real science because you cant reduce it to physics which incidentally turned out to be true you couldnt reduce it to physics because physics was wrong when quantum physics came along you could unify it with virtually unchanged chemistry so the project of reduction was just the wrong project the right project was to see how these two ways of looking at the world could be unified and it turned out to be a surprise—they were unified by radically changing the underlying science that could very well be the case with say psychology and neuroscience i mean neuroscience is nowhere near as advanced as physics was a century agothat would go against the reductionist approach of looking for molecules that are correlates ofchomsky yeah in fact the reductionist approach has often been shown to be wrong the unification approach makes sense but unification might not turn out to be reduction because the core science might be misconceived as in the physicschemistry case and i suspect very likely in the neurosciencepsychology case if gallistel is right that would be a case in point that yeah they can be unified but with a different approach to the neurosciencesso is that a worthy goal of unification or the fields should proceed in parallelchomsky well unification is kind of an intuitive ideal part of the scientific mystique if you like its that youre trying to find a unified theory of the world now maybe there isnt one maybe different parts work in different ways but your assumption is until im proven wrong definitively ill assume that theres a unified account of the world and its my task to try to find it and the unification may not come out by reduction—it often doesnt and thats kind of the guiding logic of david marrs approach what you discover at the computational level ought to be unified with what youll some day find out at the mechanism level but maybe not in terms of the way we now understand the mechanismsand implicit in marr it seems that you cant work on all three in parallel computational algorithmic implementation levels it has to proceed topdown which is a very stringent requirement given that science usually doesnt work that waychomsky well he wouldnt have said it has to be rigid like for example discovering more about the mechanisms might lead you to change your concept of computation but theres kind of a logical precedence which isnt necessarily the research precedence since in research everything goes on at the same time but i think that the rough picture is okay though i should mention that marrs conception was designed for input systemsinformationprocessing systemschomsky yeah like vision theres some data out there—its a processing system —and something goes on inside it isnt very well designed for cognitive systems like take your capacity to take out arithmetical operationsits very poor but yeahchomsky okay laughs but its an internal capacity you know your brain is a controlling unit of some kind of turing machine and it has access to some external data like memory time and so on and in principle you could multiply anything but of course not in practice if you try to find out what that internal system is of yours the marr hierarchy doesnt really work very well you can talk about the computational level—maybe the rules i have are peanos axioms editors note a mathematical theory named after italian mathematician giuseppe peano that describes a core set of basic rules of arithmetic and natural numbers from which many useful facts about arithmetic can be deduced or something whatever they are—thats the computational level in theory though we dont know how you can talk about the neurophysiological level nobody knows how but theres no real algorithmic level because theres no calculation of knowledge its just a system of knowledge to find out the nature of the system of knowledge there is no algorithm because there is no process using the system of knowledge thatll have a process but thats something differentbut since we make mistakes isnt that evidence of a process gone wrongchomsky thats the process of using the internal system but the internal system itself is not a process because it doesnt have an algorithm take say ordinary mathematics if you take peanos axioms and rules of inference they determine all arithmetical computations but theres no algorithm if you ask how does a number theoretician applies these well all kinds of ways maybe you dont start with the axioms and start with the rules of inference you take the theorem and see if i can establish a lemma and if it works then see if i can try to ground this lemma in something and finally you get a proof which is a geometrical objectbut thats a fundamentally different activity from me adding up small numbers in my head which surely does have some kind of algorithmchomsky not necessarily theres an algorithm for the process in both cases but theres no algorithm for the system itself its kind of a category mistake you dont ask the question whats the process defined by peanos axioms and the rules of inference theres no process there can be a process of using them and it could be a complicated process and the same is true of your calculating the internal system that you have—for that the question of process doesnt arise but for your using that internal system it arises and you may carry out multiplications all kinds of ways like maybe when you add 7 and 6 lets say one algorithm is to say ill see how much it takes to get to 10—it takes 3 and now ive got 4 left so i gotta go from 10 and add 4 i get 14 thats an algorithm for adding its actually one i was taught in kindergarten thats one way to addbut there are other ways to add—theres no kind of right algorithm these are algorithms for carrying out the process the cognitive system thats in your head and for that system you dont ask about algorithms you can ask about the computational level you can ask about the mechanism level but the algorithm level doesnt exist for that system its the same with language language is kind of like the arithmetical capacity theres some system in there that determines the sound and meaning of an infinite array of possible sentences but theres no question about what the algorithm is like theres no question about what a formal system of arithmetic tells you about proving theorems the use of the system is a process and you can study it in terms of marrs level but its important to be conceptually clear about these distinctionsit just seems like an astounding task to go from a computational level theory like peano axioms to marr level 3 of thechomsky mechanisms… mechanisms and implementationschomsky oh yeah well… without an algorithm at leastchomsky well i dont think thats true maybe information about how its used thatll tell you something about the mechanisms but some higher intelligence—maybe higher than ours—would see that theres an internal system its got a physiological basis and i can study the physiological basis of that internal system not even looking at the process by which its used maybe looking at the process by which its used maybe gives you helpful information about how to proceed but its conceptually a different problem thats the question of whats the best way to study something so maybe the best way to study the relation between peanos axioms and neurons is by watching mathematicians prove theorems but thats just because itll give you information that may be helpful the actual end result of that will be an account of the system in the brain the physiological basis for it with no reference to any algorithm the algorithms are about a process of using it which may help you get answers maybe like incline planes tell you something about the rate of fall but if you take a look at newtons laws they dont say anything about incline planesright so the logic for studying cognitive and language systems using this kind of marr approach makes sense but since youve argued that language capacity is part of the genetic endowment you could apply it to other biological systems like the immune system the circulatory systemchomsky certainly i think its very similar you can say the same thing about study of the immune systemit might even be simpler in fact to do it for those systems than for cognitionchomsky though youd expect different answers you can do it for the digestive system suppose somebodys studying the digestive system well theyre not going to study what happens when you have a stomach flu or when youve just eaten a big mac or something lets go back to taking pictures outside the window one way of studying the digestive system is just to take all data you can find about what digestive systems do under any circumstances toss the data into a computer do statistical analysis you get something but its not gonna be what any biologist would do they want to abstract away at the very beginning from what are presumed— maybe wrongly you can always be wrong—irrelevant variables like do you have stomach flubut thats precisely what the biologists are doing they are taking the sick people with the sick digestive system comparing them to the normals and measuring these molecular propertieschomsky theyre doing it in an advanced stage they already understand a lot about the study of the digestive system before we compare them otherwise you wouldnt know what to compare and why is one sick and one isntwell theyre relying on statistical analysis to pick out the features that discriminate its a highly fundable approach because youre claiming to study sick peoplechomsky it may be the way to fund things like maybe the way to fund study of language is to say maybe help cure autism thats a different question laughs but the logic of the search is to begin by studying the system abstracted from what you plausibly take to be irrelevant intrusions see if you can find its basic nature—then ask well what happens when i bring in some of this other stuff like stomach fluit still seems like theres a difficulty in applying marrs levels to these kinds of systems if you ask what is the computational problem that the brain is solving we have kind of an answer its sort of like a computer but if you ask what is the computational problem thats being solved by the lung thats very difficult to even think— its not obviously an informationprocessing kind of problemchomsky no but theres no reason to assume that all of biology is computational there may be reasons to assume that cognition is and in fact gallistel is not saying that everything is in the body ought to be studied by finding readwriteaddress unitsit just seems contrary to any evolutionary intuition these systems evolved together reusing many of the same parts same molecules pathways cells are computing thingschomsky you dont study the lung by asking what cells compute you study the immune system and the visual system but youre not going to expect to find the same answers an organism is a highly modular system has a lot of complex subsystems which are more or less internally integrated they operate by different principles the biology is highly modular you dont assume its all just one big mess all acting the same wayno sure but im saying you would apply the same approach to study each of the moduleschomsky not necessarily not if the modules are different some of the modules may be computational others may not beso what would you think would be an adequate theory that is explanatory rather than just predicting data the statistical way what would be an adequate theory of these systems that are not computing systems—can we even understand themchomsky sure you can understand a lot about say what makes an embryo turn into a chicken rather than a mouse lets say its a very intricate system involves all kinds of chemical interactions all sorts of other things even the nematode its by no means obviously—in fact there are reports from the study here—that its all just a matter of a neural net you have to look into complex chemical interactions that take place in the brain in the nervous system you have to look into each system on its own these chemical interactions might not be related to how your arithmetical capacity works —probably arent but they might very well be related to whether you decide to raise your arm or lower itthough if you study the chemical interactions it might lead you into what youve called just a redescription of the phenomenachomsky or an explanation because maybe thats directly crucially involvedbut if you explain it in terms of chemical x has to be turned on or gene x has to be turned on youve not really explained how organismdetermination is done youve simply found a switch and hit that switchchomsky but then you look further and find out what makes this gene do such and such under these circumstances and do something else under different circumstancesbut if genes are the wrong level of abstraction youd be screwedchomsky then you wont get the right answer and maybe theyre not for example its notoriously difficult to account for how an organism arises from a genome theres all kinds of production going on in the cell if you just look at gene action you may not be in the right level of abstraction you never know thats what you try to study i dont think theres any algorithm for answering those questions you tryso i want to shift gears more toward evolution youve criticized a very interesting position youve called phylogenetic empiricism youve criticized this position for not having explanatory power it simply states that well the mind is the way it because of adaptations to the environment that were selected for and these were selected for by natural selection youve argued that this doesnt explain anything because you can always appeal to these two principles of mutation and selectionchomsky well you can wave your hands at them but they might be right it could be that say the development of your arithmetical capacity arose from random mutation and selection if it turned out to be true fineit seems like a truismchomsky well i mean doesnt mean its false truisms are true laughsbut they dont explain muchchomsky maybe thats the highest level of explanation you can get you can invent a world—i dont think its our world—but you can invent a world in which nothing happens except random changes in objects and selection on the basis of external forces i dont think thats the way our world works i dont think its the way any biologist thinks it is there are all kind of ways in which natural law imposes channels within which selection can take place and some things can happen and other things dont happen plenty of things that go on in the biology in organisms arent like this so take the first step meiosis why do cells split into spheres and not cubes its not random mutation and natural selection its a law of physics theres no reason to think that laws of physics stop there they work all the way throughwell they constrain the biology surechomsky okay well then its not just random mutation and selection its random mutation selection and everything that matters like laws of physicsso is there room for these approaches which are now labeled comparative genomics like the broad institute here at mitharvard is generating massive amounts of data of different genomes different animals different cells under different conditions and sequencing any molecule that is sequenceable is there anything that can be gleaned about these highlevel cognitive tasks from these comparative evolutionary studies or is it prematurechomsky i am not saying its the wrong approach but i dont know anything that can be drawn from it nor would you expect toyou dont have any examples where this evolutionary analysis has informed something like foxp2 mutations editors note a gene that is thought be implicated in speech or language capacities a family with a stereotyped speech disorder was found to have genetic mutations that disrupt this gene this gene evolved to have several mutations unique to the human evolutionary lineagechomsky foxp2 is kind of interesting but it doesnt have anything to do with language it has to do with fine motor coordinations and things like that which takes place in the use of language like when you speak you control your lips and so on but all thats very peripheral to language and we know that so for example whether you use the articulatory organs or sign you know hand motions its the same language in fact its even being analyzed and produced in the same parts of the brain even though one of them is moving your hands and the other is moving your lips so whatever the externalization is it seems quite peripheral i think theyre too complicated to talk about but i think if you look closely at the design features of language you get evidence for that there are interesting cases in the study of language where you find conflicts between computational efficiency and communicative efficiencytake this case i even mentioned of linear order if you want to know which verb the adverb attaches to the infant reflexively using minimal structural distance not minimal linear distance well its using minimal linear distances computationally easy but it requires having linear order available and if linear order is only a reflex of the sensorymotor system which makes sense it wont be available thats evidence that the mapping of the internal system to the sensorymotor system is peripheral to the workings of the computational systembut it might constrain it like physics constrains meiosischomsky it might but theres very little evidence of that so for example the left end—left in the sense of early—of a sentence has different properties from the right end if you want to ask a question lets say who did you see you put the who in front not in the end in fact in every language in which a whphrase like who or which book or something—moves to somewhere else it moves to the left not to the right thats very likely a processing constraint the sentence opens by telling you the hearer heres what kind of a sentence it is if its at the end you have to have the whole declarative sentence and at the end you get the information im asking about if you spell it out it could be a processing constraint so thats a case if true in which the processing constraint externalization do affect the computational character of the syntax and semanticsthere are cases where you find clear conflicts between computational efficiency and communicative efficiency take a simple case structural ambiguity if i say visiting relatives can be a nuisance—thats ambiguous relatives that visit or going to visit relatives it turns out in every such case thats known the ambiguity is derived by simply allowing the rules to function freely with no constraints and that sometimes yields ambiguities so its computationally efficient but its inefficient for communication because it leads to unresolvable ambiguityor take what are called gardenpath sentences sentences like the horse raced past the barn fell people presented with that dont understand it because the way its put theyre led down a garden path the horse raced past the barn sounds like a sentence and then you ask whats fell doing there at the end on the other hand if you think about it its a perfectly well formed sentence it means the horse that was raced past the barn by someone fell but the rules of the language when they just function happen to give you a sentence which is unintelligible because of the gardenpath phenomena and there are lots of cases like that there are things you just cant say for some reason so if i say the mechanics fixed the cars and you say they wondered if the mechanics fixed the cars you can ask questions about the cars how many cars did they wonder if the mechanics fixed more or less okay suppose you want to ask a question about the mechanics how many mechanics did they wonder if fixed the cars somehow it doesnt work cant say that its a fine thought but you cant say it well if you look into it in detail the most efficient computational rules prevent you from saying it but for expressing thought for communication itd be better if you could say it—so thats a conflictand in fact every case of a conflict thats known computational efficiency wins the externalization is yielding all kinds of ambiguities but for simple computational reasons it seems that the system internally is just computing efficiently it doesnt care about the externalization well i havent made that a very plausible but if you spell it out it can be made quite a convincing argument i thinkthat tells something about evolution what it strongly suggests is that in the evolution of language a computational system developed and later on it was externalized and if you think about how a language might have evolved youre almost driven to that position at some point in human evolution and its apparently pretty recent given the archeological record—maybe last hundred thousand years which is nothing—at some point a computational system emerged with had new properties that other organisms dont have that has kind of arithmetical type propertiesit enabled better thought before externalizationchomsky it gives you thought some rewiring of the brain that happens in a single person not in a group so that person had the capacity for thought—the group didnt so there isnt any point in externalization later on if this genetic change proliferates maybe a lot of people have it okay then theres a point in figuring out a way to map it to the sensorymotor system and thats externalization but its a secondary processunless the externalization and the internal thought system are coupled in ways we just dont predictchomsky we dont predict and they dont make a lot of sense why should it be connected to the external system in fact say your arithmetical capacity isnt and there are other animals like songbirds which have internal computational systems bird song its not the same system but its some kind of internal computational system and it is externalized but sometimes its not a chick in some species acquires the song of that species but doesnt produce it until maturity during that early period it has the song but it doesnt have the externalization system actually thats true of humans too like a human infant understands a lot more than it can produce—plenty of experimental evidence for this meaning its got the internal system somehow but it cant externalize it maybe it doesnt have enough memory or whatever it may beid like to close with one question about the philosophy of science in a recent interview you said that part of the problem is that scientists dont think enough about what theyre up to you mentioned that you taught a philosophy of science course at mit and people would read say willard van orman quine and it would go in one ear out the other and people would go back doing the same kind of science that they were doing what are the insights that have been obtained in philosophy of science that are most relevant to scientists who are trying to lets say explain biology and give an explanatory theory rather than redescription of the phenomena what do you expect from such a theory and what are the insights that help guide science in that way rather than guiding it towards behaviorism which seems to be an intuition that many say neuroscientists havechomsky philosophy of science is a very interesting field but i dont think it really contribute to science it learns from science it tries to understand what the sciences do why do they achieve things what are the wrong paths see if we can codify that and come to understand what i think is valuable is the history of science i think we learn a lot of things from the history of science that can be very valuable to the emerging sciences particularly when we realize that in say the emerging cognitive sciences we really are in a kind of pregalilean stage we dont know what were looking for anymore than galileo did and theres a lot to learn from that so for example one striking fact about early science not just galileo but the galilean breakthrough was the recognition that simple things are puzzlingtake say if im holding this here cup of water and say the water is boiling putting hand over water the steam will rise but if i take my hand away the cup will fall well why does the cup fall and the steam rise well for millennia there was a satisfactory answer to that theyre seeking their natural placelike in aristotelian physicschomsky thats the aristotelian physics the best and greatest scientists thought that was answer galileo allowed himself to be puzzled by it as soon as you allow yourself to be puzzled by it you immediately find that all your intuitions are wrong like the fall of a big mass and a small mass and so on all your intuitions are wrong—there are puzzles everywhere you look thats something to learn from the history of science take the one example that i gave to you instinctively eagles that fly swim nobody ever thought that was puzzling—yeah why not but if you think about it its very puzzling youre using a complex computation instead of a simple one well if you allow yourself to be puzzled by that like the fall of a cup you ask why and then youre led down a path to some pretty interesting answers like maybe linear order just isnt part of the computational system which is a strong claim about the architecture of the mind —it says its just part of the externalization system secondary you know and that opens up all sorts of other paths same with everything elsetake another case the difference between reduction and unification history of science gives some very interesting illustrations of that like chemistry and physics and i think theyre quite relevant to the state of the cognitive and neurosciences todaywe want to hear what you think about this article submit a letter to the

the impossible burger look and taste like real beef', 'h4': 'follow thomaslatestrelated', 'p': 'sophia’s uncannyvalley face made of hanson robotics’ patented frubber is rapidly becoming an iconic image in the field of artificial intelligence she has been interviewed on shows like 60 minutes made a saudi citizen and even appeared before the united nations every media appearance sparks comments about how artificial intelligence is going to completely transform the world this is pretty good pr for a chatbot in a robot suitbut it’s also riding the hype around artificial intelligence and more importantly people’s uncertainty around what constitutes artificial intelligence what can feasibly be done with it and how close various milestones may bethere are various definitions of artificial intelligencefor example there’s the cultural idea from films like ex machina for example of a machine that has humanlevel artificial general intelligence but humanlevel intelligence or performance is also seen as an important benchmark for those that develop software that aims to mimic narrow aspects of human intelligence for example medical diagnosticsthe latter software might be referred to as narrow ai or weak ai weak it may be but it can still disrupt society and the world of work substantiallythen there’s the philosophical idea championed by ray kurzweil nick bostrom and others of a recursivelyimproving superintelligent ai that eventually compares to human intelligence in the same way as we outrank bacteria such a scenario would clearly change the world in ways that are difficult to imagine and harder to quantify weighty tomes are devoted to studying how to navigate the perils pitfalls and possibilities of this future the ones by bostrom and max tegmark epitomize this type of thinkingthis more often than not is the scenario that stephen hawking and various silicon valley luminaries have warned about when they view ai as an existential riskthose working on superintelligence as a hypothetical future may lament for humanity when people take sophia seriously yet without hype surrounding the achievements of narrow ai in industry and the immense advances in computational power and algorithmic complexity driven by these achievements they may not get funding to research ai safetysome of those who work on algorithms at the front line find the whole superintelligence debate premature casting fear and uncertainty over work that has the potential to benefit humanity others even call it a dangerous distraction from the very real problems that narrow ai and automation will pose although few actually work in the field but even as they attempt to draw this distinction surely some of their vc funding and share price relies on the idea that if superintelligent ai is possible and as worldchanging as everyone believes it will be google might get there first these dreams may drive people to join themyet the ambiguity is stark someone working on say mit intelligence quest or google brain might be attempting to reach agi by studying human psychology and learning or animal neuroscience perhaps attempting to simulate the simple brain of a nematode worm another researcher who we might consider to be “narrow” in focus trains a neural network to diagnose cancer with higher accuracy than any humanwhere should something like sophia a chatbot that flatters to deceive as a general intelligence sit its creator says “as a hardcore transhumanist i see these as somewhat peripheral transitional questions which will seem interesting only during a relatively short period of time before agis become massively superhuman in intelligence and capability i am more interested in the use of sophia as a platform for general intelligence rd” this illustrates a further source of confusion people working in the field disagree about the end goal of their work how close an agi might be and even what artificial intelligence isstanford’s jerry kaplan is one of those who lays some of the blame at the feet of ai researchers themselves “public discourse about ai has become untethered from reality in part because the field doesn’t have a coherent theory without such a theory people can’t gauge progress in the field and characterizing advances becomes anyone’s guess” he would prefer a less mysticismloaded term like “anthropic computing” defining intelligence is difficult enough but efforts like stanford’s ai index go some way towards establishing a framework for tracking progress in different fieldsthe ambiguity and confusion surrounding ai is part of a broader trend a combination of marketing hype and the truly impressive pace of technology can cause us to overestimate our own technological capabilities or achievements in artificial intelligence which requires highly valued expertise and expensive hardware the future remains unevenly distributed for all the hype over renewables in the last 30 years fossil fuels have declined from providing 88 percent of our energy to 85 percentwe can underestimate the vulnerabilities how many people have seen videos of sophia or atlas or heard hype about alphago okay now how many know that some neural networks can be fooled by adversarial examples that could be printed out as stickers overestimating what technology can do can leave you dangerously dependent on it or blind to the risks you’re runningat the same time there is a very real risk that technological capacities and impacts are underestimated or missed entirely take the recent controversy over social media engineering in the us election no one can agree over the impact that automated “bots” have had refer to these algorithms as “artificial intelligence” and people will think you’re a conspiracy theorist yet they can still have a societal impactthose who work on superintelligence argue that development could accelerate rapidly that we could be in the knee of an exponential curve given that the problem they seek to solve “what should an artificial superintelligence optimize” is dangerously close to “what should the mind of god look like” they might need all the time they can getwe urgently need to move away from an artificial dichotomy between technohype and technofear oscillating from one to the other is no way to ensure safe advances in technology we need to communicate with those at the forefront of ai research in an honest nuanced way and listen to their opinions and arguments preferably without using a picture of the terminator in the articlethose who work with ai and robotics should ensure they don’t mislead the public we need to ensure that policymakers have the best information possible luckily groups like openai are helping with thisalgorithms are already reshaping our society regardless

defaultdict(<class 'str'>, {'title': 'can artificial intelligence be smarter than a person the atlantic', 'h1': 'the spooky genius of artificial intelligence', 'p': 'ai doesn’t think—it evolvessubscribe to crazygenius apple podcasts spotify stitcher google playcan artificial intelligence be smarter than a person answering that question often hinges on the definition of artificial intelligence but it might make more sense instead to focus on defining what we mean by “smart”in the 1950s the psychologist j p guilford divided creative thought into two categories convergent thinking and divergent thinking convergent thinking which guilford defined as the ability to answer questions correctly is predominantly a display of memory and logic divergent thinking the ability to generate many potential answers from a single problem or question shows a flair for curiosity an ability to think “outside the box” it’s the difference between remembering the capital of austria and figuring how to start a thriving business in vienna without knowing a lick of germanwhen most people think of ai’s relative strengths over humans they think of its convergent intelligence with superior memory capacity and processing power computers outperform people at rulesbased games complex calculations and data storage chess advanced math and jeopardy what computers lack some might say is any form of imagination or rulebreaking curiosity—that is divergencebut what if that common view is wrong what if ai’s real comparative advantage over humans is precisely its divergent intelligence—its creative potential that’s the subject of the latest episode of the podcast crazygenius produced by kasia mychajlowycz and patricia yacobone of the more interesting applications of ai today is a field called generative design where a machine is fed oodles of data and asked to come up with hundreds or thousands of designs that meet specific criteria it is essentially an exercise in divergent potentialfor example when the architecturesoftware firm autodesk wanted to design a new office it asked its employees what they wanted from the ideal workplace how much light or privacy or open space programmers entered these survey responses into the ai and the generativedesign technology produced more than 10000 different blueprints then human architects took their favorite details from these computergenerated designs to build the world’s first largescale office created using ai“generative design is like working with an allpowerful really painfully stupid genie” said astro teller the head of x the secret research lab at google’s parent company alphabet that is it can be both magical and mindnumbingly overliteral so i asked teller where companies could use this painfully dense genie “everywhere” he said most importantly generative design could help biologists simulate the effect of new drugs without putting sick humans at risk by testing thousands of variations of a new medicine in a biological simulator we could one day design drugs the way we design commercial airplanes—by exhaustively testing their specifications before we put them in the air with several hundred passengersai’s divergent potential is one of the hottest subjects in the field this spring several dozen computer scientists published an unusual paper on the history of ai this paper was not a work of research it was a collection of stories—some ominous some hilarious—that showed ai shocking its own designers with its ingenuity most of the stories involved a kind of ai called machine learning where programmers give the computer data and a problem to solve without explicit instructions in the hopes that the algorithm will figure out how to answer itfirst an ominous example one algorithm was supposed to figure out how to land a virtual airplane with minimal force but the ai soon discovered that if it crashed the plane the program would register a force so large that it would overwhelm its own memory and count it as a perfect score so the ai crashed the plane over and over again presumably killing all the virtual people on board this is the sort of nefarious ruleshacking that makes ai alarmists fear that a sentient ai could ultimately destroy mankind to be clear there is a cavernous gap between a simulator snafu and skynetbut the benign examples were just as interesting in one test of locomotion a simulated robot was programmed to travel forward as quickly as possible but instead of building legs and walking it built itself into a tall tower and fell forward how is growing tall and falling on your face anything like walking well both cover a horizontal distance pretty quickly and the ai took its task very very literallyaccording to janelle shane a research scientist who publishes a website about artificial intelligence there is an eerie genius to this forwardfalling strategy “after i had posted this paper online i heard from some biologists who said ‘oh yeah wheat uses this strategy to propagate’” she told me “at the end of each season these tall stalks of wheat fall over and their seeds land just a little bit farther from where the wheat stalk heads started”from the perspective of the computer programmer the ai failed to walk but from the perspective of the ai it rapidly mutated in a simulated environment to discover something which had taken wheat stalks millions of years to learn why walk when you can just fall a relatable sentimentthe stories in this paper are not just evidence of the dimwittedness of artificial intelligence in fact they are evidence of the opposite a divergent intelligence that mimics biology “these anecdotes thus serve as evidence that evolution whether biological or computational is inherently creative and should routinely be expected to surprise delight and even outwit us” the lead authors write in the conclusion sometimes a machine is more clever than its makersthis is not to say that ai displays what psychologists would call human creativity these machines cannot turn themselves on or become selfmotivated or ask alternate questions or even explain their discoveries without consciousness or comprehension a creature cannot be truly creativebut if ai and machine learning in particular does not think as a person does perhaps it’s more accurate to say it evolves as an organism can consider the familiar twostep of evolution with mutation genes diverge from their preexisting structure with natural selection organisms converge on the mutation best adapted to their environment thus evolutionary biology displays a divergent and convergent intelligence that is a far better metaphor for to the process of machine learning like generative design than the tangle of human thoughtai might not be “smart” in a human sense of the word but it has already shown that it can perform an eerie simulation of evolution and that is a spooky kind of geniuswe want to hear what you think about

arent uniformly positiveduring a wideranging reddit ask me anything session one that touched upon everything from his biggest regrets to his favorite spread to lather on bread the microsoft cofounder and billionaire philanthropist outlined a future that is equal parts promising and ominousmidway through the discussion on wednesday gates was asked what personal computing will look like in 2045 gates responded by asserting that the next 30 years will be a time of rapid progresseven in the next 10 problems like vision and speech understanding and translation will be very good he wrote mechanical robot tasks like picking fruit or moving a hospital patient will be solved once computersrobots get to a level of capability where seeing and moving is easy for them then they will be used very extensivelyhe went on to highlight a microsoft project known as the personal agent which is being designed to help people manage their memory attention and focus the idea that you have to find applications and pick them and they each are trying to tell you what is new is just not the efficient model the agent will help solve this he said it will work across all your devicesthe response from reddit users was mixed with some making light of gatess revelation clippy 20 wrote one user and others sounding the alarmthis technology you are developing sounds at its essence like the centralization of knowledge intake a redditor wrote ergo whomever controls this will control what information people make their own even today we see the daily consequences of people who live in an environment that essentially tunnelvisions their knowledgeshortly after gates was asked how much of an existential threat superintelligent machines pose to humansthe question has been at the forefront of several recent discussions among prominent futurists last month theoretical physicist stephen hawking said artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human racewhy the world’s most intelligent people shouldn’t be so afraid of artificial intelligencespeaking at the mit aeronautics and astronautics department’s centennial symposium in october tesla boss elon musk referred to artificial intelligence as summoning the demoni think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence if i were to guess like what our biggest existential threat is it’s probably that so we need to be very careful with the artificial intelligence increasingly scientists think there should be some regulatory oversight maybe at the national and international level just to make sure that we don’t do something very foolish with artificial intelligence we are summoning the demon in all those stories where there’s the guy with the pentagram and the holy water it’s like yeah he’s sure he can control the demon didnt work outbritish inventor clive sinclair has said he thinks artificial intelligence will doom mankindonce you start to make machines that are rivaling and surpassing humans with intelligence its going to be very difficult for us to survive he told the bbc its just an inevitabilityafter gushing about the immediate future of technology in his reddit ama gates aligned himself with the ai alarmsoundersi am in the camp that is concerned about super intelligence gates wrote first the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent that should be positive if we manage it well a few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern i agree with elon musk and some others on this and dont understand why some people are not concernedonce he finished addressing the potential demise of humankind gates got back to answering more immediate less serious questions like revealing his favorite spread to put on breadbutter peanut butter cheese spread he wrote any of thesethe microsoft cofounders comments on ai came shortly after the managing director of microsoft researchs redmond lab said the doomsday declarations about the threat to human life are overblownthere have been concerns about the longterm prospect that we lose control of certain kinds of intelligences eric horvitz said according to the bbc i fundamentally dont think thats going to happen i think that we will be very proactive in terms of how we field ai systems and that in the end well be able to get incredible benefits from machine intelligence in all realms of life from science to education to economics to daily lifehorvitz noted that over a quarter of all attention and resources at microsoft research are focused on artificial intelligencethis story originally posted on wednesday has been updatedrelated elon musk stephen hawking google researchers join forces to avoid ‘pitfalls’ of artificial intelligencestephen hawking just got an artificial intelligence upgrade but still thinks ai could bring an end to mankindelon musk ‘with artificial intelligence we are summoning the demon’', 'ul': 'sections hometry 1 month for 1 username

structure into the algorithm itself to mimic the structure of the problem theres usually some amount of knowledge we already have of each domain an understanding of how it usually works but its not clear how or even if to lend this knowledge to an ai algorithm to help it get started sure it may get the algorithm caught up to where we already were on solving that problem but will it eventually become a limitation where the structure and assumptions prevent the algorithm from surpassing human performance this week well talk about the question in general and especially recommend a recent discussion between christopher manning and yann lecun two ai researchers who hold different opinions on whether structure is a necessary good or a necessary eviladd feedbackmore like this by textby

note minna proctorthe first three things that come to mind in order of importance when i hear the phrase artificial intelligence are 1 enslaved replicants in a philip k dick universe rising up against and squashing the human oppressor 2 artificial limbs—especially extremities that can be controlled remotely by some kind of brain implant 3 vacuum cleaners that sail around the house collecting dust while you are at work a cosmology of nonstop thrills with profound implications for our human stamina and quite likely our salvationhow that world of brilliance and machinery morphed into a collection of stories and poems about emotional posturing defense mechanisms protracted confessions and a surprising bouquet of j’accuse themes and variations is a mystery quite possibly the act of reading in the midst of a technological frenzy forces reinterpretation of any futuristic utopia progress isn’t speed it’s psychological acrobatics—the wherewithal to not only survive our moment of tenuous intelligence but to live and love creatively to claw at the surfaces of technologyit seems inevitable that when i think a theme is going to lead us to a lively even playful issue which is how i envisioned this issue turning out when we planned it last year we end up in the pits of despair i find this a rather despairing though exquisite issue not even jack garrett’s playful romp “happiness” warms the soul though you dear reader might remind me that the funnest part of philip k dick is his bleak blighted vision of the world and the way he hid safely from all potential minglings of man and progress behind a forcefield of crazy those vacuums that clean for themselves are preposterous extravagant and kind of loveless and that we have a greater need than ever before in human history for artificial limbs the extremities in particular because of the newfangled antipersonnel technologies of war and terrorralph baer the man who invented the electronic game simon on our cover is known as the father of the video game in addition to simon which was launched at studio 54 disco dystopia in 1978 he invented the prototype for the joystick known as the brown box—a multiplayer multiprogram video game system one of the 1967 prototypes that you can see in the archives of the national museum of american history has a shotgun wired to the little brown melamine control the punch plastic homemade label on that iteration is called “target practice” i mention it because it is striking—and because drones more advances in artificial intelligence belong in the category of newfangled war games and because video games for better or worse are the bridge between gadget and cultural watershed i played simon for hours when i was eight it may have been one of my all time favorite christmas presents i love it as a symbol for this issue because it embodies the ifthen algorithm of primitive computer language as well as the mindless seduction of repeatafterme and the blinking lights and primary colors that represent the eternal hope of childrens toys simon is a perfect expression of futurism for our moment redredyellowredbluegreenblueblue faster and faster bleeping and blinking into

× ÷ ± √ σ ≠ ≥ ≤ π δ χ ▶ ֿ¹ ² ³ l₁ l₂ l₃ l₄ l₅ l₆ ≅ ℕ º θ ∠ ∞ ♦ ⇧ ∫ ∏ ©artificial intelligence often abbreviated ai is a branch of computer science concerning the intelligence of machines more specifically artificial intelligence is the ability of inorganic automaton to perceive their environment and make rational decisions based on data acquired used in applications with dynamic environments as opposed to static ai attempts to provide solutions to problems without the need of human interaction the entire purpose behind utilizing ai is to allow automata to make decisions as if it were human in essence ai is an effort to emulate the human mind in settings where a real human would be impossible or impracticable to usein the game industry ai allows a cpu to compete against a human player or another cpu under the rules governing the game for example a chess ai will analyze the game and attempt to make moves which will maximize its success other examples of ai include speech recognition used in cell phones automatic thermostat controls and the navigation system used in autonomous robotic vacuum cleaners in each of these applications ai combines multiple elements together to complete a task based on the data presented breaking the ai into individual qualities allows these elements to be characterizedin order for a system to be considered artificially intelligent it must exhibit at least three established characteristics these characteristics are referred to as the “three a’s” acquire analyze actionan ai system has the ability to make observations about its environment whether the observations are physical or purely numerical they represent data acquired by the aian ai system has the ability to evaluate the data acquired and arrive at a conclusion a chess ai will analyze board piece locations to determine a set of possible actions which will maximize its probability of winning the gamean ai system has the ability to make rational choices based on the conclusion of the analysis this characteristic is especially important as it represents the ai’s function as an agent in other words the ai has the ability to choose its course of action doing so in a rational mannerthe three a’s were specifically chosen in order to differentiate true ai from what is otherwise an automated entity performing a predetermined set of tasks industrial robots may appear to have ai however they are simply machines following programmed instructions they do not have the ability to acquire nor analyze environmental data another misleading use of the word ai is toward game opponents often game opponents that give the impression of being artificially intelligent are nothing more than controlled systems abiding by a set of rules according to the current situation an example would include goombas and koopa troopas commonly found throughout many mario series they do not have ai since they do not possess the defining characteristic of action in other words they do not have the ability to make choices although goombas and industrial robots do not have ai this doesn’t mean that they could not utilize aifor example the industrial robot could be equipped with a humidistat and sound level meter in order to collect data about environmental humidity and decibel levels respectively the robot could then analyze the information and make decisions based on the results of the analysis a possible action may be to activate evaporation fans if the humidity rises above a certain level or to reduce operation speed if the environment decibel levels exceed regulation while less independent as may be associated with ai the industrial robot in this proposed setting abides by the rules established for characterizing artificial intelligence the robot has the ability to acquire analyze and take action based on environmental data making rational decisions towards achieving a goaldeveloping artificial intelligence involves critical thinking and requires an interrogative approach towards its application it is often necessary to analyze human thought patterns when designing an ai the process through which an individual arrives at a conclusion in a game of checkers is likely similar to the sequence of steps an ai should take to maximize competency thus to better understand artificial intelligence it is worthwhile to consider the entity from which it is being modeled the human brainwith estimated 50100 billon neurons and approximately 100 trillion synaptic connections linking the neurons the human brain is arguably the most powerful computer in existencein order to take action based on what it analyzes an ai must use logical and conditional statements pertaining to the operation it has been programmed to do for example in a game of tic tac toe the ai must be able to use logic statements to determine where to place the next x or o in order to either block its opponent or complete a 3inarow for itself logic statements can also be used to put certain actions at a higher priority than others for example a tic tac toe ai will attempt to complete its own 3inarow before blocking the opponent because if it has already won then the game is over and there is no chance of the opponent winningto program an ai you must think like one you must not think like you would because if you were making the move in tic tac toe you would reason on which move would be better but the calculator cant do this all it can do is execute your code and make choices depending on whats true at the time and what your code tells it to doconditionals are programming objects that check if an event is true and run a section of code if it is in ti basic the most applicable conditional for ai is if and less common while repeat for is and ds conditionals are the easiest way to reach an action from input information it represents analyze of the three asin a game that contains random elements as a mechanic such as dice cards and spinners a good ai must account for them in a logical manner one way to implement this would be to do a weighted average of all the possible options based on the likelihood of each outcome and a calculable value for how well the game is goingthere are many methods that an ai can use to calculate a move each with their own strengths and weaknesses these are some of the most popularminimaxing is a method of ai in which each possible move is plotted on a tree the computer finds the most achievable end state and takes moves to reach that state note that the end state does not have to be the best possible state for example a minimax tic tac toe ai wont try to attempt 3 in a row assuming that its opponent wont try to stop it instead a minimax ai assumes that its opponent will make the best possible moves and then find moves that lead to the worst possible best moves in other words the minimum maximum minimaxing is suited for ai that should play perfectly and thus might not be a good fit for a fun game opponent this approach works best for smaller shorter games like tic tac toe where there arent too many moves to plot and the number of possible moves decreases over time minimaxing in a game such as chess is much more difficult due to there being an increasing large number of moves so much so that such an endeavor is currently infeasible minimaxing also doesnt work well for realtime games where each turn happens every interactable framethe decision tree ai is the most common and the most applicable ai in video games and is also the easiest to implement on a graphing calculator a decision trees foundation is the conditional the programmer codes in certain events has the computer check if those events are true and then has it run code if it is true for the game tic tac toe the programmer might have the computer check if it has a 2 in a row on the board if so then they will have it choose the 3rd empty tile this approach to ai is the best suited for games due to its logical predictable and easy to implement system of conditionals because of the decision trees simple nature it is by far the best choice for ti basicfirst of all letting a calculator learn is not really possible however it is possible to let it remember and compare thus creating the illusion it has learned lets see an example tic tac toe in this game it could be possible for the program to store all the games it played in lists whenever the program cant figure a good move using the normal routine it can refer back to the lists and compare the list with the actual situation now if the situation matches it could give a good move based on what it did good or bad in the list it is comparing to this way of learning would prevent the human player from applying the same tactic over and over again ergo the machine seems to have learned what to do when this tactic appears a good example of self learning is deep blue this was a machine developed by ibm that won a deciding chess game against the best human chess player at that timework in progress', 'ul': 'membership rules and code of conduct site members become a member invite a friend editing pages guide to editing wiki

defaultdict(<class 'str'>, {'title': 'feature libraries in the age of artificial intelligence', 'h3': 'accessinformation literacypersonal privacyintellectual freedomworkplayconclusion', 'p': 'magazines computers in libraries januaryfebruary 2018now in the 21st century a new quasimagical thing has come into our lives artificial intelligence ai and just as it was in the early days of the electronic revolution we are only beginning to grasp how completely this new technology will transform our daily lives nearly all of today’s emerging technologies are built on the foundation of increasingly sophisticated machine learning every major technology company is betting on machine learning hoping to be a player in the coming revolution by developing proprietary machine intelligences to perform tasks that used to require human intelligence today our interactions with ai are mostly novel “siri why did the chicken cross the road”—and the results crude—but so were the first lightbulbs and photographsthe modern public library arose alongside the late 19thcenturyearly 20thcentury electrical revolution and has steadily adapted systems and services to new technologies ever since however ai will test the institution of librarianship as no technology has before we value libraries because they keep us informed and connected we read to enrich our lives and inform our decisions but what happens when that decisionmaking process is fundamentally changedmachines are becoming skilled at learning speaking recognizing patterns and making decisions as a result asking a machine for answers is quickly becoming a normal everyday activity as ai becomes better and better at understanding our information needs and delivering relevant answers it seems likely we will come to rely on it more over time these interactions will be less novel and more essentialafter the ai revolution we will not read a library book to get information to inform a decision why would we when a machine has already read all of the books and is more skilled at analysis and decision making we will not spend hours on library computers researching a question when ai can do it for us in seconds and we certainly won’t go to a human librarian with an information need when ai is able to deliver a better answer in a fraction of the timeright now when we seek an answer to a problem we often put data numbers search terms or whatever into software make an analysis and use the results to inform a decision this hybrid process takes place in our heads and on the computer soon it will seem very natural to just state the problem and let the computer deliver the decision the middle pieces—the input analysis and critical reasoning parts—will take place inside a black box we won’t understand how it happens and we won’t care as long as we get consistently good resultswhile libraries will certainly be changed by the ai revolution—and in ways we can’t imagine—it seems unlikely that they will cease to exist altogether indeed public libraries and public universities may yet have a critical role to play in the ai revolution today’s mainstream ais are dominated by proprietary software apple microsoft google facebook and other major tech players all have their own ais these companies have invested heavily in research and development and they have guarded their intellectual property closely the algorithms that give rise to machine learning are mostly kept secret and the code that results from machine learning is often so complex that even the human developers don’t understand exactly how their code works so even if you wanted to know what ai was thinking you would be out of luck but if ai is a black box for which we have no key public institutions can play in important role in providing open source ai solutions that allow for more transparency and more controla black box is a device that receives an input and produces an output without any knowledge of its internal workings if you ask alexa “what was the cause of the civil war” you will get a different answer than if you ask siri—and you will not know how either arrived at the answer you can never know what alexa is thinking because the thinking happens at a secure data center far awaypublic institutions can help lower the barriers to ai by producing providing and promoting open source ai projects there are currently several open source ai projects available to researchers and developers and as the technology becomes more ubiquitous practical ai systems will be available for people outside of these specialized fieldsby supporting open source ai public institutions can ensure that researchers can access powerful systems that are free from corporate bias because alexa is happy to answer your questions—and to sell you a subscription to amazon primeinformation literacy is about knowing when there is a need for information and being able to identify locate evaluate and effectively use that information for the issue at hand when ibm’s watson beat ken jennings and brad rutter at jeopardy in 2010 it knew exactly how to evaluate and effectively use information and after watching a computer absolutely own the world’s best human contestants i think it is safe to say that ai is capable of superior information literacy what’s worse recent events russian influence claims of fake news etc have illustrated just how bad humans are at assessing the accuracy of the things we readwhen ai becomes good at using information for problem solving it is possible that our dependence on ai information literacy will lead to a weakening of our own but if it is important to critically evaluate information sources it will be doubly important but considerably more difficult to evaluate our ai information providers and decision makersas we have seen in recent years minor changes to a dataset or algorithm can greatly alter our digital experiences google has been accused of favoring its own products and services over those of its competitors facebook has been accused of altering the course of an election microsoft’s chatbot tay morphed into a hitlerloving troll the popular game pokémon go kept players confined to white neighborhoods we may assume that an ai is an unbiased arbiter but an ai with biases in its dataset will output biased answersthe same critical lens of information literacy that we apply to books and articles must be applied to ai to do so we will need a much more powerful lenswe may not always realize it but we are using ai every day for example when we search google we are feeding data to rankbrain—an ai system that helps sort through search results with machine learning a computer teach\xades itself to do something rather than following detailed programmingwe don’t always understand exactly how it works but if you feed enough photos of cats into a neural net it will eventually learn to identify a cat if you give it words and phrases it can eventually learn to understand and respond and increasingly ai is performing better than humancoded algorithmic rules given that machine learning requires massive amounts of data to be effective our personal data has become a hot commodity striking deposits of deep data is the 21stcentury equivalent of striking oillibraries promote data privacy and for the most part we practice what we promote we don’t give out library records we don’t track our web users etc but we will need a new set of sophisticated tools if we are going to truly be champions of privacy rights in the coming decadesevery day our data is monetized by corporations weaponized by political players and stolen for illicit purposes if anything should concern us about the ai revolution it isn’t a sciencefiction robot apocalypse it’s how already established forms of internet mischief will be exacerbated by machine learning libraries can help secure privacy by providing anonymous ways of interacting with ai systemsif intellectual freedom is the right of every individual to seek and receive information from all points of view without restriction then that right is under attack as we come to seek and receive information from ai how will we ensure that freedom is protectedin 2016 authorities investigating the death of an arkansas man sought as evidence any comments overheard by the suspect’s amazon echo speaker in september 2017 the department of justice doj issued search warrants to facebook demanding information on accounts associated with “antiadministration” users by accessing the personal data of these users the doj would know not only about the activists but also those who read their posts who followed them and who messaged thema book can’t be called to a witness stand books don’t talk—but your ai assistant listens and talks if you asked your ai home assistant how to murder someone or if you asked it to read a post by an antigovernment activist you could potentially be producing a trail of evidence that could be used against you maybe you were writing an episode of csi maybe you were doing research for a book about the history of anarchist organizations whatever your reason for seeking that information your queries were being recorded and savedas our primary means of gaining information moves from reading printed words to interacting with machine intelligences we must ensure that the same safeguards we use to protect books are extended to ai when an ai makes controversial decisions or predictions people will almost certainly try to ban it just as they try to ban controversial booksin 2017 an outspoken critic of google was fired from a us think tank that received its funding from google but in 2025 a company will have far more sophisticated and subtle ways of altering the information landscape an ai that determines what information you see may learn to reflect the biases of its programming and devalue certain points of view if an ai is a black box that takes an inputted question and delivers an outputted answer who is to say that the output was not influenced by someone or somethingas ai comes to outperform humans in a growing number

that we apply to books and articles must be applied to ai to do so we will need a much more powerful lens you can ask google alexa cortana watson or siri—but will you be able to ask your local library a century or so ago electricity was a new quasimagical thing—a novelty with few applications back then nobody could have predicted that it would give rise to telephones production lines and microchips and yet electricity transformed every industry including agriculture healthcare transportation and manufacturing as a foundational springboard for so many new innovations that novelty was the most important engineering achievement of the 20th century now in the 21st century a new quasimagical thing has come into our lives artificial intelligence ai and just as it was in the early days of the electronic revolution we are only beginning to grasp how completely this new technology will transform our daily lives nearly all of today’s emerging technologies are built on the foundation of increasingly sophisticated machine learning every major technology company is betting on machine learning hoping to be a player in the coming revolution by developing proprietary machine intelligences to perform tasks that used to require human intelligence today our interactions with ai are mostly novel “siri why did the chicken cross the road”—and the results crude—but so were the first lightbulbs and photographs the modern public library arose alongside the late 19thcenturyearly 20thcentury electrical revolution and has steadily adapted systems and services to new technologies ever since however ai will test the institution of librarianship as no technology has before we value libraries because they keep us informed and connected we read to enrich our lives and inform our decisions but what happens when that decisionmaking process is fundamentally changed machines are becoming skilled at learning speaking recognizing patterns and making decisions as a result asking a machine for answers is quickly becoming a normal everyday activity as ai becomes better and better at understanding our information needs and delivering relevant answers it seems likely we will come to rely on it more over time these interactions will be less novel and more essential after the ai revolution we will not read a library book to get information to inform a decision why would we when a machine has already read all of the books and is more skilled at analysis and decision making we will not spend hours on library computers researching a question when ai can do it for us in seconds and we certainly won’t go to a human librarian with an information need when ai is able to deliver a better answer in a fraction of the time right now when we seek an answer to a problem we often put data numbers search terms or whatever into software make an analysis and use the results to inform a decision this hybrid process takes place in our heads and on the computer soon it will seem very natural to just state the problem and let the computer deliver the decision the middle pieces—the input analysis and critical reasoning parts—will take place inside a black box we won’t understand how it happens and we won’t care as long as we get consistently good results while libraries will certainly be changed by the ai revolution—and in ways we can’t imagine—it seems unlikely that they will cease to exist altogether indeed public libraries and public universities may yet have a critical role to play in the ai revolution today’s mainstream ais are dominated by proprietary software apple microsoft google facebook and other major tech players all have their own ais these companies have invested heavily in research and development and they have guarded their intellectual property closely the algorithms that give rise to machine learning are mostly kept secret and the code that results from machine learning is often so complex that even the human developers don’t understand exactly how their code works so even if you wanted to know what ai was thinking you would be out of luck but if ai is a black box for which we have no key public institutions can play in important role in providing open source ai solutions that allow for more transparency and more control access a black box is a device that receives an input and produces an output without any knowledge of its internal workings if you ask alexa “what was the cause of the civil war” you will get a different answer than if you ask siri—and you will not know how either arrived at the answer you can never know what alexa is thinking because the thinking happens at a secure data center far away public institutions can help lower the barriers to ai by producing providing and promoting open source ai projects there are currently several open source ai projects available to researchers and developers and as the technology becomes more ubiquitous practical ai systems will be available for people outside of these specialized fields by supporting open source ai public institutions can ensure that researchers can access powerful systems that are free from corporate bias because alexa is happy to answer your questions—and to sell you a subscription to amazon prime information literacy information literacy is about knowing when there is a need for information and being able to identify locate evaluate and effectively use that information for the issue at hand when ibm’s watson beat ken jennings and brad rutter at jeopardy in 2010 it knew exactly how to evaluate and effectively use information and after watching a computer absolutely own the world’s best human contestants i think it is safe to say that ai is capable of superior information literacy what’s worse recent events russian influence claims of fake news etc have illustrated just how bad humans are at assessing the accuracy of the things we read when ai becomes good at using information for problem solving it is possible that our dependence on ai information literacy will lead to a weakening of our own but if it is important to critically evaluate information sources it will be doubly important but considerably more difficult to evaluate our ai information providers and decision makers as we have seen in recent years minor changes to a dataset or algorithm can greatly alter our digital experiences google has been accused of favoring its own products and services over those of its competitors facebook has been accused of altering the course of an election microsoft’s chatbot tay morphed into a hitlerloving troll the popular game pokémon go kept players confined to white neighborhoods we may assume that an ai is an unbiased arbiter but an ai with biases in its dataset will output biased answers the same critical lens of information literacy that we apply to books and articles must be applied to ai to do so we will need a much more powerful lens personal privacy we may not always realize it but we are using ai every day for example when we search google we are feeding data to rankbrain—an ai system that helps sort through search results with machine learning a computer teach\xades itself to do something rather than following detailed programming we don’t always understand exactly how it works but if you feed enough photos of cats into a neural net it will eventually learn to identify a cat if you give it words and phrases it can eventually learn to understand and respond and increasingly ai is performing better than humancoded algorithmic rules given that machine learning requires massive amounts of data to be effective our personal data has become a hot commodity striking deposits of deep data is the 21stcentury equivalent of striking oil libraries promote data privacy and for the most part we practice what we promote we don’t give out library records we don’t track our web users etc but we will need a new set of sophisticated tools if we are going to truly be champions of privacy rights in the coming decades every day our data is monetized by corporations weaponized by political players and stolen for illicit purposes if anything should concern us about the ai revolution it isn’t a sciencefiction robot apocalypse it’s how already established forms of internet mischief will be exacerbated by machine learning libraries can help secure privacy by providing anonymous ways of interacting with ai systems intellectual freedom if intellectual freedom is the right of every individual to seek and receive information from all points of view without restriction then that right is under attack as we come to seek and receive information from ai how will we ensure that freedom is protected in 2016 authorities investigating the death of an arkansas man sought as evidence any comments overheard by the suspect’s amazon echo speaker in september 2017 the department of justice doj issued search warrants to facebook demanding information on accounts associated with “antiadministration” users by accessing the personal data of these users the doj would know not only about the activists but also those who read their posts who followed them and who messaged them a book can’t be called to a witness stand books don’t talk—but your ai assistant listens and talks if you asked your ai home assistant how to murder someone or if you asked it to read a post by an antigovernment activist you could potentially be producing a trail of evidence that could be used against you maybe you were writing an episode of csi maybe you were doing research for a book about the history of anarchist organizations whatever your reason for seeking that information your queries were being recorded and saved as our primary means of gaining information moves from reading printed words to interacting with machine intelligences we must ensure that the same safeguards we use to protect books are extended to ai when an ai makes controversial decisions or predictions people will almost certainly try to ban it just as they try to ban controversial books in 2017 an outspoken critic of google was fired from a us think tank that received its funding from google but in 2025 a company will have far more sophisticated and subtle ways of altering the information landscape an ai that determines what information you see may learn to reflect the biases of its programming and devalue certain points of view if an ai is a black box that takes an inputted question and delivers an outputted answer who is to say that the output was not influenced by someone or something work as ai comes to outperform humans in a growing number of tasks it will come to replace humans in a growing number of jobs and as ai grows more sophisticated it will become harder and harder to invent new jobs jobs that humans can perform better than machines eventually these same algorithms that took our jobs may come up with a solution for feeding and housing us but in the short term we will be left to deal with a growing number of unemployable people taxi drivers are watching wearily as fleets of selfdriving cars descend on singapore cashiers in iowa watch as their workstations are

vol 38 no 1 — janfeb 2018 feature libraries in the age of artificial intelligence by ben johnson the same critical lens of information literacy that we apply to books and articles must be applied to ai to do so we will need a much more powerful lens you can ask google alexa cortana watson or siri—but will you be able to ask your local library a century or so ago electricity was a new quasimagical thing—a novelty with few applications back then nobody could have predicted that it would give rise to telephones production lines and microchips and yet electricity transformed every industry including agriculture healthcare transportation and manufacturing as a foundational springboard for so many new innovations that novelty was the most important engineering achievement of the 20th century now in the 21st century a new quasimagical thing has come into our lives artificial intelligence ai and just as it was in the early days of the electronic revolution we are only beginning to grasp how completely this new technology will transform our daily lives nearly all of today’s emerging technologies are built on the foundation of increasingly sophisticated machine learning every major technology company is betting on machine learning hoping to be a player in the coming revolution by developing proprietary machine intelligences to perform tasks that used to require human intelligence today our interactions with ai are mostly novel “siri why did the chicken cross the road”—and the results crude—but so were the first lightbulbs and photographs the modern public library arose alongside the late 19thcenturyearly 20thcentury electrical revolution and has steadily adapted systems and services to new technologies ever since however ai will test the institution of librarianship as no technology has before we value libraries because they keep us informed and connected we read to enrich our lives and inform our decisions but what happens when that decisionmaking process is fundamentally changed machines are becoming skilled at learning speaking recognizing patterns and making decisions as a result asking a machine for answers is quickly becoming a normal everyday activity as ai becomes better and better at understanding our information needs and delivering relevant answers it seems likely we will come to rely on it more over time these interactions will be less novel and more essential after the ai revolution we will not read a library book to get information to inform a decision why would we when a machine has already read all of the books and is more skilled at analysis and decision making we will not spend hours on library computers researching a question when ai can do it for us in seconds and we certainly won’t go to a human librarian with an information need when ai is able to deliver a better answer in a fraction of the time right now when we seek an answer to a problem we often put data numbers search terms or whatever into software make an analysis and use the results to inform a decision this hybrid process takes place in our heads and on the computer soon it will seem very natural to just state the problem and let the computer deliver the decision the middle pieces—the input analysis and critical reasoning parts—will take place inside a black box we won’t understand how it happens and we won’t care as long as we get consistently good results while libraries will certainly be changed by the ai revolution—and in ways we can’t imagine—it seems unlikely that they will cease to exist altogether indeed public libraries and public universities may yet have a critical role to play in the ai revolution today’s mainstream ais are dominated by proprietary software apple microsoft google facebook and other major tech players all have their own ais these companies have invested heavily in research and development and they have guarded their intellectual property closely the algorithms that give rise to machine learning are mostly kept secret and the code that results from machine learning is often so complex that even the human developers don’t understand exactly how their code works so even if you wanted to know what ai was thinking you would be out of luck but if ai is a black box for which we have no key public institutions can play in important role in providing open source ai solutions that allow for more transparency and more control access a black box is a device that receives an input and produces an output without any knowledge of its internal workings if you ask alexa “what was the cause of the civil war” you will get a different answer than if you ask siri—and you will not know how either arrived at the answer you can never know what alexa is thinking because the thinking happens at a secure data center far away public institutions can help lower the barriers to ai by producing providing and promoting open source ai projects there are currently several open source ai projects available to researchers and developers and as the technology becomes more ubiquitous practical ai systems will be available for people outside of these specialized fields by supporting open source ai public institutions can ensure that researchers can access powerful systems that are free from corporate bias because alexa is happy to answer your questions—and to sell you a subscription to amazon prime information literacy information literacy is about knowing when there is a need for information and being able to identify locate evaluate and effectively use that information for the issue at hand when ibm’s watson beat ken jennings and brad rutter at jeopardy in 2010 it knew exactly how to evaluate and effectively use information and after watching a computer absolutely own the world’s best human contestants i think it is safe to say that ai is capable of superior information literacy what’s worse recent events russian influence claims of fake news etc have illustrated just how bad humans are at assessing the accuracy of the things we read when ai becomes good at using information for problem solving it is possible that our dependence on ai information literacy will lead to a weakening of our own but if it is important to critically evaluate information sources it will be doubly important but considerably more difficult to evaluate our ai information providers and decision makers as we have seen in recent years minor changes to a dataset or algorithm can greatly alter our digital experiences google has been accused of favoring its own products and services over those of its competitors facebook has been accused of altering the course of an election microsoft’s chatbot tay morphed into a hitlerloving troll the popular game pokémon go kept players confined to white neighborhoods we may assume that an ai is an unbiased arbiter but an ai with biases in its dataset will output biased answers the same critical lens of information literacy that we apply to books and articles must be applied to ai to do so we will need a much more powerful lens personal privacy we may not always realize it but we are using ai every day for example when we search google we are feeding data to rankbrain—an ai system that helps sort through search results with machine learning a computer teach\xades itself to do something rather than following detailed programming we don’t always understand exactly how it works but if you feed enough photos of cats into a neural net it will eventually learn to identify a cat if you give it words and phrases it can eventually learn to understand and respond and increasingly ai is performing better than humancoded algorithmic rules given that machine learning requires massive amounts of data to be effective our personal data has become a hot commodity striking deposits of deep data is the 21stcentury equivalent of striking oil libraries promote data privacy and for the most part we practice what we promote we don’t give out library records we don’t track our web users etc but we will need a new set of sophisticated tools if we are going to truly be champions of privacy rights in the coming decades every day our data is monetized by corporations weaponized by political players and stolen for illicit purposes if anything should concern us about the ai revolution it isn’t a sciencefiction robot apocalypse it’s how already established forms of internet mischief will be exacerbated by machine learning libraries can help secure privacy by providing anonymous ways of interacting with ai systems intellectual freedom if intellectual freedom is the right of every individual to seek and receive information from all points of view without restriction then that right is under attack as we come to seek and receive information from ai how will we ensure that freedom is protected in 2016 authorities investigating the death of an arkansas man sought as evidence any comments overheard by the suspect’s amazon echo speaker in september 2017 the department of justice doj issued search warrants to facebook demanding information on accounts associated with “antiadministration” users by accessing the personal data of these users the doj would know not only about the activists but also those who read their posts who followed them and who messaged them a book can’t be called to a witness stand books don’t talk—but your ai assistant listens and talks if you asked your ai home assistant how to murder someone or if you asked it to read a post by an antigovernment activist you could potentially be producing a trail of evidence that could be used against you maybe you were writing an episode of csi maybe you were doing research for a book about the history of anarchist organizations whatever your reason for seeking that information your queries were being recorded and saved as our primary means of gaining information moves from reading printed words to interacting with machine intelligences we must ensure that the same safeguards we use to protect books are extended to ai when an ai makes controversial decisions or predictions people will almost certainly try to ban it just as they try to ban controversial books in 2017 an outspoken critic of google was fired from a us think tank that received its funding from google but in 2025 a company will have far more sophisticated and subtle ways of altering the information landscape an ai that determines what information you see may learn to reflect the biases of its programming and devalue certain points of view if an ai is a black box that takes an inputted question and delivers an outputted answer who is to say that the output was not influenced by someone or something work as ai comes to outperform humans in a growing number of tasks it will come to replace humans in a growing number of jobs and as ai grows more sophisticated it will become harder and harder to invent new jobs jobs that humans can perform better than machines eventually these same algorithms that took our jobs may come up with a solution for feeding and housing us but in the short term we will be left to deal with a growing number of

malignant or benign it studies dna in the blood detecting biological signs of cancer and then making predictions about where the cancer is and what kind of treatments would work bestthe company has performed thousands of tests and is working on detecting prostate breast colon and lung cancers thanks to machine learning its software becomes better at screening over time before it can do much else freenome must complete the clinical trials necessary to secure regulatory approval and roll out to the public the startup closed a 72 million series a round last year to accomplish those goalsagriculture might look a lot different in the futurejust ask bowery farming a vertical farming startup that grows its crops indoors sensors at each facility collect data points regarding factors like humidity temperature and light cameras observe minor changes as the plants grow and thanks to machine vision the companys ai can quickly determine and adjust to the ideal conditions for a particular batchthus optimizing for yield as well as taste texture and color by output the company claims a bowery farm is more than 100 times more efficient per square foot than a traditional farm the startup is entering a space currently occupied by companies like aerofarms which takes less of an aifocused approach but already has several large vertical farms throughout the northeastern us bowery emerged from stealth and announced a 20 million funding round in 2017 its products which dont require any pesticides or chemicals are already in stores like whole foods with more likely to followexamining mri scans is tedious work and prone to human error arterys is leading the charge on handing that task over to artificial intelligence thanks to this startups tech diagnoses that usually take humans 45 minutes can now be performed in 15 seconds its system uses deep learning to compare new mri scans with those its already examined all the information is stored in a central cloud which gives the system an evergrowing data set and allows it to deliver more accurate readings over time in 2017 arteryss cardiac mri technology which examines the heart and blood flow through its ventricles became the first cloudbased ai platform to be fdaapproved for use in clinical settings the company which also closed a 30 million series b last year is currently working on getting clearance for similar technology that focuses on the lungs and liverthis startups ai aims to know more about your company than you do not sure what hrs policy is when it comes to sick day rollovers ask its chatbot theres a light out in the conference room let it know and it will direct a request to the right person spoke can answer employee inquiries via an app in slack or by way of email or text with the idea being that it will save your employees the time theyd normally spend asking questions or fielding them and keep your office running smoothly the systems machine learning component allows it to process and learn information as it converses with people storing away new answers for the futurefounded in 2016 by three exgooglers the startup closed a 20 million round in november its begun collecting clients and its product is set to launch in early 2018 potentially making the average workday that much smoother for businesses everywhere it will be up against other workplace productivity tools including slack itself which is building its own fleet of inquiryanswering chatbotscorrection an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the capabilities of freenomes liquid biopsy tests the tests are designed to detect biological signs of cancer not mutations freenome has performed thousands of tests and is still working on additional testing methods for different types of cancers the company raised a 72 million a round last year'})

exposed to more and more data it can see connections in the information that allow it to develop more precise predictive models without needing explicit instructions from the programmer the models are continually tweaked as more data comes in providing better predictionsa great example of machine learning at work is in photoshop imagine you are editing a photo of a city skyline and you want to remove an airplane in the sky photoshop using machine learning to understand the image data can enable you to select the airplane remove it and seamlessly fill in the space with perfectlymatching sky âjust as there are subsets of ai there are different kinds of machine learning one example is artificial neural networks â\x80\x94 a way of processing information that was inspired by the way the human brain works the brain uses a large number of neurons working in unison to solve complex problems an artificial neural network takes a similar approach solving problems by using a large number of interconnected processing elementswhile this is admittedly a highly complex process â jon brandt director at adobe research says the underlying principle is fairly simple in terms of the computer learning from data to find better solutions he gives the example of a data model that identifies faces in photographs so they can be automatically taggeda computer programmer developing such a model might assume the best way to recognize a face in a photo is to measure the distance between the eyes and other facial features inherently the resulting data model might revolve around that assumption but what if there were a better method the programmer never consideredbecause neural networks and machine learning arenâ\x80\x99t restricted by the programmerâ\x80\x99s explicit instructions they can analyze data in a different way and come up with insights that arenâ\x80\x99t obvious or expected the neural network can find correlations in data that the human programmer never imagined â\x80\x94 resulting in better ways to tag photoswhile the subtleties of the different ai machine learning and neural network approaches can be difficult to grasp if you arenâ\x80\x99t a computer programmer itâ\x80\x99s important to remember that ai and machine learning are simply ways of doing mathematical calculationseach step in the evolution of ai shares a similar characteristic it provides better answers and doesnâ\x80\x99t require computer programmers and end users to understand whatâ\x80\x99s going on under the hood or to do the repetitive tasks that are necessary to generate the best resultsai and machine learning has matured thanks to a combination of more robust computing power and available data â\x80\x94 and this will help many companies effectively apply it to the needs of their business ai capabilities can reduce the amount of time spent on repetitive timeconsuming tasksstill even though ai and machine learning are being used today for many important purposes â\x80\x94 from fraud detection to product recommendations â\x80\x94 the technology is still in its early stages and while the promise of ai is tantalizing there are still limitations and issues that need to be addressed before that promise is fully realizedfor example jon says that we have become so accustomed to asking our phones a question and receiving an answer that we take the act of speaking to a computer for granted in reality the current interactions are relatively simple having a computer understand verbal directions about how you want a photograph altered and then handling that task with the skill of a human assistant is much more daunting but that is the ultimate goal of ai to liberate creatives marketers business leaders and others from the tedious aspects of using technologyin addition to the technical challenges involved with ai the societal implications of the greater use of ai are being widely debated â since ai is fueled by using more data and different kinds of data we must be sure that the data is protected and used in responsible wayson a personal level people are curious about what will happen to their jobs when ai reaches its full potential jon understands that concern but he believes ai will not replace people so much as handle some of the menial tasks they must do so they can concentrate on more important thingsâ\x80\x9cwhen a new technology is introduced like cameras digital imaging or even the printing press the historic pattern has been for the technology to become yet another paintbrush for human creative expressionâ\x80\x9d jon saysthe question then is what is required for ai to reach its full potential jon says itâ\x80\x99ll take a multidisciplinaryspanning collaborative vision language specialists cognitive scientists humancomputer interaction and the creatives themselves to address this challengeâ\x80\x9cpart of what i am describing is interdisciplinaryâ\x80\x9d jon says â\x80\x9cit takes a diverse set of skills and people coming together and part of that is really solving the language problem which is how we can robustly understand both the intent and the content of the messageâ\x80\x9dstill jon sees ai becoming an integral part of the way we work live and createâ\x80\x9cultimately you can think of ai as being the pinnacle of humancomputer interaction in that it mediates all of our interactions with

arrive at more relevant if not most important resultshow can seo professionals survive in this tricky environmenthere are five strategies that you need to followadopt the power of 3g’s when it comes to keyword research 3g stands foryou can start by gathering keyword data from a keyword tool such as moz it automatically shows grouped keywords based on your main target keywordthe next step is to create exemplars which are keywords that have the highest potential of representing similar keyword phrases for example instead of creating five different landing pages for keywords likeyou create just one pillar page based on the exemplar keyword like “cheap apartments in seattle” that has the power to rank on google for all similar search queriesmoreover it is always recommended to check the searches related to the section on google serp for identifying keyword phrases that you should be optimizing forhow about feeding all your goals into the computer and let the software generate a design that complements your users well this is what we can achieve with generative designwe use this concept under cluster analysis and predictive analyticsseos should use techniques like cluster analysis to create topic clusters which simply means auditing your current pages and grouping them into topics this not only helps to improve the pagerank distribution but also helps the search engines to identify pages based on a certain topicthe structure is based on the main pillar content and nodes of subcontent that all links to the main pillar content this gives search engines a clear signal that the pillar content has more authority on the given topic allowing it to rank higher in the search resultsyou need to forecast the peak search demand for target keywords tools like google trends gives us data that looked backward but predictive analytics has the power to look into the future and identify the search trends that will help to improve saleswith proper forecasting a marketing manager should be able tomarketers have loads of data in the form of text images video and audio files user reviews play an important role in it reviews written by people use real language that people might also want to ask googlefor example a review left by a customer might say “this place has amazing seafood at an affordable price” this sentence will help google analyze and return the business in the search results when people search with a query such as “the best seafood restaurant on a budget”seo pros should capitalize on this power to gain lots of positive reviews for the businessthe first requisite is having a complete and optimized google my business listing the business should be visible on google local in order to get in front of as many customers as possible google maps marketing is a necessary component in enhancing local visibilityuser reviews enable businesses to rank higher on google for lots of newer search queries where google considers the business to be relevant based on review text left by the usersnowadays marketers have loads of data but fewer direct recommendations based on the data it would be great if you can get a comprehensive view of

mccarthy', 'p': 'skip to contentwhat exactly is “artificial intelligence” ai stanford university professor of computer science dr john mccarthy a pioneer in ai answers this question in depth for beginnersoriginally published april 4 2000 as an academic paper stanford university published on kurzweilainet february 22 2001this article for the layman answers basic questions about artificial intelligence the opinions expressed here are not all consensus opinion among researchers in aiextinguished philosophies lie about the cradle of every science as the strangled snakes beside that of hercules–adapted from t h huxleyq what is artificial intelligencea it is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines especially intelligent computer programs it is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence but ai does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observableq yes but what is intelligencea intelligence is the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world varying kinds and degrees of intelligence occur in people many animals and some machinesq isn’t there a solid definition of intelligence that doesn’t depend on relating it to human intelligencea not yet the problem is that we cannot yet characterize in general what kinds of computational procedures we want to call intelligent we understand some of the mechanisms of intelligence and not othersq is intelligence a single thing so that one can ask a yes or no question “is this machine intelligent or not”a no intelligence involves mechanisms and ai research has discovered how to make computers carry out some of them and not others if doing a task requires only mechanisms that are well understood today computer programs can give very impressive performances on these tasks such programs should be considered “somewhat intelligent”q isn’t ai about simulating human intelligencea sometimes but not always or even usually on the one hand we can learn something about how to make machines solve problems by observing other people or just by observing our own methods on the other hand most work in ai involves studying the problems the world presents to intelligence rather than studying people or animals ai researchers are free to use methods that are not observed in people or that involve much more computing than people can doq what about iq do computer programs have iqsa no iq is based on the rates at which intelligence develops in children it is the ratio of the age at which a child normally makes a certain score to the child’s age the scale is extended to adults in a suitable way iq correlates well with various measures of success or failure in life but making computers that can score high on iq tests would be weakly correlated with their usefulness for example the ability of a child to repeat back a long sequence of digits correlates well with other intellectual abilities perhaps because it measures how much information the child can compute with at once however “digit span” is trivial for even extremely limited computershowever some of the problems on iq tests are useful challenges for aiq what about other comparisons between human and computer intelligencearthur r jensen jen98 a leading researcher in human intelligence suggests “as a heuristic hypothesis” that all normal humans have the same intellectual mechanisms and that differences in intelligence are related to “quantitative biochemical and physiological conditions” i see them as speed short term memory and the ability to form accurate and retrievable long term memorieswhether or not jensen is right about human intelligence the situation in ai today is the reversecomputer programs have plenty of speed and memory but their abilities correspond to the intellectual mechanisms that program designers understand well enough to put in programs some abilities that children normally don’t develop till they are teenagers may be in and some abilities possessed by two year olds are still out the matter is further complicated by the fact that the cognitive sciences still have not succeeded in determining exactly what the human abilities are very likely the organization of the intellectual mechanisms for ai can usefully be different from that in peoplewhenever people do better than computers on some task or computers use a lot of computation to do as well as people this demonstrates that the program designers lack understanding of the intellectual mechanisms required to do the task efficientlyq when did ai research starta after wwii a number of people independently started to work on intelligent machines the english mathematician alan turing may have been the first he gave a lecture on it in 1947 he also may have been the first to decide that ai was best researched by programming computers rather than by building machines by the late 1950s there were many researchers on ai and most of them were basing their work on programming computersq does ai aim to put the human mind into the computera some researchers say they have that objective but maybe they are using the phrase metaphorically the human mind has a lot of peculiarities and i’m not sure anyone is serious about imitating all of themq what is the turing testa alan turing’s 1950 article computing machinery and intelligence tur50 discussed conditions for considering a machine to be intelligent he argued that if the machine could successfully pretend to be human to a knowledgeable observer then you certainly should consider it intelligent this test would satisfy most people but not all philosophers the observer could interact with the machine and a human by teletype to avoid requiring that the machine imitate the appearance or voice of the person and the human would try to persuade the observer that it was human and the machine would try to fool the observerthe turing test is a onesided test a machine that passes the test should certainly be considered intelligent but a machine could still be considered intelligent without knowing enough about humans to imitate a humandaniel dennett’s book brainchildren den98 has an excellent discussion of the turing test and the various partial turing tests that have been implemented ie with restrictions on the observer’s knowledge of ai and the subject matter of questioning it turns out that some people are easily led into believing that a rather dumb program is intelligentq does ai aim at humanlevel intelligencea yes the ultimate effort is to make computer programs that can solve problems and achieve goals in the world as well as humans however many people involved in particular research areas are much less ambitiousq how far is ai from reaching humanlevel intelligence when will it happena a few people think that humanlevel intelligence can be achieved by writing large numbers of programs of the kind people are now writing and assembling vast knowledge basis of facts in the languages now used for expressing knowledgehowever most ai researchers believe that new fundamental ideas are required and therefore it cannot be predicted when human level intelligence will be achievedq are computers the right kind of machine to be made intelligenta computers can be programmed to simulate any kind of machinemany researchers invented noncomputer machines hoping that they would be intelligent in different ways than the computer programs could be however they usually simulate their invented machines on a computer and come to doubt that the new machine is worth building because many billions of dollars that have been spent in making computers faster and faster another kind of machine would have to be very fast to perform better than a program on a computer simulating the machineq are computers fast enough to be intelligenta some people think much faster computers are required as well as new ideas my own opinion is that the computers of 30 years ago were fast enough if only we knew how to program them of course quite apart from the ambitions of ai researchers computers will keep getting fasterq what about parallel machinesa machines with many processors are much faster than single processors can be parallelism itself presents no advantages and parallel machines are somewhat awkward to program when extreme speed is required it is necessary to face this awkwardnessq what about making a “child machine” that could improve by reading and by learning from experiencea this idea has been proposed many times starting in the 1940s eventually it will be made to work however ai programs haven’t yet reached the level of being able to learn much of what a child learns from physical experience nor do present programs understand language well enough to learn much by readingq might an ai system be able to bootstrap itself to higher and higher level intelligence by thinking about aia i think yes but we aren’t yet at a level of ai at which this process can beginq what about chessa alexander kronrod a russian ai researcher said “chess is the drosophila of ai” he was making an analogy with geneticists’ use of that fruit fly to study inheritance playing chess requires certain intellectual mechanisms and not others chess programs now play at grandmaster level but they do it with limited intellectual mechanisms compared to those used by a human chess player substituting large amounts of computation for understanding once we understand these mechanisms better we can build humanlevel chess programs that do far less computation than do present programsunfortunately the competitive and commercial aspects of making computers play chess have taken precedence over using chess as a scientific domain it is as if the geneticists after 1910 had organized fruit fly races and concentrated their efforts on breeding fruit flies that could win these racesq what about goa the chinese and japanese game of go is also a board game in which the players take turns moving go exposes the weakness of our present understanding of the intellectual mechanisms involved in human game playing go programs are very bad players in spite of considerable effort not as much as for chess the problem seems to be that a position in go has to be divided mentally into a collection of subpositions which are first analyzed separately followed by an analysis of their interaction humans use this in chess also but chess programs consider the position as a whole chess programs compensate for the lack of this intellectual mechanism by doing thousands or in the case of deep blue many millions of times as much computationsooner or later ai research will overcome this scandalous weaknessq don’t some people say that ai is a bad ideaa the philosopher john searle says that the idea of a nonbiological machine being intelligent is incoherent the philosopher hubert dreyfus says that ai is impossible the computer scientist joseph weizenbaum says the idea is obscene antihuman and immoral various people have said that since artificial intelligence hasn’t reached human level by now it must be impossible still other people are disappointed that companies they invested in went bankruptq aren’t computability theory and computational complexity the keys to ai note to the layman and beginners in computer science these are quite technical branches of mathematical logic and computer science and the answer to the question has to be somewhat technicala no these theories are relevant but don’t address the fundamental problems of aiin the 1930s mathematical logicians especially kurt gödel and alan turing established that there did not exist algorithms that were guaranteed to solve all problems in certain important mathematical domains whether a sentence of first order logic is a theorem is one example and whether a polynomial equations in several variables has integer solutions is another humans solve problems in these domains all the time and this has been offered as an argument usually with some decorations that computers are intrinsically incapable of doing what people do however people can’t guarantee to solve arbitrary problems in these domains eitherin the 1960s computer scientists especially steve cook and richard karp developed the theory of npcomplete problem domains problems in these domains are solvable but seem to take time exponential in the size of the problem which sentences of propositional calculus are satisfiable is a basic example of an npcomplete problem domain humans often solve problems in npcomplete domains in times much shorter than is guaranteed by the general algorithms but can’t solve them quickly in generalwhat is important for ai is to have algorithms as capable as people at solving problems the identification of subdomains for which good algorithms exist is important but a lot of ai problem solvers are not associated with readily identified subdomainsthe theory of the difficulty of general classes of problems is called computational complexity so far this theory hasn’t interacted with ai as much as might have been hoped success in problem solving by humans and by ai programs seems to rely on properties of problems and problem solving methods that the neither the complexity researchers nor the ai community have been able to identify preciselyalgorithmic complexity theory as developed by solomonoff kolmogorov and chaitin independently of one another is also relevant it defines the complexity of a symbolic object as the length of the shortest program that will generate it proving that a candidate program is the shortest or close to the shortest is an unsolvable problem but representing objects by short programs that generate them should be often illuminating even when you can’t prove that the program is the shortestq what are the branches of aia here’s a list but some branches are surely missing because noone has identified them yet some of these may be regarded as concepts or topics rather than full brancheswhat a program knows about the world in general the facts of the specific situation in which it must act and its goals are all represented by sentences of some mathematical logical language the program decides what to do by inferring that certain actions are appropriate for achieving its goals the first article proposing this was mcc59 mcc89 is a more recent summary mcc96 lists some of the concepts involved in logical ai sha97 is an important textai programs often examine large numbers of possibilities eg moves in a chess game or inferences by a theorem proving program discoveries are continually made about how to do this more efficiently in various domainswhen a program makes observations of some kind it is often programmed to compare what it sees with a pattern for example a vision program may try to match a pattern of eyes and a nose in a scene in order to find a face more complex patterns eg in a natural language text in a chess position or in the history of some event are also studied these more complex patterns require quite different methods than do the simple patterns that have been studied the mostfacts about the world have to be represented in some way usually languages of mathematical logic are usedfrom some facts others can be inferred mathematical logical deduction is adequate for some purposes but new methods of nonmonotonic inference have been added to logic since the 1970s the simplest kind of nonmonotonic reasoning is default reasoning in which a conclusion is to be inferred by default but the conclusion can be withdrawn if there is evidence to the contrary for example when we hear of a bird we man infer that it can fly but this conclusion can be reversed when we hear that it is a penguin it is the possibility that a conclusion may have to be withdrawn that constitutes the nonmonotonic character of the reasoning ordinary logical reasoning is monotonic in that the set of conclusions that can the drawn from a set of premises is a monotonic increasing function of the premisesthis is the area in which ai is farthest from humanlevel in spite of the fact that it has been an active research area since the 1950s while there has been considerable progress eg in developing systems of nonmonotonic reasoning and theories of action yet more new ideas are needed the cyc system contains a large but spotty collection of common sense factsprograms do that the approaches to ai based on connectionism and neural nets specialize in that there is also learning of laws expressed in logic mit97 is a comprehensive undergraduate text on machine learning programs can only learn what facts or behaviors their formalisms can represent and unfortunately learning systems are almost all based on very limited abilities to represent informationplanning programs start with general facts about the world especially facts about the effects of actions facts about the particular situation and a statement of a goal from these they generate a strategy for achieving the goal in the most common cases the strategy is just a sequence of actionsthis is a study of the kinds of knowledge that are required for solving problems in the worldontology is the study of the kinds of things that exist in ai the programs and sentences deal with various kinds of objects and we study what these kinds are and what their basic properties are emphasis on ontology begins in the 1990sa heuristic is a way of trying to discover something or an idea imbedded in a program the term is used variously in ai heuristic functions are used in some approaches to search to measure how far a node in a search tree seems to be from a goal heuristic predicates that compare two nodes in a search tree to see if one is better than the other ie constitutes an advance toward the goal may be more useful my opiniongenetic programming is a technique for getting programs to solve a task by mating random lisp programs and selecting fittest in millions of generationsq what are the applications of aia here are someyou can buy machines that can play master level chess for a few hundred dollars there is some ai in them but they play well against people mainly through brute force computation–looking at hundreds of thousands of positions to beat a world champion by brute force and known reliable heuristics requires being able to look at 200 million positions per secondin the 1990s computer speech recognition reached a practical level for limited purposes thus united airlines has replaced its keyboard tree for flight information by a system using speech recognition of flight numbers and city names it is quite convenient on the the other hand while it is possible to instruct some computers using speech most users have gone back to the keyboard and the mouse as still more convenientjust getting a sequence of words into a computer is not enough parsing sentences is not enough either the computer has to be provided with an understanding of the domain the text is about and this is presently possible only for very limited domainsthe world is composed of threedimensional objects but the inputs to the human eye and computers’ tv cameras are two dimensional some useful programs can work solely in two dimensions but full computer vision requires partial threedimensional information that is not just a set of twodimensional views at present there are only limited ways of representing threedimensional information directly and they are not as good as what humans evidently usea “knowledge engineer” interviews experts in a certain domain and tries to embody their knowledge in a computer program for carrying out some task how well this works depends on whether the intellectual mechanisms required for the task are within the present state of ai when this turned out not to be so there were many disappointing results one of the first expert systems was mycin in 1974 which diagnosed bacterial infections of the blood and suggested treatments it did better than medical students or practicing doctors provided its limitations were observed namely its ontology included bacteria symptoms and treatments and did not include patients doctors hospitals death recovery and events occurring in time its interactions depended on a single patient being considered since the experts consulted by the knowledge engineers knew about patients doctors death recovery etc it is clear that the knowledge engineers forced what the experts told them into a predetermined framework in the present state of ai this has to be true the usefulness of current expert systems depends on their users having common senseone of the most feasible kinds of expert system given the present knowledge of ai is to put some information in one of a fixed set of categories using several sources of information an example is advising whether to accept a proposed credit card purchase information is available about the owner of the credit card his record of payment and also about the item he is buying and about the establishment from which he is buying it eg about whether there have been previous credit card frauds at this establishmentq how is ai research donea ai research has both theoretical and experimental sides the experimental side has both basic and applied aspectsthere are two main lines of research one is biological based on the idea that since humans are intelligent ai should study humans and imitate their psychology or physiology the other is phenomenal based on studying and formalizing common sense facts about the world and the problems that the world presents to the achievement of goals the two approaches interact to some extent and both should eventually succeed it is a race but both racers seem to be walkingq what should i study before or while learning aia study mathematics especially mathematical logic the more you learn about science in general the better for the biological approaches to ai study psychology and the physiology of the nervous system learn some programming languagesat least c lisp and prolog it is also a good idea to learn one basic machine language jobs are likely to depend on knowing the languages currently in fashion in the late 1990s these include c and javaq what is a good textbook on aia artificial

intelligence al encompasses a diverse number of computer applications or components within applications that use sets of rules and knowledge to make inferences unlike its roots as an esoteric discipline of trying to make computers emulate the human mind modern al—along with the technologies it has inspired—has many practical ramifications and delivers real benefits to users in business applications al capabilities are often integrated with systems that serve the daytoday needs of the enterprise such as inventory tracking manufacturing process controls and customer service databases often however these newer practical implementations of al may not be labeled as such because of negative associations with the termdefining ai succinctly is difficult because it takes so many forms one area of agreement is that artificial intelligence is a field of scientific inquiry rather than an end product ai is difficult to define with any precision partially because several different groups of researchers with drastically different motivations are working in the field perhaps the best definition is that coined by ml minsky artificial intelligence is the science of making machines do things that would require intelligence if done by mencharles babbage 17921871 an english mathematician is generally acknowledged to be the father of modern computing around 1823 he invented a working model of the worlds first practical mechanical calculator then he began work on his analytical engine which had the basic elements of a modernday computer unfortunately he was unable to raise the funds needed to build his machine nevertheless his ideas lived onherman hollerith 18601929 an american inventor actually created the first working calculating machine which was used to tabulate the results of the 1890 us census there ensued a series of rapid improvements to machines which allegedly thought the first true electronic computer the electronic numerical integrator and computer eniac was developed in 1946 the socalled giant brain replaced mechanical switches with glass vacuum tubes eniac used 17468 vacuum tubes and occupied 1800 square feet—the size of an average house it weighed 30 tons scientists began at once to build smaller computersin 1959 scientists at bell laboratories invented the transistor which marked the beginning of the second generation of computers transistors replaced vacuum tubes and sped up processing considerably they also made possible a large increase in computer memory ten years later international business machines corp ibm created thirdgeneration computers when they replaced transistors with integrated circuits a single integrated circuit could replace a large number of transistors in a silicon chip less than oneeighth of an inch square more importantly integrated circuits allowed manufacturers to dramatically reduce the size of computers new software that made use of increased speed and memory complemented these thirdgeneration computers—which themselves proved to be short livedonly two years after the appearance of integrated circuits intel corp introduced microprocessor chips one chip contained a computers central processing unit prior to that time computers contained specialized chips for functions such as logic and programming intels invention placed all of the computers functions on one chip scientists continued to improve on computersminiaturization of chips led to largescale integrated circuitry lsi and verylargescale integrated circuitry vlsi lsi and vlsi enabled software and printers to react faster with each other and with computers they also contributed to the invention of microcomputers which revolutionized the role of computers in business more importantly lsi and vlsi heightened scientists interest in the development of alai is the construction andor programming of computers to imitate human thought processes scientists are trying to design computers capable of processing natural languages and reasoning they believe that once machines can process natural languages such as english or spanish humans will be able to give instructions and ask questions without learning special computer languages when that day arrives machines like humans will be able to learn from past experience and apply what they have learned to solve new problems scientists have a long way to go but they have made what they believe is a giant step in that direction with the invention of fuzzy logicsince their inception computers have always acted on a yes or no basis they simply have not been able to recognize maybe even the most sophisticated computers capable of performing millions of calculations per second cannot distinguish between slightly or very this simple difference has confused al scientists for years however an american researcher dr lofti a zadeh of the university of california presented a possible answer which he termed fuzzy logicthe concept is based on feeding the computer fuzzy sets or groupings of concrete information and relative concepts for example in a fuzzy set for industrial furnaces a temperature of 1000 degrees might have a membership relative value of 095 while a temperature of 600 might have a membership of 050 a computer program might then utilize instructions such as the higher the temperature the lower the pressure must be this solution means that programmers can teach machines to compute with words instead of numbershistorically most complex mathematical models developed by programmers compute strictly with numbers however the fuzzy logic approach to al did not catch on in the american scientific community it did however among the japanesejapanbased hitachi ltd developed an artificial intelligence system based on fuzzy logic that allowed an automated subway system in sendai japan to brake more swiftly and smoothly than it could under human guidance the japanese ministry of international trade and industry budgeted 36 million in 1990 to subsidize the initial operation of a laboratory for international fuzzy engineering development of fuzzy engineering also took hold in china russia and much of western europe american scientists however pursued other aspects of alin the early 1990s a university of north carolina professor developed a microprocessor chip using an alldigital architecture which would allow it to run in conventional computers the chip can handle 580000 ifthen decisions per second which is more than 100 times faster than the best japanese fuzzylogic chip can operate many us companies have been experimenting with this and similar chips the oak ridge national laboratory is using the chip in robots to be employed in radioactive areas of nuclear power plants the oricon corporation has used fuzzy logic in a signal analysis system for submarines nasa has also experimented with using fuzzy logic to help dock spacecraftother al applications are also in use one is the socalled expert system expert systems are computerbased systems that apply the substantial knowledge of a specialist—be it in medicine law insurance or almost any field—to help solve complex problems without requiring a human to work through each one in developing such systems designers usually work with experts to determine the information and decision rules heuristics that the experts use when confronted with particular types of problems in essence these programs are simply attempting to imitate human behavior rather than solving problems by themselvesthere are several advantages to expert systems for example they give novices instant expertise in a particular area they capture knowledge and expertise that might be lost if a human expert retires or dies moreover the knowledge of multiple experts can be integrated at least theoretically to make the systems expertise more comprehensive than that of any individual expert systems are not subject to human problems of illness or fatigue and if they are well designed can be less prone to inconsistencies and mistakes these benefits make them particularly attractive to businessescompanies also use expert systems for training and analysis general electric for instance developed a system called delta that helps maintenance workers identify and correct malfunctions in locomotives digital equipment corporation uses xcon derived from expert configurer to match customers needs with the most appropriate combination of computer input output and memory devices the system uses more than 3000 decision rules and 5000 product descriptions to analyze sales orders and design layouts ensuring that the companys equipment will work when it arrives at customers sites xcon catches most configuration errors and eliminates the need for completely assembling a computer system for testing and then breaking it down again for shipment to the customer the system is expensive however dec spends 2 million per year just to update xcon in fact cost is one of the most prohibitive factors involved in the development of al systems however when such a system is implemented effectively the money it saves in staff hours and costs from averted human errors can quickly recoup development costs in large corporations the savings can accrue in the tens of millions of dollars per yeara moderatesized system consisting of about 300 decision rules generally costs between 250000 and 500000 to design that is a great deal of money to spend on creating systems that do little more than play chess—which was what some designers did back in the 1960sscientists in the 1960s developed machines that could play chess in an attempt to create machines that could think by themselves they made tremendous strides in developing sophisticated decision trees that could map out possible moves but those programs included so many potential alternatives that even contemporary supercomputers cannot assess them within a reasonable amount of time they reduced the number of alternatives which allowed the machines to play at the chess master level to simulate the thinking process the computers processed large amounts of data on alternative moves some of these experiments continue through the present a highly publicized success in this area came in 1997 when an ibm supercomputer named deep blue beat world chess champion garry kasparov in a matchneural networks go one step further than expert systems in bringing stored knowledge to bear on practical problems instead of just leading the user to the appropriate piece of knowledge that has been captured in the system neural networks process patterns of information to arrive at new abilities they werent equipped with on day one in a sense they learn to do things for the user based on special preparation that involves feeding the system data which it then analyzes for patterns this approach has proven highly effective in a number of fields including finance information technology management and health carefor instance a neural network might be employed to predict which loan applicants are too risky rather than programming the computer with exact userdefined criteria for what constitutes a risky applicant the neural network would be trained on a large volume of application data from past loans— especially on details about the problematic ones the neural network would process the data thoroughly and arrive at its own evaluation criteria then as new applications come in the computer would use this knowledge to predict the risks involved as time passes the neural network could receive periodic or even continuous retraining on new data so that it continues to hone its accuracy based on current trends reallife systems such as this have enjoyed a high success rate and have been able to reduce the number of bad loans at the lending institutions that use themal is being used extensively in the business world despite the fact that the discipline itself is still in the embryonic stages of development its applications cross a wide spectrum for example al is being applied in management and administration science engineering manufacturing financial and legal areas military and space endeavors medicine and diagnosticssome al implementations include natural language processing database retrieval expert consulting systems theorem proving robotics automatic programming scheduling and solving perceptual problems management is relying more and more on knowledge work systems which are systems used to aid professionals such as architects engineers and medical technicians in the creation and dissemination of new knowledge and information one such system is in use at square d an electrical component manufacturer a computer does the design work for giant units of electrical equipment the units generally share the same basic elements but vary in required size specifications and features however as is the case with most altype systems human intervention is still required an engineer is needed to check the computerproduced drawing before the equipment is put into productionsenior managers in many companies use albased strategic planning systems to assist in functions like competitive analysis technology deployment and resource allocation they also use programs to assist in equipment configuration design product distribution regulatorycompliance advisement and personnel assessment al is contributing heavily to managements organization planning and controlling operations and will continue to do so with more frequency as programs are refinedai is also influential in science and engineering the applications developed were used to organize and manipulate the everincreasing amounts of information available to scientists and engineers ai has been used in complex processes such as mass spectrometry analysis biological classifications and the creation of semiconductor circuits and automobile components al has been used with increasing frequency in diffraction and image analysis power plant and space station design and robot sensing control and programming it is the increased use of robotics in business that is alarming many critics of artificial intelligencerobots are being utilized more frequently in the business world in 1990 over 200000 robots were in use in us factories experts predict that by the year 2025 robots could potentially replace humans in almost all manufacturing jobs this includes not only the mundane tasks but also those requiring specialized skills they will be performing jobs such as shearing sheep scraping barnacles from the bottoms of ships and sandblasting walls however there are jobs that robots will never be able to perform such as surgery of course there will still be a need for individuals to design build and maintain robots yet once scientists develop robots that can think as well as act there may be less of a need for human intervention thus the social ramifications of al is of major concern to people todayin spite of its great advances and strong promise al in name has suffered from low esteem in both academic and corporate settings to some the name is inexorably—and unfavorably—associated with impractical chessplaying computers and recluse professors trying to build a thinking machine as a result many developers of al theories and applications consciously shun the moniker preferring instead to use the newer jargon of fuzzy applications flexible software and datamining tools in avoiding the label al they have found more receptive audiences among corporate decisionmakers and private investors for their alinspired technologiesthus while the practices and ideas known as al are hardly dead the name itself is drifting toward obscurity this is true not only because of the perceived stigma but also as a consequence of the diversity and heterogeneity of ways in which al concepts have been implemented furthermore these concepts are verging on ubiquity in software applications programming such disparate objectives as building a customer order system implementing a selfdiagnostic manufacturing system designing a sophisticated search engine and adding voicerecognition capabilities to applications all employ ai theories and methods indeed ford motor company was slated to implement an enginediagnostic neural network in its car

2015artificial intelligence ai and increasingly complex algorithms currently influence our lives and our civilization more than ever before the areas of ai application are diverse and the possibilities farreaching and thanks to recent improvements in computer hardware certain ai algorithms already surpass the capacities of today’s human experts as ai capacity improves its field of application will continue to grow in concrete terms it is likely that the relevant algorithms will start optimizing themselves to an ever greater degree and may one day attain superhuman levels of intelligence this technological progress is likely to present us with historically unprecedented ethical challenges many experts believe that alongside global opportunities ai poses global risks surpassing those of eg nuclear technology whose risks were severely underestimated prior to their development furthermore scientific risk analyses suggest that high potential damages resulting from ai should be taken very seriously—even if the probability of their occurrence were lowin narrow welltested areas of application such as driverless cars and certain areas of medical diagnostics the superiority of ais over humans is already established an increased use of technology in these areas o\x1bffers great potential including fewer road traff\x1bic accidents fewer mistakes in the medical treatment and diagnosing of patients and the discovery of many new therapies and pharmaceuticals in complex systems where several algorithms interact at high speed such as in the financial market or in foreseeable military uses there is a heightened risk that new ai technologies will be misused or will experience unexpected systematic failures there is also the threat of an arms race in which the safety of technological developments is sacrificed in favor of rapid progress in any case it is crucial to know which goals or ethical values ought to be programmed into ai algorithms and to have a technical guarantee that the goals remain stable and resistant to manipulation with driverless cars for instance there is the wellknown question of how the algorithm should act if a collision with several pedestrians can only be avoided by endangering the passengers not to mention how it can be ensured that the algorithms of driverless cars are not at risk of hacking systematic failuremeasure 1 the promotion of a factual rational discourse is essential so that cultural prejudices can be dismantled and the most pressing questions of safety can be focused uponmeasure 2 legal frameworks must be adapted so as to include the risks and potential of new technologies ai manufacturers should be required to invest more in the safety and reliability of technologies and principles like predictability transparency and nonmanipulability should be enforced so that the risk of and potential damage from unexpected catastrophes can be minimizedprogress in ai research makes it possible to replace increasing amounts of human jobs with machines many economists assume that this increasing automation could lead to a massive increase in unemployment within even the next 1020 years it should be noted that while similar predictions in the past have proved inaccurate the developments discussed here are of a new kind and it would be irresponsible to ignore the possibility that these predictions come true at some point through progressive automation the global statistical average living standard will rise however there is no guarantee that all people—or even a majority of people—will benefit from thismeasure 3 can we as a society deal with the consequences of ai automation in a sensible way are our current social systems su\x1biciently prepared for a future wherein the human workforce increasingly gives way to machines these questions must be clarified in detail if need be proactive measures should be taken to cushion negative developments or to render them more positive proposals like an unconditional basic income or a negative income tax are worth examining as possible ways to ensure a fair distribution of the profits from increased productivitymany ai experts consider it plausible that this century will witness the creation of ais whose intelligence surpasses that of humans in all respects the goals of such ais could in principle take on any possible form of which human ethical goals represent only a tiny proportion and would influence the future of our planet decisively in ways that could pose an existential risk to humanity our species only dominates earth and for better or worse all other species inhabiting it because it currently has the highest level of intelligence but it is plausible that by the end of the century ais will be developed whose intelligence compares to ours as ours currently compares to say chimpanzees moreover the possibility cannot be excluded that ais also develop phenomenal states—ie selfconsciousness and in particular subjective preferences and the capacity for su\x1bffering—in the future which would confront us with new kinds of ethical challenges in view of the immediate relevance of the problem and its longerterm implications considerations of ai safety are currently highly underrepresented in politics as well as researchmeasure 4 it is worth developing institutional measures to promote safety for example by granting research funding to projects which concentrate on the analysis and prevention of risks in ai development politicians must in general allocate more resources towards the ethical development of futureshaping technologiesmeasure 5 eff\x1borts towards international research collaboration analogous to cern’s role in particle physics are to be encouraged international coordination is particularly essential in the field of ai because it also minimizes the risk of a technological arms race a ban on all risky ai research would not be practicable as it would lead to a rapid and dangerous relocation of research to countries with lower safety standardsmeasure 6 certain ai systems are likely to have the capacity to su\x1bffer particularly neuromorphic ones as they are structured analogously to the human brain research projects that develop or test such ais should be placed under the supervision of ethical commissions analogous to animal research commissionsread

when building or enhancing an artificial intelligence infrastructure to support ai applications and workloadsthese are not trivial issues a companys ultimate success with ai will likely depend on how suitable its environment is for such powerful applications while the cloud is emerging as a major resource for dataintensive ai workloads enterprises still rely on their onpremises it environments for these projectsone of the biggest considerations is ai data storage specifically the ability to scale storage as the volume of data grows as organizations prepare enterprise ai strategies and build the necessary infrastructure storage must be a top priority that includes ensuring the proper storage capacity iops and reliability to deal with the massive data amounts required for effective aifiguring out what kind of storage an organization needs depends on many factors including the level of ai an organization plans to use and whether they need to make realtime decisionsfor example for advanced highvalue neural network ecosystems traditional networkattached storage architectures might present scaling issues with io and latency similarly a financial services company that uses enterprise ai systems for realtime trading decisions may need fast allflash storage technologymany companies are already building big data and analytics environments that leverage hadoop and other frameworks designed to support enormous data volumes and these will likely be suitable for many types of ai applicationsanother factor is the nature of the source data ai applications depend on source data so an organization needs to know where the source data resides and how ai applications will use it for instance will applications be analyzing sensor data in real time or will they use postprocessingyou also need to factor in how much ai data applications will generate ai applications make better decisions as theyre exposed to more data as databases grow over time companies need to monitor capacity and plan for expansion as needednetworking is another key component of an artificial intelligence infrastructure to provide the high efficiency at scale required to support ai organizations will likely need to upgrade their networksdeep learning algorithms are highly dependent on communications and enterprise networks will need to keep stride with demand as ai efforts expand thats why scalability must be a high priority and that will require highbandwidth lowlatency and creative architecturescompanies should automate wherever possible for example they should deploy automated infrastructure management tools in their data centersnetwork infrastructure providers meanwhile are looking to do the same softwaredefined networks are being combined with machine learning to create intentbased networks that can anticipate network demands or security threats and react in realtimealso critical for an artificial intelligence infrastructure is having sufficient compute resources including cpus and gpusa cpubased environment can handle basic ai workloads but deep learning involves multiple large data sets and deploying scalable neural network algorithms for that cpubased computing might not be sufficientto provide the necessary compute capabilities companies must turn to gpus deploying gpus enables organizations to optimize their data center infrastructure and gain power efficiencycurrently many companies rely mostly on repurposed gpus for their ai efforts but they also take advantage of cloud infrastructure resources as well as the general declining cost of processors nvidia and intel are both pushing aifocused gpusmeanwhile startup graphcore launched a new aispecific processing architecture called intelligent processing unit to lower the cost of accelerating ai applications in the cloud and in enterprise data centersorganizations have much to consider not only do they have to choose where they will store data how they will move it across networks and how they will process it they also have to choose how they will prepare the data for use in ai applicationsone of the critical steps for successful enterprise ai is data cleansing also called data scrubbing its the process of updating or removing data from a database that is inaccurate incomplete improperly formatted or duplicatedany company but particularly those in datadriven sectors should consider deploying automated data cleansing tools to assess data for errors using rules or algorithms data quality is especially critical with ai if the data feeding ai systems is inaccurate or out of date the output and any related business decisions will also be inaccurateanother important factor is data access does the organization have the proper mechanisms in place to deliver data in a secure and efficient manner to the users who need itas such part of the data management strategy needs to ensure that users machines and people have easy and fast access to data it should be accessible from a variety of endpoints including mobile devices via wireless networksaccess also raises a number of privacy and security issues so data access controls are important companies need to look at technologies such as identity and access management and data encryption tools as part of their data management and governance strategiesno discussion of artificial intelligence infrastructure would be complete without mentioning the growing impact of the internet of things iot iot involves gathering and analyzing data from countless devices products sensors assets locations vehicles etc that are connected via the internet ai and iot are closely tied because organizations need to apply intelligence to gain insights from all the information coming in from connected thingsgartner estimates that 84 billion connected things were in use worldwide in 2017 up 31 from 2016 and that number will reach 204 billion by 2020 imagine the staggering amount of data generated by connected objects and it will be up to companies to integrate manage and secure all of this informationfrom an artificial intelligence infrastructure standpoint companies need to look at their networks data storage data analytics and security platforms to make sure they can effectively handle the growth of their iot ecosystems that includes data generated by their own devices as well as those of their supply chain partnerslast but certainly not least training and skills development are vital for any it endeavor and especially enterprise ai initiatives companies will need data analysts data scientists developers cybersecurity experts network engineers and it professionals with a variety of skills to build and maintain their infrastructure to support ai and to use artificial intelligence technologies such as machine learning natural language processing and deep learning on an ongoing basisthey will also need people who are capable of managing the various aspects of

will not only change how we use cars but—in the long term – how our smart cities are designed autonomous driving became possible by recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence technologies—deep learning is one examplethere are other very exciting ways artificial intelligence technologies help improve the driving experience case in point intelligent personal assistants while most assistants proliferate on a smartphone there is innovation happening behind the wheel that brings an automotive assistant to bear that fulfills your drivingrelated needs better faster and safer these are the four main pillars in ai being applied to the connected carwe make it possible for people to talk to and interact with machines – an experience that continues to become easier over time with advancements in natural language understanding in fact being able to speak to your devices and cars is an expectation you can say what you want in almost any way you like and have longer conversations now the machines will remember what you said before even if it was yesterday and use that to get to the desired outcome more quickly and with less effort also just like humans the car will be able to recognize you by your voice through voice biometrics technology which is useful to distinguish you from your spouse for example that means even more personalization so when you use your spouse’s car and say “let’s drive to work” the car will get you to your workplace not your spouse’s workplacesince the car by definition is moving from place to place the contexts in which it operates change frequently you might be on the highway or on a dirt road in the countryside maybe there is a traffic jam ahead or a road closure there may be sunshine at your current location but a snowstorm at your destination each of these can provide additional information that will make your interaction with the car more meaningfulcontext also includes sensor reading from the car itself eg fuel level crash avoidance sensors or how many people are in the car these parameters matter for making smart decisions when driving and are taken into account by the contextual reasoning framework essentially it’s artificial intelligence that thinks for you the system knows that in a snowstorm covered parking is certainly the preferred option it will also try to find the cheapest parking for you based on your estimated arrival time and will find a gas station on your route that requires only a small detour but is cheap at the same time if you have a loyalty card that will also be considered it will even recognize that the traffic jam ahead will likely cause you to be late for your meeting and offer to send your colleagues a note about your delay these ideas aren’t simply flashy our research shows that users are excited about cars that can make this a realityuntil fully automated vehicles arrive decisions while driving can only demand a certain amount of attention from drivers since the primary focus should always be on the road to enable a safe journey but in many situations this is difficult to realize say you are looking for a parking space or a restaurant for dinner or you want to create a playlist with a certain type of music in all of these situations there are too many options to choose from to make an informed decision while staying focused on the road enter personalizationhere you will start a dialog with your car where you can specify some core criteria of your request this system will take everything it knows about you into account and provide a recommendation which you can accept or modify crucially the system in your car will remember your choices and take them into account the next time you are searching for something you are implicitly training the machine to learn your likes and dislikes and after a certain time many of its recommendation will become so good that you can blindly accept them and if you feel like something different today you can always say so this last part is key – nhtsa national highway traffic safety administration guidelines suggest that the driver should always remain in control of the conversation and our own research shows that drivers want this ability even for systems they trust as very accuratehaving the right information at the right time is also crucial when driving in your car consider two examples smart car manual and travel guide smart car manual allows you to ask a wide range of information related to your car such as “how do i adjust the height of the steering wheel” or “what is this yellow blinking light on my dashboard” especially when your car is new or a rental this functionality allows to quickly familiarize yourself with the vehicle another aspect of this is a smart travel guide it allows you to ask questions about your current location your destination interesting sights along your route or at your destination you could ask “what’s that building on the hill to the right” or “what are the top sights at my destination” or simply “what can i do around here” is a great way to discover new things it’s like your personal travel guide that is really knowledgeable about almost any place you visit easily accessible while you’re on the roadwe’re at a crossroads and that’s what i found so exciting what was once the stuff of fiction is becoming a reality but we’re not doing it for the sake of

singlesource access to the expertise of bloomberg law’s privacy and data security editorial team contributing practitionersby stephen gardner oct 19 — international privacy regulators are increasingly concerned about the need to balance innovation and consumer protection in artificial intelligence and other data driven technologies global privacy chiefs said oct 19 data protection officials from more than 60 countries expressed their concerns over challenges posed by the emerging fields of robotics artificial intelligence and machine learning due to the new techs unpredictable outcomes the global privacy regulators also discussed the difficulties of regulating encryption standards and how to balance law enforcement agency access to information with personal privacy rights such technological developments “pose challenges for a consent model of data collection” and may lead to an increase in data privacy risks john edwards new zealand privacy commissioner said at the 38th international data protection and privacy commissioners conference in marrakesh morocco for example decisionmaking machines may be used to “engender or manipulate the trust of the user” and would be an “all seeing all remembering inhouse guests” that would collect personal data via numerous sensors peter fleischer global privacy counsel at alphabet incs google said that established privacy principles would continue to be relevant for new technologies but machine learning raised particular problems such as machines finding “ways to reidentify data” the emerging technologies may have a broad impact across various industries “humans teaching machines to learn” was a “revolution in the making” that may have broad societal consequences that could cut across numerous economic sectors fleischer said for example datadriven machines may have the ability to analyze sensitive medical data make medical diagnoses thereby potentially revolutionizing the healthcare industry fleischer said at the conference machines that learn would act “like a chef see the ingredients and comes up with something new” he said unknowable algorithms machines that learn through collecting realworld data may pose privacy challenges “that we are only beginning to understand” edwards said machines may make decisions based on an algorithm that is “not known and is in fact unknowable by the designer or user of the application” would pose particular problems of “responsibility or accountability for automated decision making” edwards said edwards said that care is needed to ensure that decisions taken by machines didnt reflect biases inherent in the initial data used as the basis for machine learning federal trade commission chairman edith ramirez compared the machine learning problems to how drones collect data there may be “no traditional way for operators to make disclosures about what information they are collecting and how they will use it” she said ramirez also pointed to problems in regulating emerging technologies due to the ambiguity surrounding data collection practices the enforcement of privacy in the context of emerging technologies is complex because of the interconnection of devices she said asimov principles the privacy commissioners conference didnt provide specific answers to looming challenges for privacy regulation the role of the annual conference is rather to highlight issues that are likely to become significant marc rotenberg president of the electronic privacy information center said that in terms of robotics and machine learning privacy commissioners may consider supplementing isaac asimovs three laws of robotics—a robot should not injure a human obey human orders unless it would lead to the injuring of a human and protect itself unless that would contravene the first two laws rotenberg proposed that in addition robots must always reveal the basis of their decisions and robots must always reveal their identities rotenberg said that “we believe increasingly in the importance of algorithmic transparency” which would conform with the suggested rule that robots should always reveal the basis of their decisions ramirez said that regulators should build up expertise in emerging technologies so they have a thorough understanding of them as the basis for regulation privacy commissioners would likely need help from researchers and technologists because they must understand “not only what is happening today but what is likely to happen tomorrow” she said encryption difficulties encryption has also puzzled privacy regulators who say that its hard to balance consumer privacy with law enforcement agencies access to information for legitimate purposes edwards said that encryption protects the data of companies and individuals but “poses a significant challenge for law enforcement agencies and others with lawful authority to intercept communications “no satisfactory response to this challenge has yet been identified” though few companies favor the introduction of back doors so that law enforcement authorities can access encrypted communications for valid purposes jane horvath senior director of global privacy at apple inc spoke strongly in favor of encryption technologies and said “a government demand for back doors puts everyones security at risk” “security is an endless race” and “encryption in short protects people” horvath said to contact the reporter on this story stephen gardner in marrakesh morocco at correspondentsbnacom to contact the editors responsible for this story donald g aplin at daplinbnacom

welcome to the closing session of the council on foreign relations 22nd annual term member conference with ray kurzweili’m nicholas thompson i will be presiding over today’s sessioni’d also like to thank andrew gundlach him and the annamaria and stephen kellen foundation for their generous support of the cfr term member program i was a term member a couple years ago i love this program what a great event i’m so glad to be here laughteri’m also glad to be here with ray all right i’m going to read ray’s biography and then i’m going to dig into some questions about how the world is changing and he will blow your mind laughterso ray kurzweil is one of the world’s leading inventors thinkers and futurists with a 30year track record of accurate predictions it’s true if you look at his early books they’re 96 percent 98 percent accurate called “the restless genius” by the wall street journal “the ultimate thinking machine” by forbes magazine he was selected as one of the top entrepreneurs by inc magazine which described him as the rightful heir to thomas edison pbs selected him as one of the 16 revolutionaries who made america reading his bio i was upset that he quotes all of my competitors so i’m going to add a quote from wired magazine which is “his mission is bolder than any voyage to space”—wired magazine laughterray was the principal inventor of the first ccd flatbed scanner the first omnifont optical character recognition the first printtospeech reading machine for the blind the first texttospeech synthesizer the first music synthesizer capable of recreating the grand piano and other orchestral instruments and the first commercially marketed largevocabulary speech recognitionamong ray’s many honors he received a grammy award for outstanding achievements in music technology he is the recipient of the national medal of technology was inducted into the national inventors hall of fame holds 21 honorary doctorates and honors from three us presidents amazingray has written five national bestselling books which you should all buy immediately if you’re on your phones including new york times bestsellers “the singularity is near” and “how to create a mind” he is cofounder and chancellor of singularity university and director of engineering at google heading up a team developing machine intelligence and natural language understandinghe also as i learned walking here is the father of one of my sister’s friends from grade school who referred to him as the cool dad with the electric pianos so laughter welcome raykurzweil great to be herethompson all right so some of you are probably familiar with his work some of you may not be but let’s begin ray by talking about the law of accelerating returns what that means for technology lay out a framework for what’s about to happen and then we’ll dig into how foreign policy is going to be turned on its headkurzweil sure well that’s the basis of my futurism in 1981 i realized that the key to being successful as an inventor was timing the inventors whose names you recognize like thomas edison or my new boss—my first boss larry page were in the right place with the right idea at the right time and timing turns out to be important for everything from writing magazine articles to making investments to romance you got to be at the right place at the right timeso i started with the common wisdom that you cannot predict the future and i made a very surprising discovery there’s actually one thing about the future that’s remarkably predictable and that is that the price performance and capacity not of everything not of every technology but of every information technology follows a very predictable path and that path is exponential not linear so that’s the law of accelerating returns but it bears a little explanationso i had the priceperformance of computing—calculations per second per constant dollar—going back to the 1890 census through 1980 on a logarithmic scale where a straight line is exponential growth it was a gradual second level of exponential but it was a very smooth curve and you could not see world war i or world war ii or the great depression or the cold war on that curve so i projected it out to 2050 we’re now 36 years later it’s exactly where it should be so this is not just looking backward now and overfitting to past data but this has been a forwardlooking progression that started in 1981 and it’s true of many different measures of information technologyand the progression is not linear it’s exponential and our brains are linear if you wonder why we have a brain it’s to predict the future but the kind of challenges we had you know 50000 years ago when our brains were evolving were linear ones we’d look up and say ok that animal’s going that way i’m coming up the path this way we’re going to meet at that rock that’s not a good idea i’m going to take a different path that was good for survival that became hardwired in our brains we didn’t expect that animal to speed up as it went along we made a linear projectionthe primary difference between myself and my critics and many of them are coming around is we look at the same world they apply their linear intuition for example halfway through the genome project 1 percent of the genome had been collected after seven years so mainstream critics said i told you this wasn’t going to work here you are seven years 1 percent it’s going to take 700 years just like we said my reaction at the time was well we finished 1 percent we’re almost done because 1 percent is only seven doublings from 100 percent and have been doubling every year indeed that continued the project was finished seven years later that’s continued since the end of the genome project that first genome cost a billion dollars we’re now down to 1000 and every other aspect of what we call biotechnology—understanding this data modeling simulating it and most importantly reprograming it is progressing exponentiallyand i’ll mention just one implication of the law of accelerating returns because it has many ripple effects and it’s really behind this remarkable digital revolution we see is the 50 percent deflation rate in information technologies so i can get the same computation communication genetic sequencing brain data as i could a year ago for half the price today that’s why you can buy an iphone or an android phone that’s twice as good as the one two years ago for twice the price you put some of the improved price performance in price and some of it into performance so you asked me actually just a few minutes a question that i was also asked by christine lagarde head of the imf at her annual meeting recently how come we don’t see this in productivity statistics and that’s because we factor it out we put it in the numerator and the denominatorso when this girl in africa buys a smartphone for 75 it counts as 75 of economic activity despite the fact that it’s literally a trillion dollars of computation circa 1960 a billion dollars circa 1980 it’s got millions of dollars of free information apps just one of which is an encyclopedia far better than the one i saved up for years as a teenager to buy all that counts for zero in economic activity because it’s free so we really don’t count the value of these products and people who compile these statistics say well we take into consideration quality improvement in products but really using models that use the old linear assumptionso then christine said yes it’s true the digital world’s amazing we can do all these remarkable things but you can’t wear information technology you can’t eat it you can’t wear it you can’t live in it and that’s—and my next point is all of that’s going to change we’ll be able to print out clothing using 3d printers not today we’re kind of in the hype phase of 3d printing but the 2020s—early 2020s we’ll be able to print out clothing there’ll be lots of cool opensource designs you can download for free we’ll still have a fashion industry just like we still have a music and movie and book industry coexistence of free opensource products—which are a great leveler—and proprietary products we’ll print—we’ll be able to create food very inexpensively using 3d—vertical agriculture using hydroponic plants for fruits and vegetables invitro cloning of muscle tissue for meat the first hamburger to be produced this way has already been consumed it was expensive it was a few hundred thousand dollars but—laughter—but it was very good laughterthompson a free side—that’s like what it costskurzweil but that’s research costs so it’s a long discussion but all of these different resources are going to become information technologies a building was put together recently as a demo using little modules snapped together legostyle printed on a 3d printer in asia put together a threestory office building in a few days that’ll be the nature of construction in the 2020s 3d printers will print out the physical things we need she said ok but we’re getting very crowded land is not expanding that’s not an information technology and i said well actually there’s lots of land we just have decided to crowd ourselves together so we can work and play together cities was an early invention we’re already spreading out with even the crude virtual and augmented reality we have today try taking a train trip anywhere in the world and you’ll see that 97 percent of the land is unusedthompson all right so lots coming laughter let’s talk about intelligence so like the phone in my pocket it’s better than i am at math it’s better than i am at go it’s better than i am at a lot of things when will it be better at me at holding a conversation when will the phone interview you instead of mekurzweil we do have technologies that can have conversations i mean my team at google created smart replies you knowthompson and when you—ray actually answers all of your emails is another way to describe his job at google which is amazingkurzweil yeah so we’re writing millions of emails and it has to understand the meaning of the email it’s responding to even though the proposed suggestions are brief but your question really is a turing equivalent question you need—it’s equivalent to the turing test and i’m a believer that the turing test is a valid test on the full range of human intelligence you need the full flexibility of human intelligence to pass a valid turing test there’s no sort of simple natural languageprocessing tricks you can do to do that that’s where a human judge can tell the difference between talking over what you call teletype lines basically instant messaging with an ai versus a human and if the human judge can’t tell the difference then we consider the human—the ai to be at human levels which is really what you’re askingi’ve been—that’s been a key prediction of mine i’ve been consistent in saying 2029 in 1989 in the age of intelligent machines i bounded that between early 2020s and late 2030s and in the age of spiritual machines in ’99 i said 2029 the stanford—the stanford ai department found that daunting so they held a conference and the consensus of the ai experts at that time was hundreds of years twentyfive percent thought it would never happen my view and the consensus view or the median view of ai experts have been getting closer together but not because i’ve been changing my view laughter and in 2006 there was a dartmouth conferenced called ai 50 celebrating the 50th anniversary of the 1956 dartmouth conference where ai—artificial intelligence got its name by john mccarthy and marvin minsky who was my mentor for over 50 yearsand the consensus then was 50 years so at that time i was saying 23 years we just had actually an ai ethics conference at asilomar patterned on the successful biotech asilomar conference of 40 years earlier and the consensus view there was about 20 to 30 years i’m saying well at that time 13 so the median view now is—i’m still more optimistic but not by that much and there’s a growing group of people who think i’m too conservative i think that a key issue i didn’t mention with the law of accelerating returns is not only does the hardware progress exponentially but so does the software and that’s a long discussion but we can see now the daunting pace of progress—with one milestone after another falling to ai and we can talk about some of the techniques but so i’m feeling more and more confident i think the ai community is gaining confidence that we’re not far off from that milestonethompson all right so i’ve got 12 more years i can do this kind of thing so anybody in the cfr booking department please keep inviting me because i do enjoy doing these and time is limited laughterlet’s talk a little bit about regulation there are a lot of people in this—kurzweil well let me comment on that this is not an alien invasion of intelligent machines from mars we create tools to extent our reach we couldn’t reach that fruit at that higher branch a thousand years ago so we invented a tool that extended our reach who here could build this building with our bare hands but we created machines that extends and leverage out muscles we can now access all of human knowledge with a few keystrokes and we’re going to literally merge with this technology with ai to make us smarter it already does i mean these devices are brainextenders and people really think of it that way and that’s a new thing i mean people didn’t think of their smartphones that way just a few years ago they’ll literally go inside our bodies and brains but i think that’s an arbitrary distinction even though they’re outside our bodies and brains they’re already brain extenders and they will make us smarter and funnier laughterthompson well i could use some of that that’ll probably be five years agoso let’s talk about how to make this future go forward in the best way so we have an opportunity here you have 300 people who are going to be making some of the most important policy decisions i see people from tech companies here making big decisions at tech companies people in congress people in the white house people probably in foreign ministries explain the sort of—the framework for policymakers and how they should think about this accelerating technology what they should do and what they should not dokurzweil well i mean there has been a lot of focus on ai ethics now to keep the technology safe and it’s kind of a polarized discussion like a lot of discussions nowadays i’ve actually talked about both promise and peril for quite a long time started in the 1990s and did extensively in ’99 you might remember bill boy’s cover story in wiredthompson i wasn’t there at the timekurzweil right but that was a reflection on my book “age of spiritual machines” which had just come out talking about the great promise and peril and he focused on the peril and created quite a firestorm then 2006 chapter eight of “the singularity is near” is the deeply intertwined promise versus peril of gnr genetics nanotechnology and robotics technology has always been a doubleedged sword fire kept us warm cooked our food and burned down our houses these technologies are much more powerful it’s also a long discussion but i think we should go through three phases at least i did in contemplating this first is delight at the opportunity to overcome ageold afflictions—poverty disease and so on then alarm that these technologies can be destructive and cause even existential risksand finally i think where we need to come out is an appreciation that we have a moral imperative to continue progress in these technologies because despite the progress we’ve made—and that’s a whole ’nother issue people think things are getting worse but they’re actually getting better and we can talk about that but there’s still a lot of human suffering to be overcome it’s only continued progress particularly in ai that’s going to enable us to continue overcoming poverty and disease and environmental degradation while we attend to the peril and there’s a good framework for doing thatforty years ago—i alluded to this a moment ago—there were visionaries who saw both the promise and the peril of biotechnology basically reprogramming biology away from disease and aging neither of which was feasible 40 years ago so they held a conference called the asilomar conference at the conference center in asilomar they came up with ethical guidelines and strategies—how to keep these technologies safe so now it’s 40 years later we are getting clinical impact of biotechnology it’s a trickle today it’ll be a flood over the next decade the number of people who have been harmed either accidentally or intentionally by abuse of biotechnology so far has been zero that doesn’t mean we can cross it off our list—ok we took care of that one but it is—because we have to keep revising these guidelines because the technology keeps getting more sophisticated—but it’s a good model for how to proceed and we just had our first asilomar conference on the ai ethicsand a lot of these ethical guidelines—particularly in the case of say biotechnology—have been fashioned into law so i think that’s the goal it’s the first thing to understand the extremes are oh let’s band the technology let’s slow it down that’s really not the right approach let’s guide it in a constructive manner there are—there are strategies to do that that’s another complicated discussionthompson well let’s delve into that complicated discussion at least—at least for a minute or two what—you know you can imagine—you can imagine some rules that say congress could say that anybody working on a certain kind of technology has to make their data open right for example or has to be willing to share their data sets and at least to allow competitive markets over these incredibly powerful—these incredibly powerful tools you can imagine the government saying—actually there’ll be a big governmentfunded option and we’re going to have kind of like open ai but run by the government you can imagine a huge national infrastructure movement to build out this technology so at least people with public interest at heart have control over some of it what would you—what would you recommendkurzweil well i think open source data and algorithms in generally is a good idea google put all of its ai algorithms in the public domain with tensorflow which is opensource a lot of data is open source i think that’s a good direction to go in i think it’s really the combination of open source and the ongoing law of accelerating returns that will bring us closer and closer to the idealsi remember in fourth grade my social studies teacher put on the board “from each according to his ability to each according to his need” and he asked the class well what’s wrong with that and we said oh that’s great and he said well that’s the premise of communism and we were like oh my god is he a secret commie laughter but that is a good goal forced collectivism was a bad strategy laughter but i think we can get to that goal through a combination of open source and the ongoing exponential progress in both hardware and softwareso i think it’s a good direction to go in there are lots of issues such as privacy that are critical to maintain and i think people in this field are genuinely concerned about the issues there was a lot of representation by google in deepmind or at this asilomar conference it’s not clear what the right answers are i think we want to keep—continue the progress but when you have so much power even with good intentions there can be abusesthompson what worries you i mean your view of the future is very optimistic that’s very encouraging to hear but what worries youkurzweil well i’ve been accused of being an optimist and you have to be an optimist to be an entrepreneur because if you knew all the problems that you were going to encounter you’d probably never start any project laughter but i have as i say been concerned about written about the downsides which are existential we had the first existential risk to humanity when i was in grade school we would have these civil defense drills where we would get under our desks and put our hands behind our heads to protect us from the thermonuclear war and it worked laughterthompson mmm hmm it’s truekurzweil so we have—we have new existential risks these technologies are very powerful and so i do worry about that even though i’m an optimist and i’m optimistic that we’ll make it through i’m not as optimistic that there won’t be difficult episodes world war ii 50 million people died and that was certainty exacerbated by the power of technology at that time i think it’s important though for people to recognize we are making progress there was a poll taken of 24000 people in 26 countries recently and asked has poverty worldwide gotten better or worse ninety percent said incorrectly it’s gotten worse only 1 percent said correctly that it has fallen by 50 percent or more there’s a general pessimism that things are getting worse the world’s getting more violentso i said oh this is the most peaceful time human history and people seem to have—don’t you pay attention to the news because there was an incident a few days ago and a few days before that well our information about what’s wrong with the world is getting exponentially better and certainly it’s far from a perfect world but your chance of actually—steven pinker documents this in his book “the better angles of our nature” that there’s been an exponential decline in the likelihood of your being killed by interpersonal or statesponsored violence so that’s another long discussion but—thompson well assuming people are not going to be killed we’re going to have a qa in about five minutes so i’m going to ask you one more question which is about their futures which is what should they do right they’re about to enter a world where the career choices are career choices mapped onto a world with completely different technology so in your view what advice do you give to people in this roomkurzweil well it really is an old piece of advice which is to follow your passion because there’s really no area that’s not going to be affected or that isn’t a part of this story my father knew he had a passion for music from a very young age and music is relevant to this story the neocortex is a hierarchy of modules and we got an additional amount of neocortex 2 million year ago when we got these big foreheads and what we did with it is put it at the top of the neocortical hierarchy and that was the enabling factor for us to invent music every human culture ever discovered has music and no other animals have music humor came with that additional neocortex language art science technology magazines we’re going to do it again we’re going to merge with neocortex—simulated neocortex in the cloud so again we’ll be smarter and we’ll create new forms of communication that are as profound as music is try explaining music to an animal that doesn’t understand that conceptso everything is really relevant and it’s not going to—my view is not that ai is going to displace us it’s going to enhance us it does already i mean who can do their work without these brain extenders we have today and that’s going to continue to be the case and say oh only the wealthy are going to have these tools and i say yeah like smartphones of which there are 3 billion i just—i just—i was saying 2 billion but i just read the new statistic now it’s 3 billion it’ll be six billion in a couple years that’s because of this fantastic price performance explosion so these technologies—only the wealthy will be able to have these technologies at a point in time where they don’t work by the time they work well they’re virtually free laughterso you know find where you have a passion some people have complex passions that are not easily categorized and so find a way of contributing to the world that—where you think you can make a difference use the tools that are available the reason i came up with the law of accelerating returns literally was to time my own technology projects so i could start them a few years before they were feasible so try to anticipate where technology is going and it’s—people forget where we have come from i mean just a few years ago we had little devices that looked like a smartphone but they didn’t work very well so that revolution and mobile apps for example you know hardly existed five years ago the world will be comparably different in five years so try to time your projects to kind of meet the train at the stationthompson all right if council on foreign relations term members do not have questions for ray kurzweil i will eat my shoes and already we have half the front two rows laughter so right here please say—state your affiliation ask the question a reminder this meeting is on the record so your words can and will be used against youq so adedayo banwo deutsche bankwith all due respect sir you’re so smart it’s kind of scary laughter and i think the same holds true for the technology so i was wondering what sort of strategies do you envision for people in your spaces of explaining this and to make it less scary for normal peoplekurzweil well the unknown is scary so part of my mission is going to try to explain where we’re going and show how it has been beneficial we’ve overcome—i mean human life used to be extremely difficult if you want to read something scary read about life 200 years ago thomas hobbes describes it as short brutish disasterprone disease and poverty filled and there was no understanding of the germ theory of disease people got diseases all the time there was no antibiotics a routine infection would throw a family into economic desperation there were no social safety nets life expectancy was 37 in 1800 and even the kings and queens didn’t have amenities a century or two ago that the poor have today like flush toilets and refrigerators and radio tv computersso the future really will provide an opportunity to continue to overcome human affiliation and add to our creativity there’s a lot of fear about jobs but the movement has also been in the right direction if i were a prescient futurist in 1900 i’d say well 38 percent of you work on farms and 25 percent of you work in factories that’s twothirds of the population but i predict in 100 years that’ll be 2 percent on farms and 9 percent in factories and everybody would go oh my god we’re going to be out of work and i’d say don’t worry for every job we destroy at the bottom of the skill ladder we’re going to create more than one job at the top of the skill ladder and people would go oh great what new jobs and i’d say well i don’t know they haven’t been invented yet laughterwhich is part of the problem we can clearly see today—we can see even better because we have better communication and knowledge the jobs going away if you’re driving a truck or a car you’ve probably heard about selfdriving vehicles and we can’t see what’s coming if i were really prescient in 1900 i’d say well you’ll be creating websites and doing data analytics and apps for mobile devices and nobody would have any idea what i’m talking about so some economists say yes that’s all true but it’s slowed down in recent years that’s not true the whole mobile app economy which is many different ways to make money didn’t exist five years agoand so most importantly not everybody’s thrilled with their job but an increasing fraction of people actually get some of their selfidentification and gratification and selfactualization from their employment which wasn’t the case 100 years ago so i try to articulate the benefits and what we can see that’s positive about the futurethompson in the very front right here and i’d like to say and i’m glad we don’t all drop dead at 37 thank you ray laughterq hikurzweil well i gave a talk to junior high school kids—13 and 14yearold science winners from around the country and i said to them if it hadn’t been for the scientific progress we’ve made you all would be senior citizens because life expectancy was 19 1000 years agoq hi alana ackersonand i just did a doctorate looking at how the development of newer and better technology is a way that we as humans express faith in a better future for humanity and so from that lens i’d love to hear your thinking on—as we are now—as intelligence is now transcending us as humans in some ways what are your thoughts about how we are going to be redefining our understanding of who we are as humans and taking your phrase an age of spiritual machines how we are from a spiritual perspective so how is this going to fundamentally change you know our lens on these thingskurzweil right well great question we are the species that changes ourselves and changes who we are that came with that additional neocortex 2 million years ago and that we could then conceptualize different futures we had one other evolutionary change which is this modest appendage opposable thumbs so i could imagine i could take the branch and i could strip off the leaves and create a tool and then i had the dexterity to actually carry it out so we created a whole new evolutionary process of evolution of technologyyou mentioned spirituality i think this is all a spiritual process our theory is basically one of evolution so what do we see in evolution both biological evolution and technological evolution which is really a continuation of biological evolution—i have a chart showing the acceleration of change which goes very smoothly from biological to technological evolution it took hundreds of millions of years for mammals to evolve for example and now we have paradigm shifts in just a few years’ timebut what happens to entities in evolution they get more complicated they get more knowledgeable they get more creative they get more beautiful so if we look at how god has been described in different religious traditions—i grew up in a unitarian church where we studied all the world’s religions and there was a common theme although they all have different metaphors and different stories god was described as an ideal as being unlimited in what in those very same qualities—all knowing infinitely intelligent infinitely creative infinitely loving and so onand that—so we actually improved those very qualities at an exponential rate through an evolutionary process never achieving an infinite level but growing explosively in that direction so we never become god but we become more godlike in these various qualities so you could say that evolution is a spiritual process bringing us closer to godand the other implication that spiritual—and really where that title “age of spiritual machines” comes from—is what is this—what is spiritual it’s really a word for consciousness our whole moral system our sense of values is that consciousness is the precious thing that’s the sort of underlying debate in animal rights conscious entities are what’s important nonconscious entities are only important insofar as they affect the conscious experience of conscious entities so who and what are conscious is a key question and that’s the underlying question in animal rights that’ll be the question when it comes to the aiso i alluded to earlier we are going to merge with this technology i’d say we already have done that to some extent medical nanorobots will go inside our brain connect our neocortex to the cloud so your smartphone even though it is itself a billion times more powerful per dollar than the computer i used when i was an undergraduate at mit it multiples itself again a millionfold by connecting to millions of computers in the cloud we can’t do that directly from our neocortex we do it indirectly through these devices we’ll do it directly in the 2030s and not just to do things like search and translation directly from our brains although we’ll do that but to actually connect to more neocortexso it’ll be just like what happened 2 million years ago when we got these big foreheads and we got this additional neocortex and put it at the top of the hierarchy that was the enabling factor for humor and language music and so on we’ll do it again only unlike 2 million years ago it won’t be a oneshot deal we couldn’t keep growing this enclosure without making birth impossible the cloud is pure information technology it’s not limited by a fixed enclosure so we will become more and more nonbiologicalso people say oh we’re going to lose our humanity well if you define human as being necessarily purely biological i think we’re already not purely human anymore because we’re not purely biological anymore and we’re going to become increasingly nonbiological but that’s who we are i mean that is the definition of a human the species that changes itself it creates tools it goes beyond our limitationsthompson are there any conscious in the back of the room how about way back there in red dark hair yeah maybe you’re not in red butq thank you it’s more of a pink i think laughterthompson my glasses aren’t enhanced enough laughterq remo ph with senator dick durbin’s officethank you this was the most elegant description of the robots coming that i have ever heard and i am just curious you know so much of the emphasis has been on sort of the really lovely side of human nature on science and exploration and i’m curious as we sort of move more towards our robot partners what about the dark side what about war and war machines and violence i think already in some early ai experiments there has been this issue of sort of when you take the internet in aggregate there is you know sort of a hostility or negative in verbiage that is put into the—you know put into some of these machines and you know what is—i guess what is your thinking on that or what is the reaction or what are the controls for that and i asked as someone—i’m an optimist and i just i think—at least from sitting in washington—one of the worries about this is you know how do you—how do you filter for that and we haven’t even been able to answer that question for the internet yetkurzweil yeah well let me come back to what i think can be done about that but just to make an overriding point that the increase in communications i think has fostered democracy and peace so that started with books in the middle ages and then we had other forms of communication you can count the number of democracies a century ago on the fingers of one hand you could count the number of democracies two centuries on the fingers of one finger the world is not a perfect democracy today but that has been accepted as the ideal and people at least argue as to how they are a democracy that’s become the model that wasn’t the case a century ago there wasn’t that consensusand the world has become more peaceful as i just mentioned and there’s a lot of documentation on that doesn’t appear to be the case because our information about what’s wrong with the world is getting exponentially better and there’s actually an evolutionary preference for bad news because it was actually in your interest you know tens of thousands of years ago for you to pay attention to bad news a little rustling in the leaves that might be a predator that was important to pay attention to the fact that your crops were 1 percent better than last year that was not critical for your survival for you to be aware ofthat being said you know we’re learning a lot about how these platforms can be used to amplify all kinds of human inclinations and be manipulated and a lot of this is fairly recent information that we’re learning but we can—so ai learns from examples there’s a motto in the field that life begins at a billion examples and the best way to get examples is to learn from people so ai very often learns from people not always alphago zero just learned from itself by playing go games against itself but that’s not always feasible particularly when you’re trying to deal with more complex realworld issuesthere’s a major effort in the field—it’s going on in all the major companies and in opensource research as wellto debias ai because it’s going to pick up biases from people if it’s learning from people and people have biases and so to overcome gender bias and other types of—racial bias that can actually be a goal as humans we pick up biases from all of the things we’ve seen a lot of it’s subconscious we then learn as educated humans to recognize bias and try to overcome it and we can have conflicts within our own minds the metaphor that my mentor marvin minsky used in the title of his book “society of mind” i think is a good one because i very often hear the society of my own mind bickering about some issue and there’s different factions for different issuesbut there is a whole area of research to debias ai and to overcome the biases it may pick up from people so that’s one type of research that can overcome problems with machine intelligence and in these ways machine intelligence you know can be actually less bias than the humans that it learned from overall though i think despite the promise and peril that’s intertwined in social media it’s overall been a very beneficial thing i walk through airports and every child over the age of two is on their devices and it’s become a world community and i think the generation now growing up more so than any other generation feels that they are citizens of the world because they’re really in touch with all the cultures of the worldthompson right here in the front adamq adam ghetti with ionic securityray really appreciate all the work you keep doing on singularity but i do want to leap forward to 2030 timeframe we’ve got the nanobots we’re connected you know i’ve got a collective set of kind of thought and almost infinite capacity comparative to where are todaykurzweil that won’t be till 2035q all right 2035 we’re there that happens and kind on the same progression of more information has created more peace better kind of understanding of a global community versus these isolated communities when we have the ability to have that kind of much higher bandwidth access to this extraordinary processing and intelligence infrastructure does that deeper appreciation now of everybody else and every other culture because we have the bandwidth to absorb it and process it what are the implications you see on nationstate structures and global governing structures when the world is truly connected that waykurzweil i mean we are already part of the way there you know there’s some issue the retirement funds in italy and the whole world is not only aware of it but it affects everyone so we are not isolated islands and haven’t been that way for a long time and there’s appreciation how pieces issues of economics or our affairs anywhere in the world have an immediate effect on us it’s not just that we care about these other peopleand you know old institutions continue there are still horses and buggies not far from here there’s still mechanical typewriters religion is still an institution but has much less effect than it did say a century ago it wasn’t that long ago in human history that it really governed and had deep influence on every facet of everyone’s life it now has a role that varies depending on the person but it’s a much less pervasive force the same thing’s true of nationstates i mean people really are increasingly identifying as citizens of the world and i think over time nationstates will becomes less influential i mean i think we’re on that paththompson wait can i just—in the last year in this country we have not grown closer to the rest of the world i know a lot of people would say our democracy has not gotten better is this a blip in the ongoing continuing progress and mankind coming together or is this—or are many people misinterpreting thatkurzweil well i mean the polarization in politics in the united states and in some other places in the world is unfortunate i don’t think it is an issue for the kinds of things that we’ve been talking about today we’ve had you know major blips in the world world war ii was a pretty big blip and actually didn’t affect these trends at all i mean one of the remarkable things i noted in ’81 when i first noticed this is where is world war ii or world war i on these graphs so it kind of has a mind of its own and there may be things that we don’t like in say certain government officials or the government but there’s very robust discussion we’re not in a totalitarian era where you can’t voice your views i’d be more concerned if we moved in that direction but i don’t see that happeningso not to diminish the importance of government and who’s in power and so forth but it’s at a different level the kinds of issues we’re talking about are not really affected by these issues there are existential risks that i worry about that i mentioned because technology is a doubleedged swordthompson on the far leftq hi aubrey hruby africa expertand my question is about inequality from a human history perspective maybe we started out very equal and hunter and gatherer but there were a lot of phases of most of human history where inequality is quite high and i’m wondering whether you think that the 20th century was an anomaly in that sense and how the diffusion of technology is going to impact inequality if you look at gini coefficients worldwidekurzweil well i think there’s been a worldwide movement towards greater equality ancient societies were not equal first of all gender roles were very rigid and there was no concept of gender equality my own family’s been involved in this my daughter’s right here but my great grandmother started the first school in europe that provided higher education for girls in 1868 taken over by her daughter who became the first woman to get a phd in chemistry and wrote about this the title of her book is “one life is not enough” which kind of presaged my interest in life extension but if you talk about gender equality you’ve come a long waybut there’s all kinds of issues i mean slavery was considered the norm certainly here in the united states but around the world not that long ago in human history and there’s been you know recent issues with gay rights and gay marriage and there’s a continual progression i think of human rights this unitarian church i grew up in one motto was “many paths to the truth” so we studied all the world religious traditions but they were also focused on the here and now and civil liberties and we went to civil rights marches in the south in the 1950s so i think we are making progress i mean there wasn’t even discussion of these issues not that long ago i mean when i was—q off mic—economic inequality from like a global perspectivekurzweil economic equality is getting better poverty in asia has fallen by over 90 percent according to the world bank in the last 20 years they’ve gone from primitive agrarian economies to thriving information economies africa and south america have growth rates that are substantially higher than the developed world so any snapshot you take there’s inequality but it’s dramatically moving in the right direction poverty worldwide has fallen 50 percent in the last 20 years and there’s many other measures of thatpeople say the digital divide but you know the internet smart phones are very strong in africa that’s a change just in the last few years so we’re moving in the right direction at any one point in time there’s grave inequality and people who are suffering but the numbers are growing in the right directionthompson in the far very far back last man against the wallq hi my name is lester malpin phi guess my question is a question very generic that you probably get asked every day and i’m the father of four kids so i think about it all the time and that is really why—we have people like yourself but in our country why do we pour—why do we score so poorly in stem why do you think that happens and what do you think is the answer to that because i’m trying to get my kids prepared for 2035kurzweil well it’s an interesting dichotomy we do on various measures fall behind on stem there’s still a gender issue with stem the girls are right up there with the boys up through junior high school but then they tend to drop out and we don’t fully understand the reasons for that there seem to be powerful cultural issues at work and people are working on overcoming that but we don’t fully understand itbut despite all that the united states leads in stem i mean the most—the leading hightech companies are american certainly other countries like china are moving rapidly but we do have kind of an entrepreneurial leadership there’s a frontier mentality that comes from the united states being a place that you went to overcome oppression and to seek a better life that is i think engrained in the american characterand also we are the land of all the world’s peoples so we understand all the different markets around the world because all those people are here and that’s what makes up america that’s not true of most other countries there’s some diversity in some countries but nothing like the united statesi do think stem literacy scientific technological digital literacy should be an important part of education it’s shocking to me that many high schools don’t have—don’t teach computer software they should be teaching programming in elementary school it’s a good way to think it’s a good way to develop intellectual skills and a good way to view the worldso i think this is a good thing for us to focus on as a nation we’re doing well in stem i think just to be a world citizen it’s important to actually have literacy in these areasthompson right there in the middleq adam pearlman with the us courtstaking your hypothesis of you know a connected collective consciousness maybe—maybe collective maybe not—what does that do to individuality comparative advantage on an individual level and the concept of leadership if we’re all connected through implants or anything elsekurzweil well yeah people—another way of asking that is aren’t we going to all become the same if we all have access to all this knowledge and thinking capacity i think we’ll actually become more different we’re actually pretty much the same as you know unenhanced we all have a very similar architecture of 300 million neocortical modules so fixed capacity we’ll be able to delve much more deeply into specific issues or skills or areas of insight as we enhance our thinking capacity and we can do that already to the extent that we have these brain extendersit was very hard to write a book 30 years ago my most important information technology was a roll of quarters to feed the copier in the public library so we do have the ability to think more deeply so people will—i mean we already see a tremendous diversity for example of musical feelings i mean when i was a kid there was pop music and there was jazz and classical music and that was it and now there’s hundreds of genres so that will continue there will be a tremendous diversity of ways you can approach subjects and i think people will become more different when they have more capacity to think more deeplythompson right back here in the front row last question because time always moves exponentially at the end of these and so we are out of itq jaime yassif from the open philanthropy project thank you for coming to speak with us todayi hear from your remarks that you’re making a prediction that artificial general intelligence is 12 years out and you’ve mentioned a couple of times that notwithstanding your optimism you are concerned somewhat about existential risks so i was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on what you mean by that and what is the most important thing that you think technologists should be doing to reduce those riskskurzweil well i mean existential risks are risks that threaten the survival of our civilization so the first existential risk that humanity ever faced was nuclear proliferation we have had the ability to destroy all of humanity some number of times over there’s debate about what that number is but it doesn’t really matterand these new technologies it’s not hard to come up with scenarios where they could be highly destructive or destroy all of humanity so biotechnology for example we have the ability to reprogram biology away from disease immunotherapy for example which is a very exciting breakthrough in cancer i think it’s going to be quite revolutionary it’s just getting started that’s reprogramming the immune system to go after cancer which it normally doesn’t dobut a bioterrorist could reprogram a virus to be more deadly and more communicable and more stealthy and create a superweapon and that was the specter that spawned this first asilomar conference 40 years ago and there’s been recurring conferences to make these ethical guidelines and safety protocols and strategies more sophisticated and so far it’s worked but we keep making the technology more sophisticated so we have to you know reinvent them over and over againso we just had our first asilomar conference on ai ethics we came up with a set of ethics which we all signed off on a lot of them are somewhat vague i think if you look back at the asilomar guidelines for biotech 40 years ago it was the same thing they’ve gotten more teeth and more specificity and more significance over timei think it’s an important issue to give a high priority to you know there’s—we’re finding we have to build ethical values into software a classic example is your selfdriving car the whole motive—the whole motive for selfdriving cars is they’ll you know they’ll eliminate 99 percent of the 2 million deaths a year from human drivers but it will get into a situation where it has to make an ethical decision should it drive towards the baby carriage or towards the elderly couple or towards the wall and perhaps kill your passenger do you have an ethical guideline to your passenger when i own you you can’t send an email to the software designers in that circumstance of gee what should i do it’s got to be built into the software so those are practical issues and there’s a whole area of ai ethics growing over thisbut how do we deal with the more existential risks weaponization of ai which is not something in the future i mean defense departments all around the world have been applying ai there was a document going around asking people to agree to ban autonomous weapons which sounds like a good idea and the example that’s used is well we banned chemical weapons so why not autonomous ai weapons it’s a little more complicated because you know we can get by without anthrax and without small pox it’s ok to just ban them but autonomous—an autonomous weapon is a dualuse technology the amazon drone that’s delivering your frozen waffles or medicine to a hospital in africa could be delivering a weapon it’s the same technology and kind of the horse is already out of the barn which is just to say that it’s a more complicated issue how to deal with that but the goal is to reap the promise and control the perilthere’s no simple sort of algorithms there’s no little subroutine we can put in our ai as ok put this subroutine in and it will keep your ais benign there are technical strategies when it comes to biotechnology and nanotechnology but intelligence is inherently uncontrollable you know if there’s some entity that’s more powerful than you and i and it’s out for our destruction the best strategy is not to get in that situation in the first place and failing that the best next strategy would be to get some other ai that’s even more intelligent than the one that’s out for you on your side laughter intelligence is inherently uncontrollableso my strategy which is not foolproof is to practice the kind of ethics and morality and values we’d like to see in the world in our own human society because future society ssa it’s not some invasion from mars of intelligent machines it’s going to—it is emerging from our civilization today it’s going to be an enhancement of who we are and so if we’re practicing the kind of values we cherish in our world today that’s the best strategy to have for a world in the future that embodies those valuesthompson all right that is the perfect note to end on we will all go now to an autonomous weaponfree cocktail receptionthank you very much ray kurzweil applauseendclimate changea global

donateinternet technologyreportby aaron smith and janna andersonthe vast majority of respondents to the 2014 future of the internet canvassing anticipate that robotics and artificial intelligence will permeate wide segments of daily life by 2025 with huge implications for a range of industries such as health care transport and logistics customer service and home maintenance but even as they are largely consistent in their predictions for the evolution of technology itself they are deeply divided on how advances in ai and robotics will impact the economic and employment picture over the next decadewe call this a canvassing because it is not a representative randomized survey its findings emerge from an “opt in” invitation to experts who have been identified by researching those who are widely quoted as technology builders and analysts and those who have made insightful predictions to our previous queries about the future of the internet for more details please see the section “about this report and survey”some 1896 experts responded to the following questionthe economic impact of robotic advances and ai—selfdriving cars intelligent digital agents that can act for you and robots are advancing rapidly will networked automated artificial intelligence ai applications and robotic devices have displaced more jobs than they have created by 2025half of these experts 48 envision a future in which robots and digital agents have displaced significant numbers of both blue and whitecollar workers—with many expressing concern that this will lead to vast increases in income inequality masses of people who are effectively unemployable and breakdowns in the social orderthe other half of the experts who responded to this survey 52 expect that technology will not displace more jobs than it creates by 2025 to be sure this group anticipates that many jobs currently performed by humans will be substantially taken over by robots or digital agents by 2025 but they have faith that human ingenuity will create new jobs industries and ways to make a living just as it has been doing since the dawn of the industrial revolutionthese two groups also share certain hopes and concerns about the impact of technology on employment for instance many are concerned that our existing social structures—and especially our educational institutions—are not adequately preparing people for the skills that will be needed in the job market of the future conversely others have hope that the coming changes will be an opportunity to reassess our society’s relationship to employment itself—by returning to a focus on smallscale or artisanal modes of production or by giving people more time to spend on leisure selfimprovement or time with loved onesa number of themes ran through the responses to this question those that are unique to either group and those that were mentioned by members of both groupsjp rangaswami chief scientist for salesforcecom offered a number of reasons for his belief that automation will not be a net displacer of jobs in the next decade “the effects will be different in different economies which themselves may look different from today’s political boundaries driven by revolutions in education and in technology the very nature of work will have changed radically—but only in economies that have chosen to invest in education technology and related infrastructure some classes of jobs will be handed over to the ‘immigrants’ of ai and robotics but more will have been generated in creative and curating activities as demand for their services grows exponentially while barriers to entry continue to fall for many classes of jobs robots will continue to be poor labor substitutes”rangaswami’s prediction incorporates a number of arguments made by those in this canvassing who took his side of this questionvint cerf vice president and chief internet evangelist for google said historically technology has created more jobs than it destroys and there is no reason to think otherwise in this case someone has to make and service all these advanced devices”jonathan grudin principal researcher for microsoft concurred “technology will continue to disrupt jobs but more jobs seem likely to be created when the world population was a few hundred million people there were hundreds of millions of jobs although there have always been unemployed people when we reached a few billion people there were billions of jobs there is no shortage of things that need to be done and that will not change”michael kende the economist for a major internetoriented nonprofit organization wrote “in general every wave of automation and computerization has increased productivity without depressing employment and there is no reason to think the same will not be true this time in particular the new wave is likely to increase our personal or professional productivity eg selfdriving car but not necessarily directly displace a job eg chauffeur while robots may displace some manual jobs the impact should not be different than previous waves of automation in factories and elsewhere on the other hand someone will have to code and build the new tools which will also likely lead to a new wave of innovations and jobs”fred baker internet pioneer longtime leader in the ietf and cisco systems fellow responded “my observation of advances in automation has been that they change jobs but they don’t reduce them a car that can guide itself on a striped street has more difficulty with an unstriped street for example and any automated system can handle events that it is designed for but not events such as a child chasing a ball into a street for which it is not designed yes i expect a lot of change i dont think the human race can retire en masse by 2025”ben shneiderman professor of computer science at the university of maryland wrote “robots and ai make compelling stories for journalists but they are a false vision of the major economic changes journalists lost their jobs because of changes to advertising professors are threatened by moocs and store salespeople are losing jobs to internet sales people improved user interfaces electronic delivery videos music etc and more selfreliant customers reduce job needs at the same time someone is building new websites managing corporate social media plans creating new products etc improved user interfaces novel services and fresh ideas will create more jobs”amy webb ceo of strategy firm webbmedia group wrote “there is a general concern that the robots are taking over i disagree that our emerging technologies will permanently displace most of the workforce though i’d argue that jobs will shift into other sectors now more than ever an army of talented coders is needed to help our technology advance but we will still need folks to do packaging assembly sales and outreach the collar of the future is a hoodie”john markoff senior writer for the science section of the new york times responded “you didn’t allow the answer that i feel strongly is accurate—too hard to predict there will be a vast displacement of labor over the next decade that is true but if we had gone back 15 years who would have thought that ‘search engine optimization’ would be a significant job category”marjory blumenthal a science and technology policy analyst wrote “in a given context automated devices like robots may displace more than they create but they also generate new categories of work giving rise to second and thirdorder effects also there is likely to be more humanrobot collaboration—a change in the kind of work opportunities available the wider impacts are the hardest to predict they may not be strictly attributable to the uses of automation but they are related…what the middle of the 20th century shows us is how dramatic major economic changes are—like the 1970s opecdriven increases of the price of oil—and how those changes can dwarf the effects of technology”a number of respondents argued that many jobs require uniquely human characteristics such as empathy creativity judgment or critical thinking—and that jobs of this nature will never succumb to widespread automationdavid hughes a retired us army colonel who from 1972 was a pioneer in individual tofrom digital telecommunications responded “for all the automation and ai i think the human hand will have to be involved on a large scale just as aircraft have to have pilots and copilots i don’t think all ‘selfdriving’ cars will be totally unmanned the human’s ability to detect unexpected circumstances and take action overriding automatic driving will be needed as long and individually owned ‘cars’ are on the road”pamela rutledge phd and director of the media psychology research center responded “there will be many things that machines can’t do such as services that require thinking creativity synthesizing problemsolving and innovating…advances in ai and robotics allow people to cognitively offload repetitive tasks and invest their attention and energy in things where humans can make a difference we already have cars that talk to us a phone we can talk to robots that lift the elderly out of bed and apps that remind us to call mom an app can dial moms number and even send flowers but an app cant do that most human of all things emotionally connect with her”michael glassman associate professor at the ohio state university wrote “i think ai will do a few more things but people are going to be surprised how limited it is there will be greater differentiation between what ai does and what humans do but also much more realization that ai will not be able to engage the critical tasks that humans do”another group of experts feels that the impact on employment is likely to be minimal for the simple reason that 10 years is too short a timeframe for automation to move substantially beyond the factory floor david clark a senior research scientist at mit’s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory noted “the larger trend to consider is the penetration of automation into service jobs this trend will require new skills for the service industry which may challenge some of the lowertier workers but in 12 years i do not think autonomous devices will be truly autonomous i think they will allow us to deliver a higher level of service with the same level of human involvement”jari arkko internet expert for ericsson and chair of the internet engineering task force wrote “there is no doubt that these technologies affect the types of jobs that need to be done but there are only 12 years to 2025 some of these technologies will take a long time to deploy in significant scale… we’ve been living a relatively slow but certain progress in these fields from the 1960s”christopher wilkinson a retired european union official board member for eurideu and internet society leader said “the vast majority of the population will be untouched by these technologies for the foreseeable future ai and robotics will be a niche with a few leading applications such as banking retailing and transport the risks of error and the imputation of liability remain major constraints to the application of these technologies to the ordinary landscape”a final group suspects that economic political and social concerns will prevent the widespread displacement of jobs glenn edens a director of research in networking security and distributed systems within the computer science laboratory at parc a xerox company wrote “there are significant technical and policy issues yet to resolve however there is a relentless march on the part of commercial interests businesses to increase productivity so if the technical advances are reliable and have a positive roi then there is a risk that workers will be displaced ultimately we need a broad and large base of employed population otherwise there will be no one to pay for all of this new world”andrew rens chief council at the shuttleworth foundation wrote “a fundamental insight of economics is that an entrepreneur will only supply goods or services if there is a demand and those who demand the good can pay therefore any country that wants a competitive economy will ensure that most of its citizens are employed so that in turn they can pay for goods and services if a country doesn’t ensure employment driven demand it will become increasingly less competitive”geoff livingston author and president of tenacity5 media wrote “i see the movement towards ai and robotics as evolutionary in large part because it is such a sociological leap the technology may be ready but we are not—at least not yet”an equally large group of experts takes a diametrically opposed view of technology’s impact on employment in their reading of history job displacement as a result of technological advancement is clearly in evidence today and can only be expected to get worse as automation comes to the whitecollar worldjerry michalski founder of rex the relationship economy expedition sees the logic of the slow and unrelenting movement in the direction of more automation “automation is voldemort the terrifying force nobody is willing to name oh sure we talk about it now and then but usually in passing we hardly dwell on the fact that someone trying to pick a career path that is not likely to be automated will have a very hard time making that choice xray technician outsourced already and automation in progress the race between automation and human work is won by automation and as long as we need fiat currency to pay the rentmortgage humans will fall out of the system in droves as this shift takes place…the safe zones are services that require local human effort gardening painting babysitting distant human effort editing coaching coordinating and highlevel thinkingrelationship building everything else falls in the targetrich environment of automation”mike roberts internet pioneer and hall of fame member and longtime leader with icann and the internet society shares this view “electronic human avatars with substantial work capability are years not decades away the situation is exacerbated by total failure of the economics community to address to any serious degree sustainability issues that are destroying the modern ‘consumerist’ model and undermining the early 20th century notion of ‘a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work’ there is great pain down the road for everyone as new realities are addressed the only question is how soon”robert cannon internet law and policy expert predicts “everything that can be automated will be automated nonskilled jobs lacking in ‘human contribution’ will be replaced by automation when the economics are favorable at the hardware store the guy who used to cut keys has been replaced by a robot in the law office the clerks who used to prepare discovery have been replaced by software ibm watson is replacing researchers by reading every report ever written anywhere this begs the question what can the human contribute the short answer is that if the job is one where that question cannot be answered positively that job is not likely to exist”tom standage digital editor for the economist makes the point that the next wave of technology is likely to have a more profound impact than those that came before it “previous technological revolutions happened much more slowly so people had longer to retrain and also moved people from one kind of unskilled work to another robots and ai threaten to make even some kinds of skilled work obsolete eg legal clerks this will displace people into service roles and the income gap between skilled workers whose jobs cannot be automated and everyone else will widen this is a recipe for instability”mark nall a program manager for nasa noted “unlike previous disruptions such as when farming machinery displaced farm workers but created factory jobs making the machines robotics and ai are different due to their versatility and growing capabilities not just a few economic sectors will be affected but whole swaths will be this is already being seen now in areas from robocalls to lightsout manufacturing economic efficiency will be the driver the social consequence is that goodpaying jobs will be increasingly scarcefor those who expect ai and robotics to significantly displace human employment these displacements seem certain to lead to an increase in income inequality a continued hollowing out of the middle class and even riots social unrest andor the creation of a permanent unemployable “underclass”justin reich a fellow at harvard university’s berkman center for internet society said “robots and ai will increasingly replace routine kinds of work—even the complex routines performed by artisans factory workers lawyers and accountants there will be a labor market in the service sector for nonroutine tasks that can be performed interchangeably by just about anyone—and these will not pay a living wage—and there will be some new opportunities created for complex nonroutine work but the gains at this top of the labor market will not be offset by losses in the middle and gains of terrible jobs at the bottom i’m not sure that jobs will disappear altogether though that seems possible but the jobs that are left will be lower paying and less secure than those that exist now the middle is moving to the bottom”stowe boyd lead researcher at gigaom research said “as just one aspect of the rise of robots and ai widespread use of autonomous cars and trucks will be the immediate end of taxi drivers and truck drivers truck driver is the numberone occupation for men in the us just as importantly autonomous cars will radically decrease car ownership which will impact the automotive industry perhaps 70 of cars in urban areas would go away autonomous robots and systems could impact up to 50 of jobs according to recent analysis by frey and osborne at oxford leaving only jobs that require the ‘application of heuristics’ or creativity…an increasing proportion of the world’s population will be outside of the world of work—either living on the dole or benefiting from the dramatically decreased costs of goods to eke out a subsistence lifestyle the central question of 2025 will be what are people for in a world that does not need their labor and where only a minority are needed to guide the botbased economy”nilofer merchant author of a book on new forms of advantage wrote “just today the guy who drives the service car i take to go to the airport said that he does this job because his last bluecollar job disappeared from automation driverless cars displace him where does he go what does he do for society the gaps between the haves and havenots will grow larger i’m reminded of the line from henry ford who understood he does no good to his business if his own people can’t afford to buy the car”alex howard a writer and editor based in washington dc said “i expect that automation and ai will have had a substantial impact on whitecollar jobs particularly backoffice functions in clinics in law firms like medical secretaries transcriptionists or paralegals governments will have to collaborate effectively with technology companies and academic institutions to provide massive retraining efforts over the next decade to prevent massive social disruption from these changes”a consistent theme among both groups is that our existing social institutions—especially the educational system—are not up to the challenge of preparing workers for the technology and roboticscentric nature of employment in the futurehoward rheingold a pioneering internet sociologist and selfemployed writer consultant and educator noted “the jobs that the robots will leave for humans will be those that require thought and knowledge in other words only the besteducated humans will compete with machines and education systems in the us and much of the rest of the world are still sitting students in rows and columns teaching them to keep quiet and memorize what is told to them preparing them for life in a 20th century factory”bryan alexander technology consultant futurist and senior fellow at the national institute for technology in liberal education wrote “the education system is not well positioned to transform itself to help shape graduates who can ‘race against the machines’ not in time and not at scale autodidacts will do well as they always have done but the broad masses of people are being prepared for the wrong economy”on a more hopeful note a number of experts expressed a belief that the coming changes will allow us to renegotiate the existing social compact around work and employmenthal varian chief economist for google envisions a future with fewer ‘jobs’ but a more equitable distribution of labor and leisure time “if ‘displace more jobs’ means ‘eliminate dull repetitive and unpleasant work’ the answer would be yes how unhappy are you that your dishwasher has replaced washing dishes by hand your washing machine has displaced washing clothes by hand or your vacuum cleaner has replaced hand cleaning my guess is this ‘job displacement’ has been very welcome as will the ‘job displacement’ that will occur over the next 10 years the work week has fallen from 70 hours a week to about 37 hours now and i expect that it will continue to fall this is a good thing everyone wants more jobs and less work robots of various forms will result in less work but the conventional work week will decrease so there will be the same number of jobs adjusted for demographics of course this is what has been going on for the last 300 years so i see no reason that it will stop in the decade”tiffany shlain filmmaker host of the aol series the future starts here and founder of the webby awards responded “robots that collaborate with humans over the cloud will be in full realization by 2025 robots will assist humans in tasks thus allowing humans to use their intelligence in new ways freeing us up from menial tasks”francoisdominique armingaud retired computer software engineer from ibm and now giving security courses to major engineering schools responded “the main purpose of progress now is to allow people to spend more life with their loved ones instead of spoiling it with overtime while others are struggling in order to access work”a notable number of experts take it for granted that many of tomorrow’s jobs will be held by robots or digital agents—and express hope that this will inspire us as a society to completely redefine our notions of work and employmentpeter and trudy johnsonlenz founders of the online community awakening technology based in portland oregon wrote “many things need to be done to care for teach feed and heal others that are difficult to monetize if technologies replace people in some jobs and roles what kinds of social support or safety nets will make it possible for them to contribute to the common good through other means think outside the job”bob frankston an internet pioneer and technology innovator whose work helped allow people to have control of the networking internet within their homes wrote “we’ll need to evolve the concept of a job as a means of wealth distribution as we did in response to the invention of the sewing machine displacing seamstressing as welfare”jim hendler an architect of the evolution of the world wide web and professor of computer science at rensselaer polytechnic institute wrote “the notion of work as a necessity for life cannot be sustained if the great bulk of manufacturing and such moves to machines—but humans will adapt by finding new models of payment as they did in the industrial revolution after much upheaval”tim bray an active participant in the ietf and technology industry veteran wrote “it seems inevitable to me that the proportion of the population that needs to engage in traditional fulltime employment in order to keep us fed supplied healthy and safe will decrease i hope this leads to a humane restructuring of the general social contract around employment”another group of experts anticipates that pushback against expanding automation will lead to a revolution in smallscale artisanal and handmade modes of productionkevin carson a senior fellow at the center for a stateless society and contributor to the p2p foundation blog wrote “i believe the concept of ‘jobs’ and ‘employment’ will be far less meaningful because the main direction of technological advance is toward cheap production tools eg desktop information processing tools or opensource cnc garage machine tools that undermine the material basis of the wage system the real change will not be the stereotypical model of ‘technological unemployment’ with robots displacing workers in the factories but increased employment in small shops increased projectbased work on the construction industry model and increased provisioning in the informal and household economies and production for gift sharing and barter”tony siesfeld director of the monitor institute wrote “i anticipate that there will be a backlash and we’ll see a continued growth of artisanal products and smallscale efforts done myself or with a small group of others that reject robotics and digital technology”a network scientist for bbn technologies wrote “to some degree this is already happening in terms of the largescale massproduced economy the utility of lowskill human workers is rapidly diminishing as many bluecollar jobs eg in manufacturing and whitecollar jobs eg processing insurance paperwork can be handled much more cheaply by automated systems and we can already see some hints of reaction to this trend in the current economy entrepreneuriallyminded unemployed and underemployed people are taking advantages of sites like etsy and taskrabbit to market quintessentially human skills and in response there is increasing demand for ‘artisanal’ or ‘handcrafted’ products that were made by a human in the long run this trend will actually push toward the relocalization and rehumanization of the economy with the 19th and 20thcentury economies of scale exploited where they make sense cheap identical disposable goods and humanoriented techniques both older and newer increasingly accounting for goods and services that are valuable customized or longlasting”in the end a number of these experts took pains to note that none of these potential outcomes—from the most utopian to most dystopian—are etched in stone although technological advancement often seems to take on a mind of its own humans are in control of the political social and economic systems that will ultimately determine whether the coming wave of technological change has a positive or negative impact on jobs and employmentseth finkelstein a programmer consultant and eff pioneer of the electronic frontier award winner responded “the technodeterministnegative view that automation means jobs loss end of story versus the technodeterministpositive view that more and better jobs will result both seem to me to make the error of confusing potential outcomes with inevitability thus a technological advance by itself can either be positive or negative for jobs depending on the social structure as a whole…this is not a technological consequence rather it’s a political choice”jason pontin editor in chief and publisher of the mit technology review responded “there’s no economic law that says the jobs eliminated by new technologies will inevitably be replaced by new jobs in new markets… all of this is manageable by states and economies but it will require wrestling with ideologically fraught solutions such as a guaranteed minimum income and a broadening of our social sense of what is valuable work”fact tank01172019fact tank09062018fact tank11282018internet tech03012018social trends011720191615 l st nw suite

'the most common answer that one expects is “to make computers intelligent so that they can act intelligently” but the question is how much intelligent how can one judge the intelligence…as intelligent as humans if the computers can somehow solve realworld problems by improving on their own from the past experiences they would be called “intelligent” thus the ai systems are more genericrather than specific have the ability to “think” and are more flexibleintelligence as we know is the ability to acquire and apply the knowledge knowledge is the information acquired through experience experience is the knowledge gained through exposuretraining summing the terms up we get artificial intelligence as the “copy of something naturalie human beings ‘who’ is capable of acquiring and applying the information it has gained through exposure”intelligence is composed ofmany tools are used in ai including versions of search and mathematical optimization logic methods based on probability and economics the ai field draws upon computer science mathematics psychology linguistics philosophy neuroscience artificial psychology and many othersneed for artificial intelligenceapplications of ai include natural language processing gaming speech recognition vision systems healthcare automotive etcan ai system is composed of an agent and its environment an agenteg human or robot is anything that can perceive its environment through sensors and acts upon that environment through effectors intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them in classical planning problems the agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world allowing the agent to be certain of the consequences of its actions however if the agent is not the only actor then it requires that the agent can reason under uncertainty this calls for an agent that cannot only assess its environment and make predictions but also evaluate its predictions and adapt based on its assessment natural language processing gives machines the ability to read and understand human language some straightforward applications of natural language processing include information retrieval text mining question answering and machine translation machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors such as cameras microphones sensors etc to deduce aspects of the world eg computer vision concepts such as game theory decision theory necessitate that an agent be able to detect and model human emotionsmany times students get confused between machine learning and artificial intelligence but machine learning a fundamental concept of ai research since the field’s inception is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience the mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as a computational learning theorystuart shapiro divides ai research into three approaches which he calls computational psychology computational philosophy and computer science computational psychology is used to make computer programs that mimic human behavior computational philosophy is used to develop an adaptive freeflowing computer mind implementing computer science serves the goal of creating computers that can perform tasks that only people could previously accomplishai has developed a large number of tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science likehighprofile examples of ai include autonomous vehicles such as drones and selfdriving cars medical diagnosis creating art such as poetry proving mathematical theorems playing games such as chess or go search engines such as google search online assistants such as siri image recognition in photographs spam filtering prediction of judicial decisions204 and targeting online advertisements other applications include healthcare automotive finance video games etcare there limits to how intelligent machines – or humanmachine hybrids – can be a superintelligence hyperintelligence or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind ‘’superintelligence’’ may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agentreferences

of the students around them robots at carnegie mellon university are constantly learning — learning how to think how to move and how to be more like humansits sort of this wonderland of innovation says 60 minutes producer nichole marks in the video above everywhere you go every corner of the campus there are robots robots in the hallways robots picking things up robots talking to youmarks and correspondent charlie rose visited the carnegie mellon campus in pittsburgh while reporting their twopart story on artificial intelligence or ai for this weeks episode of 60 minutes what they found in the old steel town was a glimpse into the future says rose and its a future where ai may enable robots to take on both the mundane and the extraordinarythe 60 minutes team explored the campus robotics and artificial intelligence labs with former google vp andrew moore who now runs the carnegie mellons school of computer science moore says his goal is to nurture the next generation of computer scientists who could change the world through innovationwhen youre programming a robot its like magic moore tells rose and so the thing i tell middle schoolers is the closest thing to getting to go to hogwarts is being able to do robotics and aithe autonomous robots in carnegie mellons labs may seem magical but many of them have very practical applications in the video above moore shows the 60 minutes team robots that could assist humans in military operations disaster response scenarios and fields that range from archeology to domestic serviceone of the projects the 60 minutes team saw at carnegie mellon is an autonomous tank called the land tamer which can operate without human intervention on the battlefield the us army sponsored a test run of the vehicle last year that demonstrated how land tamer could be dropped into dangerous situations by a selfflying helicopter no less and then achieve its mission on the ground independently without putting soldiers in harms waythe 60 minutes team also met chimp or cmu highly intelligent mobile platform a robot intended to perform tasks in situations that are too dangerous for humans such as the 2011 fukushima nuclear plant disasterbecause chimp is supposed to work independently in disastrous conditions it needs both manual and mental nimbleness an important part of the design these days is you cant guarantee youre going to be in radio contact all the time so the thing has to be able to think for itself when its out of radio communication moore tells 60 minutesbut dont expect robots to replace humans too quickly a lot of these robots are in their infancy marks says and they mess up everyday tasks like picking up a cup of coffee can still confound a robotmoore concedes that roboticists and ai researchers still have a lot of work to do but hes optimistic that ai will someday help us live a safer more secure existencethe biggest problems of the world — terrorism mass migration climate change — when i look at these problems i dont feel helpless moore says i feel that this generation of young computer scientists is actually building technology to put the world rightthe video above was originally published on oct

theyearartificial intelligence reference materialsdebates about the social impact of creating intelligent machines has occupied many organizations and individuals over the past decades since many of the early science fiction speculations and predictions from the late 19th century through to the 1960s have already become reality there is no reason to assume that robots and intelligent machines will not happen we are already living in that eras future experiencing a golden age of technology with no end or limit in sightthe moral and ethical implications of artificial intelligences are obvious and there are three sides to the argument while one party argues that there are already too many of us living in poverty without work there is little or no reason to create mechanical laborers that can think independently and that we certainly should not create machines that can argue with us about such issuesanother party argues that society cannot develop or take advantage of resources without the help of machines that can think for themselves at least a little and party number three simply doesnt care about the issue at all as is typical of human societyon a more detailed level opinions also differ about the extent to which we should make machines intelligent and what these machines should look likeare we talking about autonomous devices like space explorers or robots that mimic human form thought and behavior as more and more of society gets automated will we entrust our children educational institutions businesses and governments to reasoning machines as wellthere are no clear answers here research is widespread and diverse covering all of the aspects of artificial intelligence we dont even agree on what exactly defines intelligence and already we are creating artificial ones so who is to say what is rightbut if we do build android machines with a designed intelligence that think and behave like humans shouldnt they be made absolutely subservient to usisaac asimov the science fiction author well known for his robot novels amongst the myriad others wrote the three laws of robotics early in the last century which were incorporated into the positronic brains of his robots in order to protect humans from a robot revolution and to prevent other humans abusing thembrainwashingthe above three principles are a good example of the difficulty in programming an artificial brain the human brain is evolved through millions of years of survival and social behavior we are still undergoing this processimitating the brains workings is a tremendous challenge and judging by the advance of current processor power and complexity will take at least several decades more to reach even the most rudimentary levelsand once we have decided that we do want android robots and other machines with an artificially created intelligence sophisticated enough to rival our own the question still remains with which ethical and moral values do we instill them looking at human civilization with its diverse cultural religious ethical and moral values what exactly are we trying to create here and to what purpose do we needs robots for example that are religiously biased is that what human society needs the perfect catholic muslim or buddhist mind or do we want a mind that is ruthlessly calculative for example the perfect capitalist or efficiency expert a law enforcer perhaps just defining those values would already prove impossible as they are all similar in many ways as well as being radically different so instead we design the perfect ascetic mind and then what that certainly wont please a lot people and what about practical applications of these values if one set of ethical or religious values dictates that we cannot assist in euthanasia for example and another dictates that it is imperative that we do arent we just duplicating current issues without any real answers what would be the point perhaps artificial intelligences will show the same diversity as humans so what would be the point then of creating artificial humans dont we have problems enough with the biological ones or are we simply looking to design a perfect

availabledefining artificial intelligence isn’t just difficult it’s impossible not the least because we don’t really understand human intelligence paradoxically advances in ai will help more to define what human intelligence isn’t than what artificial intelligence isbut whatever ai is we’ve clearly made a lot of progress in the past few years in areas ranging from computer vision to game playing ai is making the transition from a research topic to the early stages of enterprise adoption companies such as google and facebook have placed huge bets on ai and are already using it in their products but google and facebook are only the beginning over the next decade we’ll see ai steadily creep into one product after another we’ll be communicating with bots rather than scripted robodialers and not realizing that they aren’t human we’ll be relying on cars to plan routes and respond to road hazards it’s a good bet that in the next decades some features of ai will be incorporated into every application that we touch and that we won’t be able to do anything without touching an applicationgiven that our future will inevitably be tied up with ai it’s imperative that we ask where are we now what is the state of ai and where are we headingdescriptions of ai span several axes strength how intelligent is it breadth does it solve a narrowly defined problem or is it general training how does it learn capabilities what kinds of problems are we asking it to solve and autonomy are ais assistive technologies or do they act on their own each of these axes is a spectrum and each point in this manydimensional space represents a different way of understanding the goals and capabilities of an ai systemon the strength axis it’s very easy to look at the results of the last 20 years and realize that we’ve made some extremely powerful programs deep blue beat garry kasparov in chess watson beat the best jeopardy champions of all time alphago beat lee sedol arguably the world’s best go player but all of these successes are limited deep blue watson and alphago were all highly specialized singlepurpose machines that did one thing extremely well deep blue and watson can’t play go and alphago can’t play chess or jeopardy even on a basic level their intelligence is very narrow and can’t be generalized a lot of work has gone into using watson for applications such as medical diagnosis but it’s still fundamentally a questionandanswer machine that must be tuned for a specific domain deep blue has a lot of specialized knowledge about chess strategy and an encyclopedic knowledge of openings alphago was built with a more general architecture but a lot of handcrafted knowledge still made its way into the code i don’t mean to trivialize or undervalue their accomplishments but it’s important to realize what they haven’t donewe haven’t yet created an artificial general intelligence that can solve a multiplicity of different kinds of problems we still don’t have a machine that can listen to recordings of humans for a year or two and start speaking while alphago “learned” to play go by analyzing thousands of games and then playing thousands more against itself the same software couldn’t be used to master chess the same general approach probably but our best current efforts are far from a general intelligence that is flexible enough to learn without supervision or flexible enough to choose what it wants to learn whether that’s playing board games or designing pc boardshow do we get from narrow domainspecific intelligence to more general intelligence by “general intelligence” we don’t necessarily mean human intelligence but we do want machines that can solve different kinds of problems without being programmed with domainspecific knowledge we want machines that can make human judgments and decisions that doesn’t necessarily mean that ai systems will implement concepts like creativity intuition or instinct which may have no digital analogs a general intelligence would have the ability to follow multiple pursuits and to adapt to unexpected situations and a general ai would undoubtedly implement concepts like “justice” and “fairness” we’re already talking about the impact of ai on the legal systema selfdriving car demonstrates the problems we’re facing to be selfdriving a car needs to integrate pattern recognition with other capabilities including reasoning planning and memory it needs to recognize patterns so it can react to obstacles and street signs it needs to reason both to understand driving regulations and to solve problems like avoiding obstacles it needs to plan a route from its current location to its destination taking into account traffic and other patterns it needs to do all of these repeatedly updating its solutions constantly however even though a selfdriving car incorporates just about all of ai it doesn’t have the flexibility we’d expect from a general intelligence system you wouldn’t expect a selfdriving car to have a conversation or lay out your garden transfer learning or taking results from one area and applying them to another is very difficult you could probably reengineer many of the software components but that only points out what’s missing our current ais provide narrow solutions to specific problems they aren’t general problem solvers you can add narrow ais ad infinitum a car could have a bot that talks about where to go that makes restaurant recommendations that plays chess with you so you don’t get bored but a pile of narrow intelligences will never add up to a general intelligence general intelligence isnt about the number of abilities but about integration between those abilitieswhile approaches like neural networks were originally developed to mimic the human brain’s processes many ai initiatives have given up on the notion of imitating a biological brain we don’t know how brains work neural networks are computationally useful but they’re not imitating human thought in artificial intelligence a modern approach peter norvig and stuart russell write that “the quest for ‘artificial flight’ succeeded when the wright brothers and others stopped imitating birds and started … learning about aerodynamics” similarly to make progress ai need not focus on imitating the brain’s biological processes and instead try to understand the problems that the brain solves it’s a safe bet that humans use any number of techniques to learn regardless of what may be happening on the biological level the same will probably be true of a general artificial intelligence it will use pattern matching like alphago it will use rulebased systems like watson it will use exhaustive search trees like deep blue none of these techniques map directly onto human intelligence what humans appear to do better than any computer is to build models of their world and act on those modelsthe next step past general intelligence is superintelligence or hyperintelligence it’s not clear how to distinguish superintelligence from general intelligence would we expect a superintelligence system to possess qualities like creativity and initiative given that we have trouble understanding human creativity it’s hard to think of machine creativity as a useful concept go experts described some of alphago’s moves as “creative” however they came out of exactly the same processes and patterns as all the other moves not from looking at the game in a different way repeated application of the same algorithms can produce results that humans find surprising or unexpected but merely being surprising isn’t what we call “creativity”it’s easier to think of superintelligence as a matter of scale if we can create “general intelligence” it’s easy to assume that it could quickly become thousands of times more powerful than human intelligence or more precisely either general intelligence will be significantly slower than human thought and it will be difficult to speed it up either through hardware or software or it will speed up quickly through massive parallelism and hardware improvements we’ll go from thousandcore gpus to trillions of cores on thousands of chips with data streaming in from billions of sensors in the first case when speedups are slow general intelligence might not be all that interesting though it will have been a great ride for the researchers in the second case the rampup will be very steep and very fastalphago’s developers claimed to use a much more general approach to ai than deep blue they produced a system that had minimal knowledge of go strategy but instead learned by observing go games that points toward the next big direction can we get from supervised learning where a machine is trained on labeled data to unsupervised learning where a machine learns for itself how to group and structure datain a post on facebook yann lecun says “we need to solve the unsupervised learning problem before we can even think of getting to true ai” to classify photos an ai system is given millions of photos that have already been classified correctly after learning from these classifications it’s given another set of tagged photos to determine whether it can tag the test set correctly what can a machine do without tagging can it discover what’s important in a photo without metadata telling it “this is a bird this is a plane this is a flower” can a machine discover structure by observation with much less data something that both humans and animals can doboth humans and animals can form models and abstractions from relatively little data it doesn’t take millions of images for us to recognize a new kind of bird for example or to find our way around a new city predicting future frames of a video a problem researchers are now working on would require an ai system to build an understanding of how the world works is it possible to develop a system that can respond to completely new situations such as a car sliding unpredictably on ice is it possible to build a car that can drive without the benefit of a map humans can solve these problems though they’re not necessarily good at it unsupervised learning points to problems that can’t just be solved by better faster hardware or by developers working with the current librariesthere are approaches to learning that represent a point between supervised and unsupervised learning in reinforcement learning the system is given some value that represents a reward can a robot run across a field without falling can a car drive across town without a map rewards can be fed back into the system and used to maximize the probability of success openai gym is a promising framework for reinforcement learningat one extreme supervised learning means reproducing a set of tags which is essentially pattern recognition and prone to overfitting at the other extreme completely unsupervised learning means learning to reason inductively about a situation and requires algorithmic breakthroughs semisupervised learning with minimal tags or reinforcement learning by sequential decision making represent approaches between these extremes we’ll see how far they can take uswhat we mean by “intelligence” is a fundamental question in a radar post from 2014 beau cronin did an excellent job of summarizing the many definitions of ai what we expect from artificial intelligence depends critically on what we want the ai to do discussions of ai almost always start with the turing test turing assumed that people would interact with a computer through a chatlike model he assumed a conversation with the computer this assumption places limitations on what we expect the computer to do we don’t expect it to drive cars or assemble circuits for example it’s also an intentionally ambiguous test the computer’s answers might be evasive or just plain incorrect being unerringly correct isn’t the point human intelligences are also evasive and incorrect wed be unlikely to mistake an ai that was unerringly correct for a humanif we assume that ai must be embodied in hardware that’s capable of motion such as a robot or an autonomous vehicle we get a different set of criteria we’re asking the computer to perform a poorly defined task like driving to the store under its own control we can already build ai systems that can do a better job of planning a route and driving than most humans the one accident in which one of google’s autonomous vehicles was at fault occurred because the algorithms were modified to drive more like a human and to take risks that the ai system would not normally have takenthere are plenty of difficult driving problems that selfdriving cars haven’t solved driving on a mountain road in a blizzard for example whether the ai system is embodied in a car a drone aircraft or a humanoid robot the problems it will face will be essentially similar how to perform in safe comfortable circumstances will be easy how to perform in highrisk dangerous situations will be much harder humans aren’t good at those tasks either but while turing would expect an ai in conversation to be evasive or even answer questions incorrectly vague or incorrect solutions while driving down a highway aren’t acceptableais that can take physical action force us to think about robotic behavior what sort of ethics govern autonomous robots asimov’s laws of robotics if we think a robot should never kill or injure a human weaponized drones have already thrown that out the window while the stereotypical question “if an accident is unavoidable should an autonomous car crash into the baby or the grandmother” is fake ethics there are versions of the question that are more serious should a selfdriving car plunge into a crowd to avoid an accident that might kill its passenger it’s easy to answer the question in the abstract but it’s hard to imagine humans buying a vehicle that will sacrifice them rather than injure bystanders i doubt the robots will be expected to answer this question but it will certainly be discussed in the board rooms of ford gm toyota and teslawe can define ai more simply by dispensing with the intricacies of conversational systems or autonomous robotic systems and saying that ai is solely about building systems that answer questions and solve problems systems that can answer questions and reason about complex logic are the “expert systems” that we’ve been building for some years now most recently embodied in watson alphago solves a different kind of problem however as beau cronin points out solving problems that humans find intellectually challenging is relatively easy what’s much more difficult is solving the problems that humans find easy few three year olds can play go all three year olds can recognize their parents—and without a substantial set of tagged imageswhat we mean by “intelligence” depends strongly on what we want that intelligence to do there is no single definition that’s adequate for all of our goals without welldefined goals that tell us what we’re trying to achieve and let us measure whether we’ve achieved it the transition from narrow ai to general ai is not going to be easypress coverage of ai focuses on autonomous systems machines that act on their own with good reason that’s the fun sexy and somewhat scary face of ai it’s easy to watch alphago with a human servant to make its moves and fantasize about a future dominated by machines but there’s something more to ai than autonomous devices that make humans obsolete where is the real value artificial intelligence or intelligence augmentation ai or ia that question has been asked since the first attempts at ai and is explored in depth by john markoff in machines of loving grace we may not want an ai system to make decisions we may want to reserve decision making for ourselves we may want ai that augments our intelligence by providing us with information predicting the consequences of any course of action and making recommendations but leaving decisions to the humans the matrix notwithstanding a future in which artificial intelligence is at our service augmenting our intelligence rather than overruling it is much more likely than a future in which we’re the servants of an overreaching aia gps navigation system is an excellent example of an ai system that augments human intelligence given a good map most humans can navigate from point a to point b though our abilities leave a lot to be desired particularly if we’re in unfamiliar territory plotting the best route between two locations is a difficult problem particularly when you account for problems like bad traffic and road conditions but with the exception of autonomous vehicles we’ve never connected the navigation engine to the steering wheel a gps is strictly an assistive technology it gives recommendations not commands whenever you hear the gps saying “recalculating route” a human has made a decision or a mistake that ignored the gps recommendation and the gps is adaptingover the past few years we’ve seen many applications that qualify as ai in one sense or another almost anything that falls under the rubric of “machine learning” qualifies as artificial intelligence indeed “machine learning” was the name given to the more successful parts of ai back when the discipline fell into disrepute you don’t have to build something with a human voice like amazon’s alexa to be ai amazon’s recommendation engine is certainly ai so is a web application like stitchfix which augments choices made by fashion experts with choices made by a recommendation engine we’ve become accustomed to and are frequently annoyed by chat bots that handle customer service calls more or less accurately you’ll probably end up talking to a human but the secret is using the chat bot to get all the routine questions out of the way there’s no point in requiring a human to transcribe your address your policy number and other standard information a computer can do it at least as accurately if not morethe next generation of assistants will be and already is semiautonomous several years ago larry page said the star trek computer was the ideal search engine it was a computer that understood humans had already digested all the information available and could answer questions before they were even asked if you have used google now you were probably surprised the first time it told you to leave early for an appointment because the traffic was bad that requires looking across several different data sets your current location the location of your appointment probably in your calendar or in your contacts list google’s mapping data current traffic conditions and even chronological data about expected traffic patterns the goal isn’t answering a question it’s providing assistance before users even know they need itwhy is ai currently such a hot topic after having being in disrepute for a few decades of “ai winter” of course ai was in the news briefly after deep blue and again after watson but these fads didn’t last it’s tempting to see the current rise of ai as another fad that would ignore the changes of the past decadethe rise of ai has depended on tremendous advances in computer hardware it’s tedious to recite the huge advances in performance and storage technology in the 30 years since the start of the ai winter which wikipedia traces to 1984 but that’s an unavoidable part of the story particularly if you’ve seen the racks of machines that made up ibm’s watson alphago reportedly ran on 1920 cpus and 280 gpus the machine that beat lee sedol may have been even larger and used custom hardware google has developed for building neural networks even if ai algorithms are too slow to be productive on a typical laptop it’s easy and relatively inexpensive to allocate some serious computing horsepower on cloud platforms like aws gce and azure and machine learning was enabled in part by the ability to store vast amounts of data in 1985 gigabytes were rare and weighed hundreds of pounds now gigabytes are commonplace inexpensive and tinyin addition to the ability to store and process data we now have the ability to generate data in the 80s most photography was analog now it’s all digital and a lot of it is stored online in services like flickr google photos apple photos facebook and more many online photos are already tagged with some descriptive text making them a great dataset for training ai systems many of our conversations are also online through facebook twitter and many chat services as are our shopping histories so we or more precisely google apple yahoo facebook amazon and others have the data needed to train ai systemswe’ve also made significant advances in algorithms neural networks aren’t particularly new but “deep learning” stacks up a series of networks with feedback so the network automatically trains itself deep learning thus tries to solve one of the hardest human problems in machine learning learning optimal representations and features from data processing a lot of data is easy but feature learning is more of an art than a science deep learning automates some of that artnot only have we made progress in algorithms the algorithms are implemented in widely available libraries such as caffe tensorflow theano scikitlearn mxnet cntk and others ai isn’t limited to cs researchers in academic settings increasingly anyone can take part as pete warden has shown you don’t need to know how to implement a complex algorithm and make it run reasonably well on your hardware you just need to know how to install a library and tag training data just as the pc revolution itself took place when computers moved out of machine rooms and became accessible to the general public the same process of democratization is producing a revolution in ai as people from many backgrounds and environments experiment with ai we’ll see new kinds of applications some will seem like science fiction though selfdriving cars seemed like science fiction only a few years ago there will certainly be new applications that we can’t even imaginethe world is full of “dark data” unstructured information that doesn’t live in nice orderly databases it’s on websites buried in tables enshrined in photographs and movies but it’s not easily accessible to machine intelligence or to any other intelligence projects like diffbot and deepdive use semisupervised learning to find the structure in unstructured data—whether masses of scientific papers or the scrapings of many websites once they’ve created a database that database can be accessed by moreconventional tools whether apis sql statements or desktop applicationsknowledge databases and graphs are already in use in many intelligent applications including google’s knowledge graph as we move toward conversational applications the ability to unearth dark data and find structure in it will become even more critical using dark data effectively will be the key to moving from scripted and narrowly purposed chat applications to applications that can take an arbitrary question and return an answer to the user we might not see such an application as “understanding” the question but applications like this will be at the heart of future assistive technologies and they will rely on knowledge databases that have been scraped and structured by machine the sheer volume of data involved will be beyond humans’ tagging abilitiesunlike the dark times of the ai winter when data was limited and computers were slow we’re seeing successful ai systems everywhere google translate is nowhere near as good as a human translator but it frequently gives you a usable translation while it hasn’t been on the radar anywhere near as much speech recognition systems are also commonplace and surprisingly accurate a year ago google claimed that an android phone could correctly understand 92 of the questions it was asked given that a computer can correctly turn a question into text the next step is to turn that question into an answersimilarly image recognition and image processing have become commonplace despite some highly publicized and embarrassing mistakes computer vision systems can identify faces with an accuracy that was unthinkable a few years ago granted constraining the problem properly plays a huge role in this success facebook can identify faces in your photos because it’s assuming that the people in your photos are likely to be your friends computer vision is or will be central to many applications of ai from the mundane to the scary vision is obviously critical to autonomous vehicles it’s also critical to surveillance autotargeting drones and other uncomfortable applicationsdeep learning and neural networks have attracted a lot of attention in the past year they have enabled progress in computer vision natural language and other fields however almost anything that falls under the rubric of machine learning is artificial intelligence classification and clustering algorithms various kinds of decision trees genetic algorithms support vector machines hierarchical temporal memory and many others these techniques can be used by themselves or in combination with others ibm’s watson is a good example of ensemble learning it is a rulebased system that incorporates many other algorithms depending on the problem it is solving the rules are largely handcrafted and the other algorithms need to be painstakingly tuned to get good resultsimpressive as watson is systems that require huge amounts of hand tuning are at best a stepping stone toward intelligence any general ai and most narrow ais will probably combine many algorithms rather than using a single yettobediscovered master algorithm but the tuning required to get good results is a major limitation demis hassabis leader of the alphago team says that tuning is “almost like an art form” is it really “artificial intelligence” if getting good results requires years of work and only a few specialists hassabis says a few hundred are capable of doing that work the creation of an engine like watson is science but it also requires a lot of art in addition the need for manual optimization suggests that ais built this way are inherently narrow designed to solve a single problem it’s very difficult to imagine optimizing a “general intelligence” engine that can work on any problem if you’re optimizing you’re almost certainly optimizing for something for some specific applicationdo advances in ai depend on better algorithms or better hardware the answer to that question is “both” if the question is even meaningful even though clock speeds have stalled our ability to put more and more on a chip hasn’t stalled alphago’s 280 gpus could easily mean 200000 cores more important though we’ve seen a lot of improvement in mathematical libraries and tools for using gpus we may also see the use of asics and fpgas applicationspecific integrated circuit and fieldprogrammable gate arrays in future ai engines in turn asics and fpgas will be critical to embedding ai in hardware systems many of which think autonomous vehicles will need to run in hard realtimebut even if the hardware is better we will still need algorithms that can be distributed across thousands or millions of nodes we will need algorithms that can reprogram fpgas on the fly to adapt the hardware to the problems they are solving mapreduce became popular for data analysis because it suggested a way to parallelize a large class of problems parallelism obviously works for ai but what are its limits the hard fact of parallelism is that the part of the program that can’t be parallelized kills you and the hallmark of most parallel algorithms is that you need a phase that collects partial results and generates a single result alphago may look at thousands of alternatives when computing its next move but at some point it needs to look at all the alternatives evaluate which is best and present a single result alphago can take advantage of 280 gpus what about a machine with 280000 after all the largest ai systems we’ve built so far are a small fraction of the size of a rat brain let alone a human brain what about algorithms that don’t lend themselves to parallelism as well as neural networks how do you apply feedback in systems where each element of the pipeline is taking a different approach to the problem questions like these are likely to drive ai research in the near futurethrowing more and faster hardware at ai algorithms is likely to get us better go chess and jeopardy players we’ll be able to classify images better and faster but that’s an improvement in the problems we can currently solve will more computing power get us from supervised to unsupervised learning will it lead us from narrow intelligence to general intelligence that remains to be seen unsupervised learning is a hard problem and it’s not clear that it can be solved just by throwing more hardware at it we’re still looking for a “master algorithm” that may not existit is easy to get scared by talk of superhuman intelligence and according to some it is time to decide what we want our machines to do before it’s too late while this position may be oversimplified it is very difficult to think about limiting devices that we can’t build and whose capabilities we can’t imagine now and may never understand in the future it is also difficult to say “no” because i’m not aware of any technology that hasn’t been invented because people thought better of it beforehand at different times in history people were afraid of many technologies that are now commonplace at one point many thought that traveling over 60 miles per hour would be fatal socrates was opposed to writing because he thought it would lead to forgetfulness imagine what he would have thought of our technologybut we can think about the future of ai and how we will develop machines that assist us here are a few suggestionsmost fears of a superintelligent ai aren’t really fears of a machine we neither know or understand they are fears about human nature at its worst coupled with unlimited power we don’t imagine a machine that thinks thoughts we can’t comprehend we imagine an unbeatable hitler or stalin whose thoughts we do comprehend our fears are essentially human fears fears of omnipotent machines acting like humansthat isn’t to denigrate our fears because we’ve seen that machine learning does learn from us microsoft’s unfortunate tay was a tooperfect example of a conversational ai bot that “learned” racism and bigotry from the people it talked to online google’s image classification that identified a black couple as “gorillas” was the result of poor testing and a training set that didn’t have enough properly tagged pictures of black people machines learn to be racist much the same way that humans do because we teach them to be that way whether intentionally or accidentally that’s a human problem and it’s one that’s solvable we can be more careful about what and how our artificial intelligences learn we can be more careful about what’s in our training sets how those sets are tagged and we can filter what kinds of answers we consider acceptable none of this is terribly difficult it just has to be done what’s more difficult in the current climate is reaching a consensus that racism and hatred are not okthat’s a problem of human values not machine intelligence we can build machines that reflect our values we do that already are they the values that we want to reflect the white house’s report on data science big risks big opportunities the intersection of big data and civil rights concludes with a section on the need for research on how to audit algorithms to “ensure that people are being treated fairly” as we move from “big data” to ai the need to audit our algorithms and make sure they reflect values we support will only increaseit is extremely important that research into artificial intelligence be open and visible to the public not because we believe the public will be less “afraid” of research that happens in the open that may or may not be true or because the public will somehow become “used to” the idea of superintelligence but because there is greater concern about research that goes on behind closed doors versus research that goes on in public indeed unethical research suggests that the best way to create a healthy ai ecosystem is to publish ideas for creating malevolent machines research will continue to go on behind closed doors it would be naive to think that military research and intelligence services aren’t working on artificial intelligence but we will be at the mercy of that research if there isn’t also ai research happening in the public sphere whether an organization such as google or facebook constitutes “behind closed doors” or “in public view” is a debate worth having that’s the point of openai “to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole unconstrained by a need to generate financial return” openai is a dramatic and surprising answer to the fear of ai push ai research forward as far as possible but in public make sure that the public sphere remains ahead of closeddoor aiit is also important for research to be open and in the public sphere because research’s origins often determine its application nuclear energy is a good example it’s possible to build safe efficient nuclear reactors that are fueled by thorium but thorium reactors were never built because they don’t help you build bombs and research into nuclear power was under the control of the defense department a reactor that doesn’t generate plutonium in usable quantities why would anyone want that again it’s naive to think that military and national intelligence services won’t do excellent ai research but if ai research becomes the sole province of the military we will have excellent autotargeting drones if ai research becomes the sole province of national intelligence we will have excellent systems for surreptitiously listening to and understanding conversations our imaginations will be limited about what else ai might do for us and we will have trouble imagining ai applications other than murderous drones and the watchful ear of big brother we may never develop intelligent medical systems or robotic nurses’ aidesif we want ai to serve humanity it must be developed in public as part of the larger community of ai researchers and as part of a wider public discourse about our goals and aims we must be careful not to build our own worst nightmare but we need to realize that the nightmare is really just a more powerful version of ourselvesmark zuckerberg recently said that ai will be better than humans at most basic tasks in 5 to 10 years he may be correct but it’s also clear that he’s talking about narrow intelligence specific tasks like speech recognition image classification and of course game playing he continues to say “that doesnt mean that the computers will be thinking” depending on who you talk to a real general intelligence is 10 to 50 years out given the difficulty of predicting the future of technology the best answer is “more than 10 years” and possibly much more when will humanlevel machine intelligence hlmi be achieved a recent survey of experts suggests that hlmi will occur with 50 probability sometime between 20402050 as yann lecun says “humanlevel general ai is several decades away”so when will we get there if ever a few years ago jason huggins hugs made a prescient remark about robots robots he said are always in the future from time to time bits of robotics break off and become part of the present but when that happens they’re no longer considered robotics in the 1920s we would have considered a modern dishwasher a superintelligent robot now it’s just a dishwasherthe same will inevitably happen for artificial intelligence indeed it is already happening i have avoided making a distinction between machine learning and ai “machine learning” is a term that was applied to ideas from ai research back when ai was disreputable now many of those ideas are commonplace we don’t think twice about amazon recommendations or gps navigation systems we take those for granted we may find facebook and google’s ability to tag photos creepy but we don’t think ai when we see it all serious chess players practice against chess programs so do beginning go players and after alphago’s success practicing against a computer will certainly extend to experts these are artificial intelligences that have already broken off and become parts of our world in doing so ai morphed into ia intelligence augmentation autonomous technology that trumped human abilities became assistivewill we ever be able to point to something and say “yes that’s artificial intelligence” yes certainly we can do that now what’s more important is that we will inevitably be surrounded by ai

availabledefining artificial intelligence isn’t just difficult it’s impossible not the least because we don’t really understand human intelligence paradoxically advances in ai will help more to define what human intelligence isn’t than what artificial intelligence isbut whatever ai is we’ve clearly made a lot of progress in the past few years in areas ranging from computer vision to game playing ai is making the transition from a research topic to the early stages of enterprise adoption companies such as google and facebook have placed huge bets on ai and are already using it in their products but google and facebook are only the beginning over the next decade we’ll see ai steadily creep into one product after another we’ll be communicating with bots rather than scripted robodialers and not realizing that they aren’t human we’ll be relying on cars to plan routes and respond to road hazards it’s a good bet that in the next decades some features of ai will be incorporated into every application that we touch and that we won’t be able to do anything without touching an applicationgiven that our future will inevitably be tied up with ai it’s imperative that we ask where are we now what is the state of ai and where are we headingdescriptions of ai span several axes strength how intelligent is it breadth does it solve a narrowly defined problem or is it general training how does it learn capabilities what kinds of problems are we asking it to solve and autonomy are ais assistive technologies or do they act on their own each of these axes is a spectrum and each point in this manydimensional space represents a different way of understanding the goals and capabilities of an ai systemon the strength axis it’s very easy to look at the results of the last 20 years and realize that we’ve made some extremely powerful programs deep blue beat garry kasparov in chess watson beat the best jeopardy champions of all time alphago beat lee sedol arguably the world’s best go player but all of these successes are limited deep blue watson and alphago were all highly specialized singlepurpose machines that did one thing extremely well deep blue and watson can’t play go and alphago can’t play chess or jeopardy even on a basic level their intelligence is very narrow and can’t be generalized a lot of work has gone into using watson for applications such as medical diagnosis but it’s still fundamentally a questionandanswer machine that must be tuned for a specific domain deep blue has a lot of specialized knowledge about chess strategy and an encyclopedic knowledge of openings alphago was built with a more general architecture but a lot of handcrafted knowledge still made its way into the code i don’t mean to trivialize or undervalue their accomplishments but it’s important to realize what they haven’t donewe haven’t yet created an artificial general intelligence that can solve a multiplicity of different kinds of problems we still don’t have a machine that can listen to recordings of humans for a year or two and start speaking while alphago “learned” to play go by analyzing thousands of games and then playing thousands more against itself the same software couldn’t be used to master chess the same general approach probably but our best current efforts are far from a general intelligence that is flexible enough to learn without supervision or flexible enough to choose what it wants to learn whether that’s playing board games or designing pc boardshow do we get from narrow domainspecific intelligence to more general intelligence by “general intelligence” we don’t necessarily mean human intelligence but we do want machines that can solve different kinds of problems without being programmed with domainspecific knowledge we want machines that can make human judgments and decisions that doesn’t necessarily mean that ai systems will implement concepts like creativity intuition or instinct which may have no digital analogs a general intelligence would have the ability to follow multiple pursuits and to adapt to unexpected situations and a general ai would undoubtedly implement concepts like “justice” and “fairness” we’re already talking about the impact of ai on the legal systema selfdriving car demonstrates the problems we’re facing to be selfdriving a car needs to integrate pattern recognition with other capabilities including reasoning planning and memory it needs to recognize patterns so it can react to obstacles and street signs it needs to reason both to understand driving regulations and to solve problems like avoiding obstacles it needs to plan a route from its current location to its destination taking into account traffic and other patterns it needs to do all of these repeatedly updating its solutions constantly however even though a selfdriving car incorporates just about all of ai it doesn’t have the flexibility we’d expect from a general intelligence system you wouldn’t expect a selfdriving car to have a conversation or lay out your garden transfer learning or taking results from one area and applying them to another is very difficult you could probably reengineer many of the software components but that only points out what’s missing our current ais provide narrow solutions to specific problems they aren’t general problem solvers you can add narrow ais ad infinitum a car could have a bot that talks about where to go that makes restaurant recommendations that plays chess with you so you don’t get bored but a pile of narrow intelligences will never add up to a general intelligence general intelligence isnt about the number of abilities but about integration between those abilitieswhile approaches like neural networks were originally developed to mimic the human brain’s processes many ai initiatives have given up on the notion of imitating a biological brain we don’t know how brains work neural networks are computationally useful but they’re not imitating human thought in artificial intelligence a modern approach peter norvig and stuart russell write that “the quest for ‘artificial flight’ succeeded when the wright brothers and others stopped imitating birds and started … learning about aerodynamics” similarly to make progress ai need not focus on imitating the brain’s biological processes and instead try to understand the problems that the brain solves it’s a safe bet that humans use any number of techniques to learn regardless of what may be happening on the biological level the same will probably be true of a general artificial intelligence it will use pattern matching like alphago it will use rulebased systems like watson it will use exhaustive search trees like deep blue none of these techniques map directly onto human intelligence what humans appear to do better than any computer is to build models of their world and act on those modelsthe next step past general intelligence is superintelligence or hyperintelligence it’s not clear how to distinguish superintelligence from general intelligence would we expect a superintelligence system to possess qualities like creativity and initiative given that we have trouble understanding human creativity it’s hard to think of machine creativity as a useful concept go experts described some of alphago’s moves as “creative” however they came out of exactly the same processes and patterns as all the other moves not from looking at the game in a different way repeated application of the same algorithms can produce results that humans find surprising or unexpected but merely being surprising isn’t what we call “creativity”it’s easier to think of superintelligence as a matter of scale if we can create “general intelligence” it’s easy to assume that it could quickly become thousands of times more powerful than human intelligence or more precisely either general intelligence will be significantly slower than human thought and it will be difficult to speed it up either through hardware or software or it will speed up quickly through massive parallelism and hardware improvements we’ll go from thousandcore gpus to trillions of cores on thousands of chips with data streaming in from billions of sensors in the first case when speedups are slow general intelligence might not be all that interesting though it will have been a great ride for the researchers in the second case the rampup will be very steep and very fastalphago’s developers claimed to use a much more general approach to ai than deep blue they produced a system that had minimal knowledge of go strategy but instead learned by observing go games that points toward the next big direction can we get from supervised learning where a machine is trained on labeled data to unsupervised learning where a machine learns for itself how to group and structure datain a post on facebook yann lecun says “we need to solve the unsupervised learning problem before we can even think of getting to true ai” to classify photos an ai system is given millions of photos that have already been classified correctly after learning from these classifications it’s given another set of tagged photos to determine whether it can tag the test set correctly what can a machine do without tagging can it discover what’s important in a photo without metadata telling it “this is a bird this is a plane this is a flower” can a machine discover structure by observation with much less data something that both humans and animals can doboth humans and animals can form models and abstractions from relatively little data it doesn’t take millions of images for us to recognize a new kind of bird for example or to find our way around a new city predicting future frames of a video a problem researchers are now working on would require an ai system to build an understanding of how the world works is it possible to develop a system that can respond to completely new situations such as a car sliding unpredictably on ice is it possible to build a car that can drive without the benefit of a map humans can solve these problems though they’re not necessarily good at it unsupervised learning points to problems that can’t just be solved by better faster hardware or by developers working with the current librariesthere are approaches to learning that represent a point between supervised and unsupervised learning in reinforcement learning the system is given some value that represents a reward can a robot run across a field without falling can a car drive across town without a map rewards can be fed back into the system and used to maximize the probability of success openai gym is a promising framework for reinforcement learningat one extreme supervised learning means reproducing a set of tags which is essentially pattern recognition and prone to overfitting at the other extreme completely unsupervised learning means learning to reason inductively about a situation and requires algorithmic breakthroughs semisupervised learning with minimal tags or reinforcement learning by sequential decision making represent approaches between these extremes we’ll see how far they can take uswhat we mean by “intelligence” is a fundamental question in a radar post from 2014 beau cronin did an excellent job of summarizing the many definitions of ai what we expect from artificial intelligence depends critically on what we want the ai to do discussions of ai almost always start with the turing test turing assumed that people would interact with a computer through a chatlike model he assumed a conversation with the computer this assumption places limitations on what we expect the computer to do we don’t expect it to drive cars or assemble circuits for example it’s also an intentionally ambiguous test the computer’s answers might be evasive or just plain incorrect being unerringly correct isn’t the point human intelligences are also evasive and incorrect wed be unlikely to mistake an ai that was unerringly correct for a humanif we assume that ai must be embodied in hardware that’s capable of motion such as a robot or an autonomous vehicle we get a different set of criteria we’re asking the computer to perform a poorly defined task like driving to the store under its own control we can already build ai systems that can do a better job of planning a route and driving than most humans the one accident in which one of google’s autonomous vehicles was at fault occurred because the algorithms were modified to drive more like a human and to take risks that the ai system would not normally have takenthere are plenty of difficult driving problems that selfdriving cars haven’t solved driving on a mountain road in a blizzard for example whether the ai system is embodied in a car a drone aircraft or a humanoid robot the problems it will face will be essentially similar how to perform in safe comfortable circumstances will be easy how to perform in highrisk dangerous situations will be much harder humans aren’t good at those tasks either but while turing would expect an ai in conversation to be evasive or even answer questions incorrectly vague or incorrect solutions while driving down a highway aren’t acceptableais that can take physical action force us to think about robotic behavior what sort of ethics govern autonomous robots asimov’s laws of robotics if we think a robot should never kill or injure a human weaponized drones have already thrown that out the window while the stereotypical question “if an accident is unavoidable should an autonomous car crash into the baby or the grandmother” is fake ethics there are versions of the question that are more serious should a selfdriving car plunge into a crowd to avoid an accident that might kill its passenger it’s easy to answer the question in the abstract but it’s hard to imagine humans buying a vehicle that will sacrifice them rather than injure bystanders i doubt the robots will be expected to answer this question but it will certainly be discussed in the board rooms of ford gm toyota and teslawe can define ai more simply by dispensing with the intricacies of conversational systems or autonomous robotic systems and saying that ai is solely about building systems that answer questions and solve problems systems that can answer questions and reason about complex logic are the “expert systems” that we’ve been building for some years now most recently embodied in watson alphago solves a different kind of problem however as beau cronin points out solving problems that humans find intellectually challenging is relatively easy what’s much more difficult is solving the problems that humans find easy few three year olds can play go all three year olds can recognize their parents—and without a substantial set of tagged imageswhat we mean by “intelligence” depends strongly on what we want that intelligence to do there is no single definition that’s adequate for all of our goals without welldefined goals that tell us what we’re trying to achieve and let us measure whether we’ve achieved it the transition from narrow ai to general ai is not going to be easypress coverage of ai focuses on autonomous systems machines that act on their own with good reason that’s the fun sexy and somewhat scary face of ai it’s easy to watch alphago with a human servant to make its moves and fantasize about a future dominated by machines but there’s something more to ai than autonomous devices that make humans obsolete where is the real value artificial intelligence or intelligence augmentation ai or ia that question has been asked since the first attempts at ai and is explored in depth by john markoff in machines of loving grace we may not want an ai system to make decisions we may want to reserve decision making for ourselves we may want ai that augments our intelligence by providing us with information predicting the consequences of any course of action and making recommendations but leaving decisions to the humans the matrix notwithstanding a future in which artificial intelligence is at our service augmenting our intelligence rather than overruling it is much more likely than a future in which we’re the servants of an overreaching aia gps navigation system is an excellent example of an ai system that augments human intelligence given a good map most humans can navigate from point a to point b though our abilities leave a lot to be desired particularly if we’re in unfamiliar territory plotting the best route between two locations is a difficult problem particularly when you account for problems like bad traffic and road conditions but with the exception of autonomous vehicles we’ve never connected the navigation engine to the steering wheel a gps is strictly an assistive technology it gives recommendations not commands whenever you hear the gps saying “recalculating route” a human has made a decision or a mistake that ignored the gps recommendation and the gps is adaptingover the past few years we’ve seen many applications that qualify as ai in one sense or another almost anything that falls under the rubric of “machine learning” qualifies as artificial intelligence indeed “machine learning” was the name given to the more successful parts of ai back when the discipline fell into disrepute you don’t have to build something with a human voice like amazon’s alexa to be ai amazon’s recommendation engine is certainly ai so is a web application like stitchfix which augments choices made by fashion experts with choices made by a recommendation engine we’ve become accustomed to and are frequently annoyed by chat bots that handle customer service calls more or less accurately you’ll probably end up talking to a human but the secret is using the chat bot to get all the routine questions out of the way there’s no point in requiring a human to transcribe your address your policy number and other standard information a computer can do it at least as accurately if not morethe next generation of assistants will be and already is semiautonomous several years ago larry page said the star trek computer was the ideal search engine it was a computer that understood humans had already digested all the information available and could answer questions before they were even asked if you have used google now you were probably surprised the first time it told you to leave early for an appointment because the traffic was bad that requires looking across several different data sets your current location the location of your appointment probably in your calendar or in your contacts list google’s mapping data current traffic conditions and even chronological data about expected traffic patterns the goal isn’t answering a question it’s providing assistance before users even know they need itwhy is ai currently such a hot topic after having being in disrepute for a few decades of “ai winter” of course ai was in the news briefly after deep blue and again after watson but these fads didn’t last it’s tempting to see the current rise of ai as another fad that would ignore the changes of the past decadethe rise of ai has depended on tremendous advances in computer hardware it’s tedious to recite the huge advances in performance and storage technology in the 30 years since the start of the ai winter which wikipedia traces to 1984 but that’s an unavoidable part of the story particularly if you’ve seen the racks of machines that made up ibm’s watson alphago reportedly ran on 1920 cpus and 280 gpus the machine that beat lee sedol may have been even larger and used custom hardware google has developed for building neural networks even if ai algorithms are too slow to be productive on a typical laptop it’s easy and relatively inexpensive to allocate some serious computing horsepower on cloud platforms like aws gce and azure and machine learning was enabled in part by the ability to store vast amounts of data in 1985 gigabytes were rare and weighed hundreds of pounds now gigabytes are commonplace inexpensive and tinyin addition to the ability to store and process data we now have the ability to generate data in the 80s most photography was analog now it’s all digital and a lot of it is stored online in services like flickr google photos apple photos facebook and more many online photos are already tagged with some descriptive text making them a great dataset for training ai systems many of our conversations are also online through facebook twitter and many chat services as are our shopping histories so we or more precisely google apple yahoo facebook amazon and others have the data needed to train ai systemswe’ve also made significant advances in algorithms neural networks aren’t particularly new but “deep learning” stacks up a series of networks with feedback so the network automatically trains itself deep learning thus tries to solve one of the hardest human problems in machine learning learning optimal representations and features from data processing a lot of data is easy but feature learning is more of an art than a science deep learning automates some of that artnot only have we made progress in algorithms the algorithms are implemented in widely available libraries such as caffe tensorflow theano scikitlearn mxnet cntk and others ai isn’t limited to cs researchers in academic settings increasingly anyone can take part as pete warden has shown you don’t need to know how to implement a complex algorithm and make it run reasonably well on your hardware you just need to know how to install a library and tag training data just as the pc revolution itself took place when computers moved out of machine rooms and became accessible to the general public the same process of democratization is producing a revolution in ai as people from many backgrounds and environments experiment with ai we’ll see new kinds of applications some will seem like science fiction though selfdriving cars seemed like science fiction only a few years ago there will certainly be new applications that we can’t even imaginethe world is full of “dark data” unstructured information that doesn’t live in nice orderly databases it’s on websites buried in tables enshrined in photographs and movies but it’s not easily accessible to machine intelligence or to any other intelligence projects like diffbot and deepdive use semisupervised learning to find the structure in unstructured data—whether masses of scientific papers or the scrapings of many websites once they’ve created a database that database can be accessed by moreconventional tools whether apis sql statements or desktop applicationsknowledge databases and graphs are already in use in many intelligent applications including google’s knowledge graph as we move toward conversational applications the ability to unearth dark data and find structure in it will become even more critical using dark data effectively will be the key to moving from scripted and narrowly purposed chat applications to applications that can take an arbitrary question and return an answer to the user we might not see such an application as “understanding” the question but applications like this will be at the heart of future assistive technologies and they will rely on knowledge databases that have been scraped and structured by machine the sheer volume of data involved will be beyond humans’ tagging abilitiesunlike the dark times of the ai winter when data was limited and computers were slow we’re seeing successful ai systems everywhere google translate is nowhere near as good as a human translator but it frequently gives you a usable translation while it hasn’t been on the radar anywhere near as much speech recognition systems are also commonplace and surprisingly accurate a year ago google claimed that an android phone could correctly understand 92 of the questions it was asked given that a computer can correctly turn a question into text the next step is to turn that question into an answersimilarly image recognition and image processing have become commonplace despite some highly publicized and embarrassing mistakes computer vision systems can identify faces with an accuracy that was unthinkable a few years ago granted constraining the problem properly plays a huge role in this success facebook can identify faces in your photos because it’s assuming that the people in your photos are likely to be your friends computer vision is or will be central to many applications of ai from the mundane to the scary vision is obviously critical to autonomous vehicles it’s also critical to surveillance autotargeting drones and other uncomfortable applicationsdeep learning and neural networks have attracted a lot of attention in the past year they have enabled progress in computer vision natural language and other fields however almost anything that falls under the rubric of machine learning is artificial intelligence classification and clustering algorithms various kinds of decision trees genetic algorithms support vector machines hierarchical temporal memory and many others these techniques can be used by themselves or in combination with others ibm’s watson is a good example of ensemble learning it is a rulebased system that incorporates many other algorithms depending on the problem it is solving the rules are largely handcrafted and the other algorithms need to be painstakingly tuned to get good resultsimpressive as watson is systems that require huge amounts of hand tuning are at best a stepping stone toward intelligence any general ai and most narrow ais will probably combine many algorithms rather than using a single yettobediscovered master algorithm but the tuning required to get good results is a major limitation demis hassabis leader of the alphago team says that tuning is “almost like an art form” is it really “artificial intelligence” if getting good results requires years of work and only a few specialists hassabis says a few hundred are capable of doing that work the creation of an engine like watson is science but it also requires a lot of art in addition the need for manual optimization suggests that ais built this way are inherently narrow designed to solve a single problem it’s very difficult to imagine optimizing a “general intelligence” engine that can work on any problem if you’re optimizing you’re almost certainly optimizing for something for some specific applicationdo advances in ai depend on better algorithms or better hardware the answer to that question is “both” if the question is even meaningful even though clock speeds have stalled our ability to put more and more on a chip hasn’t stalled alphago’s 280 gpus could easily mean 200000 cores more important though we’ve seen a lot of improvement in mathematical libraries and tools for using gpus we may also see the use of asics and fpgas applicationspecific integrated circuit and fieldprogrammable gate arrays in future ai engines in turn asics and fpgas will be critical to embedding ai in hardware systems many of which think autonomous vehicles will need to run in hard realtimebut even if the hardware is better we will still need algorithms that can be distributed across thousands or millions of nodes we will need algorithms that can reprogram fpgas on the fly to adapt the hardware to the problems they are solving mapreduce became popular for data analysis because it suggested a way to parallelize a large class of problems parallelism obviously works for ai but what are its limits the hard fact of parallelism is that the part of the program that can’t be parallelized kills you and the hallmark of most parallel algorithms is that you need a phase that collects partial results and generates a single result alphago may look at thousands of alternatives when computing its next move but at some point it needs to look at all the alternatives evaluate which is best and present a single result alphago can take advantage of 280 gpus what about a machine with 280000 after all the largest ai systems we’ve built so far are a small fraction of the size of a rat brain let alone a human brain what about algorithms that don’t lend themselves to parallelism as well as neural networks how do you apply feedback in systems where each element of the pipeline is taking a different approach to the problem questions like these are likely to drive ai research in the near futurethrowing more and faster hardware at ai algorithms is likely to get us better go chess and jeopardy players we’ll be able to classify images better and faster but that’s an improvement in the problems we can currently solve will more computing power get us from supervised to unsupervised learning will it lead us from narrow intelligence to general intelligence that remains to be seen unsupervised learning is a hard problem and it’s not clear that it can be solved just by throwing more hardware at it we’re still looking for a “master algorithm” that may not existit is easy to get scared by talk of superhuman intelligence and according to some it is time to decide what we want our machines to do before it’s too late while this position may be oversimplified it is very difficult to think about limiting devices that we can’t build and whose capabilities we can’t imagine now and may never understand in the future it is also difficult to say “no” because i’m not aware of any technology that hasn’t been invented because people thought better of it beforehand at different times in history people were afraid of many technologies that are now commonplace at one point many thought that traveling over 60 miles per hour would be fatal socrates was opposed to writing because he thought it would lead to forgetfulness imagine what he would have thought of our technologybut we can think about the future of ai and how we will develop machines that assist us here are a few suggestionsmost fears of a superintelligent ai aren’t really fears of a machine we neither know or understand they are fears about human nature at its worst coupled with unlimited power we don’t imagine a machine that thinks thoughts we can’t comprehend we imagine an unbeatable hitler or stalin whose thoughts we do comprehend our fears are essentially human fears fears of omnipotent machines acting like humansthat isn’t to denigrate our fears because we’ve seen that machine learning does learn from us microsoft’s unfortunate tay was a tooperfect example of a conversational ai bot that “learned” racism and bigotry from the people it talked to online google’s image classification that identified a black couple as “gorillas” was the result of poor testing and a training set that didn’t have enough properly tagged pictures of black people machines learn to be racist much the same way that humans do because we teach them to be that way whether intentionally or accidentally that’s a human problem and it’s one that’s solvable we can be more careful about what and how our artificial intelligences learn we can be more careful about what’s in our training sets how those sets are tagged and we can filter what kinds of answers we consider acceptable none of this is terribly difficult it just has to be done what’s more difficult in the current climate is reaching a consensus that racism and hatred are not okthat’s a problem of human values not machine intelligence we can build machines that reflect our values we do that already are they the values that we want to reflect the white house’s report on data science big risks big opportunities the intersection of big data and civil rights concludes with a section on the need for research on how to audit algorithms to “ensure that people are being treated fairly” as we move from “big data” to ai the need to audit our algorithms and make sure they reflect values we support will only increaseit is extremely important that research into artificial intelligence be open and visible to the public not because we believe the public will be less “afraid” of research that happens in the open that may or may not be true or because the public will somehow become “used to” the idea of superintelligence but because there is greater concern about research that goes on behind closed doors versus research that goes on in public indeed unethical research suggests that the best way to create a healthy ai ecosystem is to publish ideas for creating malevolent machines research will continue to go on behind closed doors it would be naive to think that military research and intelligence services aren’t working on artificial intelligence but we will be at the mercy of that research if there isn’t also ai research happening in the public sphere whether an organization such as google or facebook constitutes “behind closed doors” or “in public view” is a debate worth having that’s the point of openai “to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole unconstrained by a need to generate financial return” openai is a dramatic and surprising answer to the fear of ai push ai research forward as far as possible but in public make sure that the public sphere remains ahead of closeddoor aiit is also important for research to be open and in the public sphere because research’s origins often determine its application nuclear energy is a good example it’s possible to build safe efficient nuclear reactors that are fueled by thorium but thorium reactors were never built because they don’t help you build bombs and research into nuclear power was under the control of the defense department a reactor that doesn’t generate plutonium in usable quantities why would anyone want that again it’s naive to think that military and national intelligence services won’t do excellent ai research but if ai research becomes the sole province of the military we will have excellent autotargeting drones if ai research becomes the sole province of national intelligence we will have excellent systems for surreptitiously listening to and understanding conversations our imaginations will be limited about what else ai might do for us and we will have trouble imagining ai applications other than murderous drones and the watchful ear of big brother we may never develop intelligent medical systems or robotic nurses’ aidesif we want ai to serve humanity it must be developed in public as part of the larger community of ai researchers and as part of a wider public discourse about our goals and aims we must be careful not to build our own worst nightmare but we need to realize that the nightmare is really just a more powerful version of ourselvesmark zuckerberg recently said that ai will be better than humans at most basic tasks in 5 to 10 years he may be correct but it’s also clear that he’s talking about narrow intelligence specific tasks like speech recognition image classification and of course game playing he continues to say “that doesnt mean that the computers will be thinking” depending on who you talk to a real general intelligence is 10 to 50 years out given the difficulty of predicting the future of technology the best answer is “more than 10 years” and possibly much more when will humanlevel machine intelligence hlmi be achieved a recent survey of experts suggests that hlmi will occur with 50 probability sometime between 20402050 as yann lecun says “humanlevel general ai is several decades away”so when will we get there if ever a few years ago jason huggins hugs made a prescient remark about robots robots he said are always in the future from time to time bits of robotics break off and become part of the present but when that happens they’re no longer considered robotics in the 1920s we would have considered a modern dishwasher a superintelligent robot now it’s just a dishwasherthe same will inevitably happen for artificial intelligence indeed it is already happening i have avoided making a distinction between machine learning and ai “machine learning” is a term that was applied to ideas from ai research back when ai was disreputable now many of those ideas are commonplace we don’t think twice about amazon recommendations or gps navigation systems we take those for granted we may find facebook and google’s ability to tag photos creepy but we don’t think ai when we see it all serious chess players practice against chess programs so do beginning go players and after alphago’s success practicing against a computer will certainly extend to experts these are artificial intelligences that have already broken off and become parts of our world in doing so ai morphed into ia intelligence augmentation autonomous technology that trumped human abilities became assistivewill we ever be able to point to something and say “yes that’s artificial intelligence” yes certainly we can do that now what’s more important is that we will inevitably be surrounded by ai

the latest artificial intelligence innovation in the medical worldartificial intelligence may be just as good at detecting the spread of breast cancer as a specialistthat’s the finding of a by researchers in the netherlandsthe scientists were examining whether artificial intelligence ai in the form of computer algorithms could perform as well as a pathologist when detecting the spread of breast cancer to the lymph nodes in women with the diseasethe researchers said they were stunned by what they found“ai is increasingly being recognized as a major element of the healthcare landscape we are now at a turning point where ai algorithms perform as well as or better than clinicians at specific tasks but still i did not expect such remarkable results at this early stage we showed that stateoftheart ai algorithms perform as well as or better than pathologists in detecting the spread of breast cancer to lymph nodes” babak ehteshami bejnordi an author of the study told healthlinebejnordi and his colleagues from the radboud university medical center in nijmegen in the netherlands first produced computer algorithms to detect the spread of breast cancer as part of an international challenge in 2016the computer algorithms analyze tissue slides of sentinel lymph nodesthose are the lymph nodes that are closest to a tumor and the first place cancer would be likely to spreadin this study the researchers compared the performance of the algorithms against the performance of 11 pathologists who participated in a simulation exercisethey found that some of the algorithms were better than pathologists at detecting the spread of cancer in an exercise with time constraintswithout time constraints some algorithms were as good as a pathologist in detecting the spread of canceralthough the evaluations that took place in this study still need to be undertaken in a clinical setting to determine if the same results can be achieved bejnordi says the use of ai in pathology could take a lot of pressure off specialists“detection of cancer metastases in lymph node tissue is a complex tedious and timeconsuming task pathologists may easily miss small metastases during diagnosis diagnosis of certain types of metastases such as metastases originating from lobular carcinoma can be notoriously difficult and errorprone ai systems in contrast do not get exhausted and always make the same objective interpretation and therefore can aid the pathologists in their decisionmaking” he saidartificial intelligence is present in many aspects of modern lifespeech recognition computer chess games and autonomous driving cars are just some of the ways in which ai is usedthe use of ai in medicine has taken a while to catch on but in the past few years the implementation of the technology has seen a rapid accelerationin an that accompanied bejnordi’s study dr jeffrey alan golden chair of the department of pathology at brigham and women’s hospital in boston notes that “in 2014 the acquisition of ai startups in healthcare was about 600 million in 2021 it is anticipated to be 66 billion or a 40 percent compound annual growth rate”ai involves the science and engineering that enables intelligent computer systems to perform tasks that require human intelligenceput another way ai helps machines think and learngolden believes there are numerous opportunities for this technology in medicine“one of the reasons medicine is so attractive is that the discipline has collected so much information or data on patients that it is impossible for a single person to integrate all of it into hisher thinking a computer will likely be able to do so and use the data more effectively in helping guide physicians and other healthcare workers in the future” golden told healthlineai may assist in improving diagnostics but golden believes human doctors will never be replaced by such technology“looking into the future i do not see a scenario where computers replace human doctors instead they will make them better more efficient and safer i view ai as a tool in the tool chest that healthcare works will be able to use to improve diagnosis prognosis treatment stratification and the definition of intermediate treatment measures it will assist and improve our ability to improve healthcare it will be able to do analyses not possible by physicians however other things it will not be able to do” he told healthlinebejnordi agrees that ai will likely never completely replace doctors but will work alongside them and improve the efficiency of human doctors he also anticipates that incorporating ai in a clinical setting will streamline the workflow of practitioners“the introduction of ai will soon offer a paradigm shift in how clinicians work offering a major opportunity to boost workflow efficiency while at the same time allowing for more accurate and definitive diagnoses” he said“robust evaluations” of ai technology he says will be necessary for clinicians to trust the use of such technologydr michael blum director of the university of california san francisco ucsf center for digital health innovation says evaluations in a clinical setting are crucial for ensuring ai performs as intended“as with every new technology it will take some time to determine the best uses in healthcare and to work out the kinks as the algorithms evolve out of the development space there will need to be rigorous clinical validation to ensure that they function as intended and do not create unintended consequences” he saidbejnordi and his colleagues are hopeful the algorithms they have devised will perform well in clinical studieshe believes it won’t be long until such technology is used around the world“what matters most is providing the best care for patients if the results of our clinical evaluations show that using ai makes us become more accurate efficient and confident in our diagnoses it becomes

how a machine can thinkmachines such as computers can calculate but calculating is not the same as thinking a chess computer running a program like deeper blue the program that defeated kasparov calculates moves at an amazing speed but it does not think it does not have beliefs or desires it is not consciousthe mathematician alan turing once proposed a test which could be used to settle the question whether a computer met the criteria for being an artificial intelligence that is to say a test which would determine whether the computer was not only able to calculate but also to think as we dothe idea of the test is childishly simple suppose you log onto a chat line you have a conversation with an individual who calls themself daniel how do you know that daniel is not a machine programmed with set responses to the words that you type on the screen if daniel is able to continue to hold up an intelligent conversation respond appropriately to whatever questions you asked then you would conclude that daniel was capable of thinking what turing said was that it is irrelevant whether daniel is a human being or a machine a machine that can do what daniel does is intelligent is capable of thinking by definitionyour question however is how it is possible that a machine like daniel a machine with genuine artificial intelligence could ever existis that a technical question or a philosophical questiondaniels brain is not made of biological tissue but metal silicon and plastic but why should biological tissue be the only material that is capable of producing thoughts on the other hand perhaps you are just as puzzled as i am by the question how a person can thinkdaniel does not have a body as we have he sits motionless on a desk his only action is to spew out words when words are fed in for me that is a serious perhaps fatal objection which is why i am not finally convinced by the turing test i share the view held by a number of researchers in this area that a genuine artificial intelligence would have to possess something analogous to arms and legs eyes and ears i would have to be an agent and not merely a language usergeoffrey klempnerbackray askedevaluate computationalism as an account of the mindlet me acquaint you with an incontrovertible factthe mind is not a computerstrictly speaking thats the end of the evaluation however it is probably not unimportant to add that claims to the contrary require the burden of proof to be shifted onto the shoulders of those who make them but to date noone has put together an even halfway convincing caseill put a couple of idea into your head further below but le me finish the present train of thought first fifty years ago similar notions were touted about the mind being a like a telephone exchange and fifty years before that it was a more sophisticated variety of electromotor and so on you can see from this that whatever the present pinnacle of human invention happens to be immediately suggests itself as an analogue of the mind but the mind need i remind you is neither an electromotor nor a telephone exchange nor even remotely like either of these and the case for computers is not a jot better or more plausible for not only is the mind not a computer but it is not software either and calling the brain and its contents hardware is just as farfetchednow im not saying all these negative things to scare you away fat chance nor is it my intention to belittle the truly worthwhile research done by hundreds and perhaps thousands of earnest scientists into artificial intelligence — after all the benefits are all around us and they are meaningful but one has to draw a line somewhere between research and the broadcasting of ideas that inadequate as they are still harbour the possibility of dehumanising the idea of human intelligence and to do so from a basis of utterly inadequate evidence thats my point and im not the only one making it and i wish people would start to listen before it is too late there is a sinister joke around about computers that the greatest danger for us is not that computers might begin to think like us but that we will begin to think like computersin the end the truth about computational theories of the mind is that neurologists and biologists ie the people who study life in the raw not on a computer screen would

things that make a living out of constructing bodies and brains and lungs and skin now being alive means of course that they are vulnerable to disease to shortages of food to tiredness and all the other problems that beset life forms and eventually they grow old and die ask yourself what happens to a computer when the algorithm looks for a memory address and cant find it hang up in the brain some 10000 cells die every day would you like to write a program for a computer where you are not allowed to define a certain cell as memory x for fear that it might be dead tomorrow with the rate of fatality ive just noted how many times do you suppose your brain computer would hang up on an average day do you think you or any of us would be around today to discuss this problem2 okay you might want to answer surely theres got to be a way after all the brain does work as a sort of information processing device even if our terminology is a bit nave now i might be inclined to accept that point but again with considerable reservations because it is commonly accepted theory that the brain as an intelligence device works by parallel distributed processing computers as you know work by digital processing these two methods are as different as chalk and cheese and while we do understand a great deal about the way the brain does its parallel processing it is not a theory that is easily portable into machines with all our sophistication we are stuck on the problem that the only truly parallel distributing intelligence system is in fact the brain what we can simulate by means of batteries of cpus strung up together is a very poor substitute and in any case a bit of a cheatbut this being the case we are back to where we started if the brain is a parallel processing information device if the only truly parallel processing system known to us is the brain and if the brain is part of the biological partition of the universe then there is no warrant for holding that computationalism as an account of the mind has a hope in hades of being a true accounti dont know what age you are and so it is a little difficult to recommend something for you to read a great deal

iswhen we answer the questions set in pathways with only the web site as silent witness we are in a similar position to that occupied by a questioner and responder in alan turings famous test for determining machine intelligence in this test if the answers sent back to the questioner could not be distinguished from the answers a human would send then we could conclude that the machine is responding as intelligently as a human would so that we could not be sure if the sender is a living human or a nonliving machinein the game we are playing we cant be sure if questioner or the answer provider is taking the position of the machine or if in fact there are only machines communicating i am pretty certain that if i am a machine then i am indistinguishable from every other human machine furthermore if i thought i was responding to a nonhuman machine the kind of answer i would give would be different to the kind of answer i would give if i thought the receiver was human and i also had some idea of the context in which the question was being asked i could with no concern for the consequences of the discussion pursue an analysis of the concept of being alive if the analysis was only a word game but if the philosopherplayer believes there could be life changing consequences for the questionerplayer there should be constraints on the scope of the answer providedwhat follows from these considerations is that philosophical investigations that take on practical issues ought to work on a principle of nonindifference with respect to the learning and actions that may follow from the interchangesuppose that peter is a pseudonym for a woman in the uk who is currently seeking the right to die because she does not want to continue her life in a severely reduced and dependent form she is alive but not independently alive should the correct philosophical turing response be to neutrally elicit from the questioner what her understanding is of the phrase to be alive as she was before her present condition what it is now and what she thinks it will be given the questioners position would it also for the sake of logical completeness be the correct response to offer interpretations of the key phrase not included in her perspective and persuade her that she may not choose to reject some of those meanings for a person in this position the question we are thinking about is clearly very heavily weighted with both issues of fact and issues of value so that a logicolinguistic approach to the analysis of the question may only provide one approach to unfolding the complexities of the issue or even changing mindsif the questioner has full mental competence as in fact the individual in question does then descartes might try and persuade her that she is no less alive in her present position than she was before given the belief that the essence of being is thinking if thinking though was not a source of satisfaction either because it was not something she particularly excelled in or practiced very often or it was not something that she would place in her list of preferences then an approach that would compliment the previous one mentioned would be to elicit from the questioner what are the satisfactions and nonsatisfactions of being alivethe turing pgame has now altered so that it is not simply a matter of discrete question response evaluation decision and closure but more a continuum of interchange in which information ideas questions learning and teaching are flowing in both directions but if the elicitation of knowledge in the context of a philosophical investigation has the form of a directed interview then the philosopher should have some idea about the direction the interview can be steered in and those it should not in the context of a philosophical and not legal or medical inquiry or any other kind of inquiry the practical philosopher should be aware of what has been in the history of ideas considered to be sources of satisfaction for individuals in being alive but they can also take an alternative more general approach of considering individual satisfaction to be an indivisible part of dualistic satisfaction decisions then relating to being alive or choosing to not be alive then become inseparable from how the satisfaction and nonsatisfaction of others are affected either as classes of individuals such as relatives such as husbands wives children or parents others in similar positions now or in the future or others in the abstract as represented in medicine as the abstract entity the patient the defendant in law the social services client the child in family law the therapy clientin answering this question i felt that it was necessary to first talk about the logical delicacy of philosophical investigations conducted blind and suggested that the philosopher player should work within the ground rules of nonindifference in such contextssecondly i have suggested that in the context of the questionerplayer making life changing decisions as a consequence of the game then the philosopherplayer can use a variety of techniques for practical philosophyfinally it also seems to me that given the tendency of most individuals in the position of questioner producer answer provider or both to make two kinds of cognitive mistake of scale at some time due to stress material or political circumstances which can be characterised as mistakes of over generalisation and mistakes of under discrimination then all philosophical investigations should be conducted within the constraints of

relativism ethical dilemmas ethical dilemmas on amazon social justice further study philosophy and scifi the ten big questions artificial intelligence monique asked can you explain to me how a machine can think machines such as computers can calculate but calculating is not the same as thinking a chess computer running a program like deeper blue the program that defeated kasparov calculates moves at an amazing speed but it does not think it does not have beliefs or desires it is not conscious the mathematician alan turing once proposed a test which could be used to settle the question whether a computer met the criteria for being an artificial intelligence that is to say a test which would determine whether the computer was not only able to calculate but also to think as we do the idea of the test is childishly simple suppose you log onto a chat line you have a conversation with an individual who calls themself daniel how do you know that daniel is not a machine programmed with set responses to the words that you type on the screen if daniel is able to continue to hold up an intelligent conversation respond appropriately to whatever questions you asked then you would conclude that daniel was capable of thinking what turing said was that it is irrelevant whether daniel is a human being or a machine a machine that can do what daniel does is intelligent is capable of thinking by definition your question however is how it is possible that a machine like daniel a machine with genuine artificial intelligence could ever exist is that a technical question or a philosophical question daniels brain is not made of biological tissue but metal silicon and plastic but why should biological tissue be the only material that is capable of producing thoughts on the other hand perhaps you are just as puzzled as i am by the question how a person can think daniel does not have a body as we have he sits motionless on a desk his only action is to spew out words when words are fed in for me that is a serious perhaps fatal objection which is why i am not finally convinced by the turing test i share the view held by a number of researchers in this area that a genuine artificial intelligence would have to possess something analogous to arms and legs eyes and ears i would have to be an agent and not merely a language user geoffrey klempner back ray asked evaluate computationalism as an account of the mind let me acquaint you with an incontrovertible fact the mind is not a computer strictly speaking thats the end of the evaluation however it is probably not unimportant to add that claims to the contrary require the burden of proof to be shifted onto the shoulders of those who make them but to date noone has put together an even halfway convincing case ill put a couple of idea into your head further below but le me finish the present train of thought first fifty years ago similar notions were touted about the mind being a like a telephone exchange and fifty years before that it was a more sophisticated variety of electromotor and so on you can see from this that whatever the present pinnacle of human invention happens to be immediately suggests itself as an analogue of the mind but the mind need i remind you is neither an electromotor nor a telephone exchange nor even remotely like either of these and the case for computers is not a jot better or more plausible for not only is the mind not a computer but it is not software either and calling the brain and its contents hardware is just as farfetched now im not saying all these negative things to scare you away fat chance nor is it my intention to belittle the truly worthwhile research done by hundreds and perhaps thousands of earnest scientists into artificial intelligence — after all the benefits are all around us and they are meaningful but one has to draw a line somewhere between research and the broadcasting of ideas that inadequate as they are still harbour the possibility of dehumanising the idea of human intelligence and to do so from a basis of utterly inadequate evidence thats my point and im not the only one making it and i wish people would start to listen before it is too late there is a sinister joke around about computers that the greatest danger for us is not that computers might begin to think like us but that we will begin to think like

could boost retail profitability by 60 percent by reducing marketing costsshutterstock peshkovathe history of sales and marketing is really about the evolution of choice the earliest humans ate — and wore — what they could find or kill their choices were limited by their abilities and their environmentas settlement and agriculture produced greater surpluses that could be bartered or traded or sold options expanded competition for that excess production grew and marketing emerged as an essential differentiator between those who went home happy — or hungryfastforward to the digital era the choices available are virtually — and actually — limitless variable design pricing sizing coloring availability and immediate — free — delivery anywhere at any time are not just possible they have become baked into consumer expectationsbut a notsofunny thing happened on the way to the digital forum the enterprises that increasingly dominate what customers see and therefore buy have discovered that reducing choice may improve sales and enhance margins the reason is that the data that every transaction in fact every searchable click throws off provides insights as to what might inspire the consumer to buy rather than merely view and that information has become the key to the new economyto optimize the monetization of those insights reducing the complexity and consequent time and cost of the interaction becomes essential the keys to those increases in productivity and possibility are machinelearning and artificial intelligence both fueled by the tsunami of data now captured by and sloshing through every digital activity what merchants and marketers are learning is that limiting choices in what their customers see may increase their likelihood to buy the seller is now able to “curate” the field of options in order to present only those products or services the data suggest will stimulate individual sales activity and those individual limits will be grossed up into a strategy based on mass customizationthe benefits are potentially significant some estimates postulate that artificial intelligence could boost retail profitability by as much as 60 percent by reducing marketing costs while improving sales through more precise targeting of shoppers and their desiresamazon go the cashierless retail business started last year by its parent company amazon is an exemplar of this trend the store provides a limited offering of “essentials” for the urbanite on the go selected after extensive data analysis every bit of data is extracted not just what is purchased based on a system of preregistration of mobile identification then gathered and charged as the shopper exits but what is picked off the shelf and examined even if not purchased securities analysts speculate that it could be a 4 billion a year business by 2021 three years after its launchjonathan low courtesyother companies are attempting similar efforts to focus consumers on the products the merchant and its supply chain partners want her or him to see supermarket giant kroger is testing software to help customers complete their shopping lists by suggesting items in store that they have either purchased in the past or that data analysis shows other shoppers have chosen when buying products already in this customer’s cart the company is introducing a new system that highlights products on shelves as customers pass identifying brands it is hoped the shopper will purchase based on the store’s supplier arrangements margin requirements advertising promotions andor previous customer preferencesthe opportunities for exponential growth of such prescriptive marketing programs appear strong currently only 22 percent of apparel 30 percent of electronics — and a mere 3 percent of groceries — are purchased online the expectation is that by further “focusing” — a word far less freighted with orwellian overtones than “limiting” “restricting” or “curtailing” — customer options and assumptions merchants can increase the percentage of purchases completed electronically whether online or instorethe reality is that these efforts may appear almost quaintly referential compared to even newer schemes which some concerned observers are deeming coercive the advent of smart speakers with virtual assistants has created new possibilities for marketers hoping to anticipate and shape consumer behavior a first step could be to have alexa or siri or any of their companions recommend purchases based on timing and records of previous use the next step would be to empower the device — and the algorithms that manage it — to make those purchases and arrange their delivery without the owner’s explicit commandthe operational financial and legal implications of such actions can only be imagined right now though it is safe to assume that they are being studied by interested partiesthe overarching hypothesis appears to be that choice no longer possesses the same value to shoppers as it once did that in effect convenience and curation will prevail over serendipity and selectionthe question though is not just whether that assumption is correct but whether it will ultimately be better for marketing for retail for fashion and all of the other segments of commerce in which choice has played such an important role in stimulating global economic growthusers of technology in their role as consumers may appreciate the speed and ease of use but will they eventually grow tired of the curated selections made available to themwill those users and purchasers begin to sense that prices and the resultant costbenefit calculations by which they have run their lives are increasingly being determined by systems in which their voice is no longer necessary let alone valuedwill merchants see their own growth stunted by the financial demands of a system based solely on calculations like return on equity in which their own creative and economic opportunities are limited by the decisions of others higher up the proverbial food chainwill such processes concentrate too much power in too few hands and will that lead inevitably to abuse of the authority vested in those who dominate itfrustration with the role of big tech firms like amazon google and facebook has already been on the rise across the world and some of that resentment is driven by the understanding if not actual knowledge which largely remains a closely guarded secret for good competitive and publicrelationsdriven reasons that choices are already being constrained in ways that affect how — and how well — people are able to live as well as how their opportunities are being determined by othersit may be that the impact of curation and convenience on choice will prove too restrictive to be sustainable in a world succored by limitless information that encourages human agency and enterprisechoice has over time nurtured the grandest of human aspirations such as freedom prosperity and safety and it may just be too deeply inculcated in the human spirit to be severely curtailed or even eliminated but given the forces pushing commerce in the direction of limitation it may well be that the only way humanity in its roles as consumer and citizen will find that out is when choice’s absence is experiencedbusinessclock 17h • sharon edelsonget all the top news stories and

expected precipitation soil quality and other agricultural data to determine how to maximize yields for each plot if a rainy cold front is expected to pass by heepke knows which areas to avoid watering or irrigating that afternoon as the us department of agriculture noted this use of artificial intelligence across the industry has produced the largest crops in the country’s historyclimate corporation the silicon valley–based developer of climate basic also offers a more advanced ai app that operates autonomously if a storm hits a region or a drought occurs it adjusts local yield numbers downward farmers who have bought insurance to supplement their government coverage get a check no questions asked no paper filing necessary the insurance companies and farmers both benefit from having a much less laborintensive more streamlined and less expensive automated claims processmonsanto paid nearly us1 billion to buy climate corporation in 2013 giving the company’s models added legitimacy since then monsanto has continued to upgrade the ai models integrating data from farm equipment and sensors planted in the fields so that they improve their accuracy and insight as more data is fed into them one result is a better understanding of climate change and its effects — for example the northward migration of arable land for corn or the increasing frequency of severe stormsapplications like this are typical of the new wave of artificial intelligence in business ai is generating new approaches to business models operations and the deployment of people that are likely to fundamentally change the way business operates and if it can transform an earthbound industry like agriculture how long will it be before your company is affectedmany business leaders are keenly aware of the potential value of artificial intelligence but are not yet poised to take advantage of it in pwc’s 2017 digital iq survey of senior executives worldwide 54 percent of the respondents said they were making substantial investments in ai today but only 20 percent said their organizations had the skills necessary to succeed with this technology see “winning with digital confidence” by chris curran and tom puthiyamadamreports on artificial intelligence tend to portray it as either a servant making all technology more responsive or an overlord eliminating jobs and destroying privacy but for business decision makers ai is primarily an enabler of productivity it will eliminate jobs to be sure but it will also fundamentally change work processes and might create jobs in the long run the nature of decision making collaboration creative art and scientific research will all be affected so will enterprise structures technological systems including potentially your products and services as well as your office and factory equipment will respond to people and one another in ways that feel as if they are coming to lifetechnological systems will respond to people and one another in ways that feel as if they are coming to lifein their book artificial intelligence a modern approach pearson 1995 stuart russell and peter norvig define ai as “the designing and building of intelligent agents that receive percepts from the environment and take actions that affect that environment” the most critical difference between ai and generalpurpose software is in the phrase “take actions” ai enables machines to respond on their own to signals from the world at large signals that programmers do not directly control and therefore can’t anticipatethe fastestgrowing category of ai is machine learning or the ability of software to improve its own activity by analyzing interactions with the world at large see “the road to deep learning” below this technology which has been a continual force in the history of computing since the 1940s has grown dramatically in sophistication during the last few yearsthis may be the first moment in ai’s history when a majority of experts agree the technology has practical value from its conceptual beginnings in the 1950s led by legendary computer scientists such as marvin minsky and john mccarthy its future viability has been the subject of fierce debate as recently as 2000 the most proficient ai system was roughly comparable in complexity to the brain of a worm then as highbandwidth networking cloud computing and highpowered graphicsenabled microprocessors emerged researchers began building multilayered neural networks — still extremely slow and limited in comparison with natural brains but useful in practical waysthe bestknown ai triumphs — in which software systems beat expert human players in jeopardy chess go poker and soccer — differ from most daytoday business applications these games have prescribed rules and welldefined outcomes every game ends in a win loss or tie the games are also closedloop systems they affect only the players not outsiders the software can be trained through multiple failures with no serious risks you can’t say the same of an autonomous vehicle crash a factory failure or a mistranslationthere are currently two main schools of thought on how to develop the inference capabilities necessary for ai programs to navigate through the complexities of everyday life in both programs learn from experience — that is the responses and reactions they get influence the way the programs act thereafter the first approach uses conditional instructions also known as heuristics to accomplish this for instance an ai bot would interpret the emotions in a conversation by following a program that instructed it to start by checking for emotions that were evident in the recent pastthe second approach is known as machine learning the machine is taught using specific examples to make inferences about the world around it it then builds its understanding through this inferencemaking ability without following specific instructions to do so the google search engine’s “nextword completion” feature is a good example of machine learning type in the word artificial and several suggestions for the next word will appear perhaps intelligence selection and insemination no one has programmed it to seek those complements google chose the strategy of looking for the three words most frequently typed after artificial with huge amounts of data available machine learning can provide uncanny accuracy about patterns of behaviorthe type of machine learning called deep learning has become increasingly important a deep learning system is a multilayered neural network that learns representations of the world and stores them as a nested hierarchy of concepts many layers deep for example when processing thousands of images it recognizes objects based on a hierarchy of simpler building blocks straight lines and curved lines at the basic level then eyes mouths and noses and then faces and then specific facial features besides image recognition deep learning appears to be a promising way to approach complex challenges such as speech comprehension human–machine conversation language translation and vehicle navigation see exhibit athough it is the closest machine to a human brain a deep learning neural network is not suitable for all problems it requires multiple processors with enormous computing power far beyond conventional it architecture it will learn only by processing enormous amounts of data and its decision processes are not transparentnews aggregation software for example had long relied on rudimentary ai to curate articles based on people’s requests then it evolved to analyze behavior tracking the way people clicked on articles and the time they spent reading and adjusting the selections accordingly next it aggregated individual users’ behavior with the larger population particularly those who had similar media habits now it is incorporating broader data about the way readers’ interests change over time to anticipate what people are likely to want to see next even if they have never clicked on that topic before tomorrow’s ai aggregators will be able to detect and counter “fake news” by scanning for inconsistencies and routing people to alternative perspectivestomorrow’s ai aggregators will be able to detect “fake news” and route people to alternative perspectivesai applications in daily use include all smartphone digital assistants email programs that sort entries by importance voice recognition systems image recognition apps such as facebook picture search digital assistants such as amazon echo and google home and much of the emerging industrial internet some ai apps are targeted at minor frustrations — donotpay an online legal bot has reversed thousands of parking tickets — and others such as connected car and language translation technologies represent fundamental shifts in the way people live a growing number are aimed at improving human behavior for instance gm’s 2016 chevrolet malibu feeds data from sensors into a backseat driver–like guidance system for teenagers at the wheeldespite all this activity the market for ai is still small market research firm tractica estimated 2016 revenues at just 644 million but it expects hockey stick–style growth reaching 15 billion by 2022 and accelerating thereafter in late 2016 there were about 1500 airelated startups in the us alone and total funding in 2016 reached a record 5 billion google facebook microsoft salesforcecom and other tech companies are snapping up ai software companies and large established companies are recruiting deep learning talent and like monsanto buying ai companies specializing in their markets to make the most of this technology in your enterprise consider the three main ways that businesses can or will use ai• assisted intelligence now widely available improves what people and organizations are already doing• augmented intelligence emerging today enables organizations and people to do things they couldn’t otherwise do• autonomous intelligence being developed for the future creates and deploys machines that act on their ownmany companies will make investments in all three during the next few years drawing from a wide variety of applications see exhibit 1 they complement one another but require different types of investment different staffing considerations and different business modelsassisted intelligence amplifies the value of existing activity for example google’s gmail sorts incoming email into “primary” “social” and “promotion” default tabs the algorithm trained with data from millions of other users’ emails makes people more efficient without changing the way they use email or altering the value it providesin late 2016 there were about 1500 airelated startups in the us alone and total funding in 2016 reached a record 5 billion markassisted intelligence tends to involve clearly defined rulesbased repeatable tasks these include automated assembly lines and other uses of physical robots robotic process automation in which softwarebased agents simulate the online activities of a human being and backoffice functions such as billing finance and regulatory compliance this form of ai can be used to verify and crosscheck data — for example when paper checks are read and verified by a bank’s atm assisted intelligence has already become common in some enterprise software processes in “opportunity to order” basic sales and “order to cash” receiving and processing customer orders the software offers guidance and direction that was formerly available only from peoplethe oscar w larson company used assisted intelligence to improve its field service operations this is a 70plusyearold familyowned general contractor which among other services to the oil and gas industry provides maintenance and repair for pointofsales systems and fuel dispensers at gas stations one costly and irritating problem is “truck rerolls” service calls that have to be rescheduled because the technician lacks the tools parts or expertise for a particular issue after analyzing data on service calls the ai software showed how to reduce truck rerolls by 20 percent a rate that should continue to improve as the software learns to recognize more patternsassisted intelligence apps often involve computer models of complex realities that allow businesses to test decisions with less risk for example one auto manufacturer has developed a simulation of consumer behavior incorporating data about the types of trips people make the ways those affect supply and demand for motor vehicles and the variations in those patterns for different city topologies marketing approaches and vehicle price ranges the model spells out more than 200000 variations for the automaker to consider and simulates the potential success of any tested variation thus assisting in the design of car launches as the automaker introduces new cars and the simulator incorporates the data on outcomes from each launch the model’s predictions will become ever more accurateaibased packages of this sort are available on more and more enterprise software platforms success with assisted intelligence should lead to improvements in conventional business metrics such as labor productivity revenues or margins per employee and average time to completion for processes much of the cost involved is in the staff you hire who must be skilled at marshaling and interpreting data to evaluate where to deploy assisted intelligence consider two questions what products or services could you easily make more marketable if they were more automatically responsive to your customers which of your current processes and practices including your decisionmaking practices would be more powerful with more intelligenceaugmented intelligence software lends new capability to human activity permitting enterprises to do things they couldn’t do before unlike assisted intelligence it fundamentally alters the nature of the task and business models change accordinglyfor example netflix uses machine learning algorithms to do something media has never done before suggest choices customers would probably not have found themselves based not just on the customer’s patterns of behavior but on those of the audience at large a netflix user unlike a cable tv payperview customer can easily switch from one premium video to another without penalty after just a few minutes this gives consumers more control over their time they use it to choose videos more tailored to the way they feel at any given moment every time that happens the system records that observation and adjusts its recommendation list — and it enables netflix to tailor its next round of videos to user preferences more accurately this leads to reduced costs and higher profits per movie and a more enthusiastic audience which then enables more investments in personalization and ai left outside this virtuous circle are conventional advertising and television networks no wonder other video channels such as hbo and amazon as well as recorded music channels such as spotify have moved to similar modelsover time as algorithms grow more sophisticated the symbiotic relationship between human and ai will further change entertainment industry practices the unit of viewing decision will probably become the scene not the story algorithms will link scenes to audience emotions a consumer might ask to see only scenes where a meryl streep character is falling in love or to trace a particular type of swordplay from one action movie to another data accumulating from these choices will further refine the ability of the entertainment industry to spark people’s emotions satisfy their curiosity and gain their loyaltyanother current use of augmented intelligence is in legal research though most cases are searchable online finding relevant precedents still requires many hours of sifting through past opinions luminance a startup specializing in legal research can run through thousands of cases in a very short time providing inferences about their relevance to a current proceeding systems like these don’t yet replace human legal research but they dramatically reduce the rote work conducted by associate attorneys a job rated as the least satisfying in the united states similar applications are emerging for other types of data sifting including financial audits interpreting regulations finding patterns in epidemiological data and as noted above farmingto develop applications like these you’ll need to marshal your own imagination to look for products services or processes that would not be possible at all without ai for example an ai system can track a wide number of product features warranty costs repeat purchase rates and more general purchasing metrics bringing only unusual or noteworthy correlations to your attention are a high number of repairs associated with a particular region material or line of products could you use this information to redesign your products avoid recalls or spark innovation in some waythe success of an augmented intelligence effort depends on whether it has enabled your company to do new things to assess this capability track your margins innovation cycles customer experience and revenue growth as potential proxies also watch your impact on disruption are your new innovations doing to some part of the business ecosystem what say ridehailing services are doing to conventional taxi companiesyou won’t find many offtheshelf applications for augmented intelligence they involve advanced forms of machine learning and natural language processing plus specialized interfaces tailored to your company and industry however you can build bespoke augmented intelligence applications on cloudbased enterprise platforms most of which allow modifications in open source code given the unstructured nature of your most critical decision processes an augmented intelligence application would require voluminous historical data from your own company along with data from the rest of your industry and related fields such as demographics this will help the system distinguish external factors such as competition and economic conditions from the impact of your own decisionsthe greatest change from augmented intelligence may be felt by senior decision makers as the new models often give them new alternatives to consider that don’t match their past experience or gut feelings they should be open to those alternatives but also skeptical ai systems are not infallible just like any human guide they must show consistency explain their decisions and counter biases or they will lose their valuevery few autonomous intelligence systems — systems that make decisions without direct human involvement or oversight — are in widespread use today early examples include automated trading in the stock market about 75 percent of nasdaq trading is conducted autonomously and facial recognition in some circumstances algorithms are better than people at identifying other people other early examples include robots that dispose of bombs gather deepsea data maintain space stations and perform other tasks inherently unsafe for peoplethe most eagerly anticipated forms of autonomous intelligence — selfdriving cars and fullfledged language translation programs — are not yet ready for general use the closest autonomous service so far is tencent’s messaging and social media platform wechat which has close to 800 million daily active users most of them in china the program which was designed primarily for use on smartphones offers relatively sophisticated voice recognition chinesetoenglish language translation facial recognition including suggestions of celebrities who look like the person holding the phone and virtual bot friends that can play guessing games notwithstanding their cleverness and their pioneering use of natural language processing these are still niche applications and still very limited by technology some of the most popular ai apps for example are small menu and ruledriven programs which conduct fairly rudimentary conversations around a limited group of optionsdespite the lead time required to bring the technology further along any business prepared to base a strategy on advanced digital technology should be thinking seriously about autonomous intelligence now the internet of things will generate vast amounts of information more than humans can reasonably interpret in commercial aircraft for example so much flight data is gathered that engineers can’t process it all thus boeing has announced a 75 million partnership with carnegie mellon university along with other efforts to develop ai systems that can for example predict when airplanes will need maintenance autonomous intelligence’s greatest challenge may not be technological at all — it may be companies’ ability to build in enough transparency for people to trust these systems to act in their best interestas you contemplate the introduction of artificial intelligence articulate what mix of the three approaches works best for you• are you primarily interested in upgrading your existing processes reducing costs and improving productivity if so then start with assisted intelligence probably with a small group of services from a cloudbased provider• do you seek to build your business around something new — responsive and selfdriven products or services and experiences that incorporate ai then pursue an augmented intelligence approach probably with more complex ai applications resident on the cloud• are you developing a genuinely new technology most companies will be better off primarily using someone else’s ai platforms but if you can justify building your own you may become one of the leaders in your marketthe transition among these forms of ai is not cleancut they sit on a continuum in developing their own ai strategy many companies begin somewhere between assisted and augmented while expecting to move toward autonomous eventually see exhibit 2though investments in ai may seem expensive now the costs will decline over the next 10 years as the software becomes more commoditized “as this technology continues to mature” writes daniel eckert a managing director in emerging technology services for pwc us “we should see the price adhere toward a utility model and flatten out we expect a tiered pricing model to be introduced a free or freemium model for simple activities and a premium model for discrete businessdifferentiating services”ai is often sold on the premise that it will replace human labor at lower cost — and the effect on employment could be devastating though no one knows for sure carl benedikt frey and michael osborne of oxford university’s engineering school have calculated that ai will put 47 percent of the jobs in the us at risk a 2016 forrester research report estimated it at 6 percent at least by 2025 on the other hand baidu research head and deep learning pioneer andrew ng recently said “ai is the new electricity” meaning that it will be found everywhere and create new jobs that weren’t imaginable before its appearanceat the same time that ai threatens the loss of an almost unimaginable number of jobs it is also a hungry unsatisfied employer the lack of capable talent — people skilled in deep learning technology and analytics — may well turn out to be the biggest obstacle for large companies the greatest opportunities may thus be for independent businesspeople including farmers like jeff heepke who no longer need scale to compete with large companies because ai has leveled the playing fieldit is still too early to say which types of companies will be the most successful in this area — and we don’t yet have an ai model to predict it for us in the end we cannot even say for sure that the companies that enter the field first will be the most successful the dominant players will be those that like climate corporation oscar w larson netflix and many other companies large and small have taken ai to heart as a way to become far more capable in a far more relevant way than they otherwise would ever bereprint no 17210articles published in strategybusiness do not necessarily represent the views of

artificial intelligence task force over the next 90 days in an effort to help develop needed expertise and better prepare for the service for the future of warfare says lt gen bruce crawford usa army chief information officer the service also is creating a cloud computing advisory boardgen crawford mentioned the potential task force during the afcea technet augusta conference in augusta georgia he tied the task force to the defense department’s creation of an joint artificial intelligence center jaic an effort being led by the department’s cio dana deasy“our leadership across the department in response to the national defense strategy is in the process of standing up a joint ai center” told the conference audiencethe army cio noted that the military services support the jaic “i don’t know how many of my fellow cios from across the services are in here but i think i can speak for them and say that we’re all in when it comes to this concept being developed by the department” he reportedbut the army has some work to do to in preparation for the jaic “internal to the army in the next 90 days you’ll likely see the stand up of an ai task force” gen crawford reportedthat task force he added will help army officials “really get our mind around the specific skillsets that we’re going to need to be relevant and to thrive in this environment that will include ai and machine learning” the army leadership he noted understands and acknowledges the service does not have “the institutional knowledge to deliver on the strategy”ltg bruce crawford armyciog6 says that in the coming months will see army leaders articulating how they get to modernizationafceatechnet— george seffers gseffers august 22 2018he said the army mission command center of excellence already is adding some publications including training manuals and tactics techniques and procedures ttps to artificial intelligence systems “there’s going to come a day when you can ask a question of a device that is going to give you a comparative analysis between a lot of the ttps that are out there and lessons learned” he predictedin a brief interview with signal magazine following his presentation gen crawford elaborated “it’s an idea that the army is considering as we account for the standup of the joint ai center at the dod level dod right now is identifying national mission initiatives we’ve got people on their team working with them already we’ve identified the best and brightest that we can find … who are working with them”the task force will help organize the service in preparation for the jaic “this idea of an ai task force is envisioned to allow the army to organize instead of just leaping forward we’re looking to organize ourselves to make sure that we remain in sync with dod and the great work that mr deasy is doing” gen crawford said adding that he applauds deasy for “leading a giant effort”the service also is developing an advisory board for cloud computing “one of the things we’ve done over the last 90 days is that the army is in the process of standing up an advisory board consisting of the best and brightest from commercial industry” the general told signal magazinethe army is using a federally funded research and development center ffrdc to help recruit experts for the advisory board gen crawford said deasy uses a house building analogy to discuss cloud computing “we’ve got a lot of people who know how to build a house what we’re looking for now is people who know how to plan for a community of houses” he said crediting deasyhe added that the advisory organization will help the service determine how to use cloud computing to organize its myriad software applications “as the army starts to proceed and look forward at how we want to organize the 8000 applications that we’ve got—and these are authoritative applications—we’re going to need the talent we want to leverage an ffrdc to lead a red and blue team advisory group so that when we step forward

is the inability to use one’s understanding without guidance from another”—immanuel kant “what is enlightenment” 1784the digital revolution is in full swing how will it change our world the amount of data we produce doubles every year in other words in 2016 we produced as much data as in the entire history of humankind through 2015 every minute we produce hundreds of thousands of google searches and facebook posts these contain information that reveals how we think and feel soon the things around us possibly even our clothing also will be connected with the internet it is estimated that in 10 years’ time there will be 150 billion networked measuring sensors 20 times more than people on earth then the amount of data will double every 12 hours many companies are already trying to turn this big data into big moneyeverything will become intelligent soon we will not only have smart phones but also smart homes smart factories and smart cities should we also expect these developments to result in smart nations and a smarter planetthe field of artificial intelligence is indeed making breathtaking advances in particular it is contributing to the automation of data analysis artificial intelligence is no longer programmed line by line but is now capable of learning thereby continuously developing itself recently googles deepmind algorithm taught itself how to win 49 atari games algorithms can now recognize handwritten language and patterns almost as well as humans and even complete some tasks better than them they are able to describe the contents of photos and videos today 70 of all financial transactions are performed by algorithms news content is in part automatically generated this all has radical economic consequences in the coming 10 to 20 years around half of todays jobs will be threatened by algorithms 40 of todays top 500 companies will have vanished in a decadeit can be expected that supercomputers will soon surpass human capabilities in almost all areas—somewhere between 2020 and 2060 experts are starting to ring alarm bells technology visionaries such as elon musk from tesla motors bill gates from microsoft and apple cofounder steve wozniak are warning that superintelligence is a serious danger for humanity possibly even more dangerous than nuclear weaponsis this alarmismone thing is clear the way in which we organize the economy and society will change fundamentally we are experiencing the largest transformation since the end of the second world war after the automation of production and the creation of selfdriving cars the automation of society is next with this society is at a crossroads which promises great opportunities but also considerable risks if we take the wrong decisions it could threaten our greatest historical achievementsin the 1940s the american mathematician norbert wiener 1894–1964 invented cybernetics according to him the behavior of systems could be controlled by the means of suitable feedbacks very soon some researchers imagined controlling the economy and society according to this basic principle but the necessary technology was not available at that timetoday singapore is seen as a perfect example of a datacontrolled society what started as a program to protect its citizens from terrorism has ended up influencing economic and immigration policy the property market and school curricula china is taking a similar route recently baidu the chinese equivalent of google invited the military to take part in the china brain project it involves running socalled deep learning algorithms over the search engine data collected about its users beyond this a kind of social control is also planned according to recent reports every chinese citizen will receive a socalled ”citizen score” which will determine under what conditions they may get loans jobs or travel visa to other countries this kind of individual monitoring would include people’s internet surfing and the behavior of their social contacts see ”spotlight on china”with consumers facing increasingly frequent credit checks and some online shops experimenting with personalized prices we are on a similar path in the west it is also increasingly clear that we are all in the focus of institutional surveillance this was revealed in 2015 when details of the british secret services karma police program became public showing the comprehensive screening of everyones internet use is big brother now becoming a realityprogrammed society programmed citizenseverything started quite harmlessly search engines and recommendation platforms began to offer us personalised suggestions for products and services this information is based on personal and metadata that has been gathered from previous searches purchases and mobility behaviour as well as social interactions while officially the identity of the user is protected it can in practice be inferred quite easily today algorithms know pretty well what we do what we think and how we feel—possibly even better than our friends and family or even ourselves often the recommendations we are offered fit so well that the resulting decisions feel as if they were our own even though they are actually not our decisions in fact we are being remotely controlled ever more successfully in this manner the more is known about us the less likely our choices are to be free and not predetermined by othersbut it wont stop there some software platforms are moving towards “persuasive computing” in the future using sophisticated manipulation technologies these platforms will be able to steer us through entire courses of action be it for the execution of complex work processes or to generate free content for internet platforms from which corporations earn billions the trend goes from programming computers to programming peoplethese technologies are also becoming increasingly popular in the world of politics under the label of “nudging” and on massive scale governments are trying to steer citizens towards healthier or more environmentally friendly behaviour by means of a nudge—a modern form of paternalism the new caring government is not only interested in what we do but also wants to make sure that we do the things that it considers to be right the magic phrase is big nudging which is the combination of big data with nudging to many this appears to be a sort of digital scepter that allows one to govern the masses efficiently without having to involve citizens in democratic processes could this overcome vested interests and optimize the course of the world if so then citizens could be governed by a dataempowered “wise king” who would be able to produce desired economic and social outcomes almost as if with a digital magic wandpreprogrammed catastrophesbut one look at the relevant scientific literature shows that attempts to control opinions in the sense of their optimization are doomed to fail because of the complexity of the problem the dynamics of the formation of opinions are full of surprises nobody knows how the digital magic wand that is to say the manipulative nudging technique should best be used what would have been the right or wrong measure often is apparent only afterwards during the german swine flu epidemic in 2009 for example everybody was encouraged to go for vaccination however we now know that a certain percentage of those who received the immunization were affected by an unusual disease narcolepsy fortunately there were not more people who chose to get vaccinatedanother example is the recent attempt of health insurance providers to encourage increased exercise by handing out smart fitness bracelets with the aim of reducing the amount of cardiovascular disease in the population but in the end this might result in more hip operations in a complex system such as society an improvement in one area almost inevitably leads to deterioration in another thus largescale interventions can sometimes prove to be massive mistakesregardless of this criminals terrorists and extremists will try and manage to take control of the digital magic wand sooner or later—perhaps even without us noticing almost all companies and institutions have already been hacked even the pentagon the white house and the nsaa further problem arises when adequate transparency and democratic control are lacking the erosion of the system from the inside search algorithms and recommendation systems can be influenced companies can bid on certain combinations of words to gain more favourable results governments are probably able to influence the outcomes too during elections they might nudge undecided voters towards supporting them—a manipulation that would be hard to detect therefore whoever controls this technology can win elections—by nudging themselves to powerthis problem is exacerbated by the fact that in many countries a single search engine or social media platform has a predominant market share it could decisively influence the public and interfere with these countries remotely even though the european court of justice judgment made on 6th october 2015 limits the unrestrained export of european data the underlying problem still has not been solved within europe and even less so elsewherewhat undesirable side effects can we expect in order for manipulation to stay unnoticed it takes a socalled resonance effect—suggestions that are sufficiently customized to each individual in this way local trends are gradually reinforced by repetition leading all the way to the filter bubble or echo chamber effect in the end all you might get is your own opinions reflected back at you this causes social polarization resulting in the formation of separate groups that no longer understand each other and find themselves increasingly at conflict with one another in this way personalized information can unintentionally destroy social cohesion this can be currently observed in american politics where democrats and republicans are increasingly drifting apart so that political compromises become almost impossible the result is a fragmentation possibly even a disintegration of societyowing to the resonance effect a largescale change of opinion in society can be only produced slowly and gradually the effects occur with a time lag but also they cannot be easily undone it is possible for example that resentment against minorities or migrants get out of control too much national sentiment can cause discrimination extremism and conflictperhaps even more significant is the fact that manipulative methods change the way we make our decisions they override the otherwise relevant cultural and social cues at least temporarily in summary the largescale use of manipulative methods could cause serious social damage including the brutalization of behavior in the digital world who should be held responsible for thislegal issuesthis raises legal issues that given the huge fines against tobacco companies banks it and automotive companies over the past few years should not be ignored but which laws if any might be violated first of all it is clear that manipulative technologies restrict the freedom of choice if the remote control of our behaviour worked perfectly we would essentially be digital slaves because we would only execute decisions that were actually made by others before of course manipulative technologies are only partly effective nevertheless our freedom is disappearing slowly but surely—in fact slowly enough that there has been little resistance from the population so farthe insights of the great enlightener immanuel kant seem to be highly relevant here among other things he noted that a state that attempts to determine the happiness of its citizens is a despot however the right of individual selfdevelopment can only be exercised by those who have control over their lives which presupposes informational selfdetermination this is about nothing less than our most important constitutional rights a democracy cannot work well unless those rights are respected if they are constrained this undermines our constitution our society and the stateas manipulative technologies such as big nudging function in a similar way to personalized advertising other laws are affected too advertisements must be marked as such and must not be misleading they are also not allowed to utilize certain psychological tricks such as subliminal stimuli this is why it is prohibited to show a soft drink in a film for a splitsecond because then the advertising is not consciously perceptible while it may still have a subconscious effect furthermore the current widespread collection and processing of personal data is certainly not compatible with the applicable data protection laws in european countries and elsewherefinally the legality of personalized pricing is questionable because it could be a misuse of insider information other relevant aspects are possible breaches of the principles of equality and nondiscrimination—and of competition laws as free market access and price transparency are no longer guaranteed the situation is comparable to businesses that sell their products cheaper in other countries but try to prevent purchases via these countries such cases have resulted in high punitive fines in the pastpersonalized advertising and pricing cannot be compared to classical advertising or discount coupons as the latter are nonspecific and also do not invade our privacy with the goal to take advantage of our psychological weaknesses and knock out our critical thinkingfurthermore let us not forget that in the academic world even harmless decision experiments are considered to be experiments with human subjects which would have to be approved by a publicly accountable ethics committee in each and every case the persons concerned are required to give their informed consent in contrast a single click to confirm that we agree with the contents of a hundredpage “terms of use” agreement which is the case these days for many information platforms is woefully inadequatenonetheless experiments with manipulative technologies such as nudging are performed with millions of people without informing them without transparency and without ethical constraints even large social networks like facebook or online dating platforms such as okcupid have already publicly admitted to undertaking these kinds of social experiments if we want to avoid irresponsible research on humans and society just think of the involvement of psychologists in the torture scandals of the recent past then we urgently need to impose high standards especially scientific quality criteria and a code of conduct similar to the hippocratic oathhas our thinking our freedom our democracy been hackedlet us suppose there was a superintelligent machine with godlike knowledge and superhuman abilities would we follow its instructions this seems possible but if we did that then the warnings expressed by elon musk bill gates steve wozniak stephen hawking and others would have become true computers would have taken control of the world we must be clear that a superintelligence could also make mistakes lie pursue selfish interests or be manipulated above all it could not be compared with the distributed collective intelligence of the entire populationthe idea of replacing the thinking of all citizens by a computer cluster would be absurd because that would dramatically lower the diversity and quality of the solutions achievable it is already clear that the problems of the world have not decreased despite the recent flood of data and the use of personalized information—on the contrary world peace is fragile the longterm change in the climate could lead to the greatest loss of species since the extinction of dinosaurs we are also far from having overcome the financial crisis and its impact on the economy cybercrime is estimated to cause an annual loss of 3 trillion dollars states and terrorists are preparing for cyberwarfarein a rapidly changing world a superintelligence can never make perfect decisions see fig 1 systemic complexity is increasing faster than data volumes which are growing faster than the ability to process them and data transfer rates are limited this results in disregarding local knowledge and facts which are important to reach good solutions distributed local control methods are often superior to centralized approaches especially in complex systems whose behaviors are highly variable hardly predictable and not capable of realtime optimization this is already true for traffic control in cities but even more so for the social and economic systems of our highly networked globalized worldfurthermore there is a danger that the manipulation of decisions by powerful algorithms undermines the basis of collective intelligence which can flexibly adapt to the challenges of our complex world for collective intelligence to work information searches and decisionmaking by individuals must occur independently if our judgments and decisions are predetermined by algorithms however this truly leads to a brainwashing of the people intelligent beings are downgraded to mere receivers of commands who automatically respond to stimuliin other words personalized information builds a filter bubble around us a kind of digital prison for our thinking how could creativity and thinking out of the box be possible under such conditions ultimately a centralized system of technocratic behavioral and social control using a superintelligent information system would result in a new form of dictatorship therefore the topdown controlled society which comes under the banner of liberal paternalism is in principle nothing else than a totalitarian regime with a rosy coverin fact big nudging aims to bring the actions of many people into line and to manipulate their perspectives and decisions this puts it in the arena of propaganda and the targeted incapacitation of the citizen by behavioral control we expect that the consequences would be fatal in the long term especially when considering the abovementioned effect of undermining culturea better digital society is possibledespite fierce global competition democracies would be wise not to cast the achievements of many centuries overboard in contrast to other political regimes western democracies have the advantage that they have already learned to deal with pluralism and diversity now they just have to learn how to capitalize on them morein the future those countries will lead that reach a healthy balance between business government and citizens this requires networked thinking and the establishment of an information innovation product and service ecosystem in order to work well it is not only important to create opportunities for participation but also to support diversity because there is no way to determine the best goal function should we optimize the gross national product per capita or sustainability power or peace happiness or life expectancy often enough what would have been better is only known after the fact by allowing the pursuit of various different goals a pluralistic society is better able to cope with the range of unexpected challenges to comecentralized topdown control is a solution of the past which is only suitable for systems of low complexity therefore federal systems and majority decisions are the solutions of the present with economic and cultural evolution social complexity will continue to rise therefore the solution for the future is collective intelligence this means that citizen science crowdsourcing and online discussion platforms are eminently important new approaches to making more knowledge ideas and resources availablecollective intelligence requires a high degree of diversity this is however being reduced by todays personalized information systems which reinforce trendssociodiversity is as important as biodiversity it fuels not only collective intelligence and innovation but also resilience—the ability of our society to cope with unexpected shocks reducing sociodiversity often also reduces the functionality and performance of an economy and society this is the reason why totalitarian regimes often end up in conflict with their neighbors typical longterm consequences are political instability and war as have occurred time and again throughout history pluralism and participation are therefore not to be seen primarily as concessions to citizens but as functional prerequisites for thriving complex modern societiesin summary it can be said that we are now at a crossroads see fig 2 big data artificial intelligence cybernetics and behavioral economics are shaping our society—for better or worse if such widespread technologies are not compatible with our societys core values sooner or later they will cause extensive damage they could lead to an automated society with totalitarian features in the worst case a centralized artificial intelligence would control what we know what we think and how we act we are at the historic moment where we have to decide on the right path—a path that allows us all to benefit from the digital revolution therefore we urge to adhere to the following fundamental principles1 to increasingly decentralize the function of information systems2 to support informational selfdetermination and participation3 to improve transparency in order to achieve greater trust4 to reduce the distortion and pollution of information5 to enable usercontrolled information filters6 to support social and economic diversity7 to improve interoperability and collaborative opportunities8 to create digital assistants and coordination tools9 to support collective intelligence and10 to promote responsible behavior of citizens in the digital world through digital literacy and enlightenmentfollowing this digital agenda we would all benefit from the fruits of the digital revolution the economy government and citizens alike what are we waiting fora strategy for the digital agebig data and artificial intelligence are undoubtedly important innovations they have an enormous potential to catalyze economic value and social progress from personalized healthcare to sustainable cities it is totally unacceptable however to use these technologies to incapacitate the citizen big nudging and citizen scores abuse centrally collected personal data for behavioral control in ways that are totalitarian in nature this is not only incompatible with human rights and democratic principles but also inappropriate to manage modern innovative societies in order to solve the genuine problems of the world far better approaches in the fields of information and risk management are required the research area of responsible innovation and the initiative ”data for humanity” see big data for the benefit of society and humanity provide guidance as to how big data and artificial intelligence should be used for the benefit of societywhat can we do now first even in these times of digital revolution the basic rights of citizens should be protected as they are a fundamental prerequisite of a modern functional democratic society this requires the creation of a new social contract based on trust and cooperation which sees citizens and customers not as obstacles or resources to be exploited but as partners for this the state would have to provide an appropriate regulatory framework which ensures that technologies are designed and used in ways that are compatible with democracy this would have to guarantee informational selfdetermination not only theoretically but also practically because it is a precondition for us to lead our lives in a selfdetermined and responsible mannerthere should also be a right to get a copy of personal data collected about us it should be regulated by law that this information must be automatically sent in a standardized format to a personal data store through which individuals could manage the use of their data potentially supported by particular aibased digital assistants to ensure greater privacy and to prevent discrimination the unauthorised use of data would have to be punishable by law individuals would then be able to decide who can use their information for what purpose and for how long furthermore appropriate measures should be taken to ensure that data is securely stored and exchangedsophisticated reputation systems considering multiple criteria could help to increase the quality of information on which our decisions are based if data filters and recommendation and search algorithms would be selectable and configurable by the user we could look at problems from multiple perspectives and we would be less prone to manipulation by distorted informationin addition we need an efficient complaints procedure for citizens as well as effective sanctions for violations of the rules finally in order to create sufficient transparency and trust leading scientific institutions should act as trustees of the data and algorithms that currently evade democratic control this would also require an appropriate code of conduct that at the very least would have to be followed by anyone with access to sensitive data and algorithms—a kind of hippocratic oath for it professionalsfurthermore we would require a digital agenda to lay the foundation for new jobs and the future of the digital society every year we invest billions in the agricultural sector and public infrastructure schools and universities—to the benefit of industry and the service sectorwhich public systems do we therefore need to ensure that the digital society becomes a success first completely new educational concepts are needed this should be more focused on critical thinking creativity inventiveness and entrepreneurship than on creating standardised workers whose tasks in the future will be done by robots and computer algorithms education should also provide an understanding of the responsible and critical use of digital technologies because citizens must be aware of how the digital world is intertwined with the physical one in order to effectively and responsibly exercise their rights citizens must have an understanding of these technologies but also of what uses are illegitimate this is why there is all the more need for science industry politics and educational institutions to make this knowledge widely availablesecondly a participatory platform is needed that makes it easier for people to become selfemployed set up their own projects find collaboration partners market products and services worldwide manage resources and pay tax and social security contributions a kind of sharing economy for all to complement this towns and even villages could set up centers for the emerging digital communities such as fab labs where ideas can be jointly developed and tested for free thanks to the open and innovative approach found in these centers massive collaborative innovation could be promotedparticular kinds of competitions could provide additional incentives for innovation help increase public visibility and generate momentum for a participatory digital society they could be particularly useful in mobilising civil society to ensure local contributions to global problems solving for example by means of climate olympics for instance platforms aiming to coordinate scarce resources could help unleash the huge potential of the circular and sharing economy which is still largely untappedwith the commitment to an open data strategy governments and industry would increasingly make data available for science and public use to create suitable conditions for an efficient information and innovation ecosystem that keeps pace with the challenges of our world this could be encouraged by tax cuts in the same way as they were granted in some countries for the use of environmentally friendly technologiesthirdly building a digital nervous system run by the citizens could open up new opportunities of the internet of things for everyone and provide realtime data measurements available to all if we want to use resources in a more sustainable way and slow down climate change we need to measure the positive and negative side effects of our interactions with others and our environment by using appropriate feedback loops systems could be influenced in such a way that they achieve the desired outcomes by means of selforganizationfor this to succeed we would need various incentive and exchange systems available to all economic political and social innovators this could create entirely new markets and therefore also the basis for new prosperity unleashing the virtually unlimited potential of the digital economy would be greatly promoted by a pluralistic financial system for example functionally differentiated currencies and new regulations for the compensation for inventionsto better cope with the complexity and diversity of our future world and to turn it into an advantage we will require personal digital assistants these digital assistants will also benefit from developments in the field of artificial intelligence in the future it can be expected that numerous networks combining human and artificial intelligence will be flexibly built and reconfigured as needed however in order for us to retain control of our lives these networks should be controlled in a distributed way in particular one would also have to be able to log in and log out as desireddemocratic platformsa wikipedia of cultures could eventually help to coordinate various activities in a highly diverse world and to make them compatible with each other it would make the mostly implicit success principles of the worlds cultures explicit so that they could be combined in new ways a cultural genome project like this would also be a kind of peace project because it would raise public awareness for the value of sociocultural diversity global companies have long known that culturally diverse and multidisciplinary teams are more successful than homogeneous ones however the framework needed to efficiently collate knowledge and ideas from lots of people in order to create collective intelligence is still missing in many places to change this the provision of online deliberation platforms would be highly useful they could also create the framework needed to realize an upgraded digital democracy with greater participatory opportunities for citizens this is important because many of the problems facing the world today can only be managed with contributions from civil societyfurther

now take better evidencebased decisions however the principle of topdown control increasingly fails since the complexity of society grows in an explosive way as we go on networking our world distributed control approaches will become ever more important only by means of collective intelligence will it be possible to find appropriate solutions to the complexity challenges of our worldour society is at a crossroads if ever more powerful algorithms would be controlled by a few decisionmakers and reduce our selfdetermination we would fall back in a feudalism 20 as important historical achievements would be lost now however we have the chance to choose the path to digital democracy or democracy 20 which would benefit us all see also httpsvimeocom147442522spotlight on china is this what the future of society looks likehow would behavioural and social control impact our lives the concept of a citizen score which is now being implemented in china gives an idea there all citizens are rated on a onedimensional ranking scale everything they do gives plus or minus points this is not only aimed at mass surveillance the score depends on an individuals clicks on the internet and their politicallycorrect conduct or not and it determines their credit terms their access to certain jobs and travel visas therefore the citizen score is about behavioural and social control even the behaviour of friends and acquaintances affects this score ie the principle of clan liability is also applied everyone becomes both a guardian of virtue and a kind of snooping informant at the same time unorthodox thinkers are isolated were similar principles to spread in democratic countries it would be ultimately irrelevant whether it was the state or influential companies that set the rules in both cases the pillars of democracy would be directly threatenedsuch a control of society would turn away from selfresponsible citizens to individuals as underlings leading to a feudalism 20 this is diametrically opposed to democratic values it is therefore time for an enlightenment 20 which would feed into a democracy 20 based on digital selfdetermination this requires democratic technologies information systems which are compatible with democratic principles otherwise they will destroy our societyhe who has large amounts of data can manipulate people in subtle ways but even benevolent decisionmakers may do more wrong than right says dirk helbingproponents of nudging argue that people do not take optimal decisions and it is therefore necessary to help them this school of thinking is known as paternalism however nudging does not choose the way of informing and persuading people it rather exploits psychological weaknesses in order to bring us to certain behaviours ie we are tricked the scientific approach underlying this approach is called behaviorism which is actually long out of datedecades ago burrhus frederic skinner conditioned rats pigeons and dogs by rewards and punishments for example by feeding them or applying painful electric shocks today one tries to condition people in similar ways instead of in a skinner box we are living in a filter bubble with personalized information our thinking is being steered with personalized prices we may be even punished or rewarded for example for undesired clicks on the internet the combination of nudging with big data has therefore led to a new form of nudging that we may call big nudging the increasing amount of personal information about us which is often collected without our consent reveals what we think how we feel and how we can be manipulated this insider information is exploited to manipulate us to make choices that we would otherwise not make to buy some overpriced products or those that we do not need or perhaps to give our vote to a certain political partyhowever big nudging is not suitable to solve many of our problems this is particularly true for the complexityrelated challenges of our world although already 90 countries use nudging it has not reduced our societal problems on the contrary global warming is progressing world peace is fragile and terrorism is on the rise cybercrime explodes and also the economic and debt crisis is not solved in many countriesthere is also no solution to the inefficiency of financial markets as nudging guru richard thaler recently admitted in his view if the state would control financial markets this would rather aggravate the problem but why should one then control our society in a topdown way which is even more complex than a financial market society is not a machine and complex systems cannot be steered like a car this can be understood by discussing another complex system our bodies to cure diseases one needs to take the right medicine at the right time in the right dose many treatments also have serious side and interaction effects the same of course is expected to apply to social interventions by big nudging often is not clear in advance what would be good or bad for society 60 percent of the scientific results in psychology are not reproducible therefore chances are to cause more harm than good by big nudgingfurthermore there is no measure which is good for all people for example in recent decades we have seen food advisories changing all the time many people also suffer from food intolerances which can even be fatal mass screenings for certain kinds of cancer and other diseases are now being viewed quite critically because the side effects of wrong diagnoses often outweigh the benefits therefore if one decided to use big nudging a solid scientific basis transparency ethical evaluation and democratic control would be really crucial the measures taken would have to guarantee statistically significant improvements and the side effects would have to be acceptable users should be made aware of them in analogy to a medical leaflet and the treated persons would have to have the last wordin addition applying one and the same measure to the entire population would not be good but far too little is known to take appropriate individual measures not only is it important for society to apply different treatments in order to maintain diversity but correlations regarding what measure to take in what particular context matter as well for the functioning of society it is essential that people apply different roles which are fitting to the respective situation they are in big nudging is far from being able to deliver thiscurrent bigdatabased personalization rather creates new problems such as discrimination for instance if we make health insurance rates dependent on certain diets then jews muslims and christians women and men will have to pay different rates thus a bunch of new problems is arisingrichard thaler is therefore not getting tired to emphasize that nudging should only be used in beneficial ways as a prime example how to use nudging he mentions a gpsbased route guidance system this however is turned on and off by the user the user also specifies the respective goal the digital assistant then offers several alternatives between which the user can freely choose after that the digital assistant supports the user as good as it can in reaching the goal and in making better decisions this would certainly be the right approach to improve peoples behaviours but today the spirit of big nudging is quite different from thisby ernst hafeneurope must guarantee citizens a right to a digital copy of all data about them right to a copy says ernst hafen a first step towards data democracy would be to establish cooperative banks for personal data that are owned by the citizens rather than by corporate shareholdersmedicine can profit from health data however access to personal data must be controlled the persons the data subjects themselves the “right to a copy” forms the basis for such a controlin europe we like to point out that we live in free democratic societies we have almost unconsciously become dependent on multinational data firms however whose free services we pay for with our own data personal data—which is now sometimes referred to as a “new asset class” or the oil of the 21st century—is greatly sought after however thus far nobody has managed to extract the maximum use from personal data because it lies in many different data sets google and facebook may know more about our health than our doctor but even these firms cannot collate all of our data because they rightly do not have access to our patient files shopping receipts or information about our genomic makeup in contrast to other assets data can be copied with almost no associated cost every person should have the right to obtain a copy of all their personal data in this way they can control the use and aggregation of their data and decide themselves whether to give access to friends another doctor or the scientific communitythe emergence of mobile health sensors and apps means that patients can contribute significant medical insights by recording their bodily health on their smartphones such as medical indicators and the side effects of medications they supply important data which make it possible to observe how treatments are applied evaluate health technologies and conduct evidencebased medicine in general it is also a moral obligation to give citizens access to copies of their data and allow them to take part in medical research because it will save lives and make health care more affordableeuropean countries should copperfasten the digital selfdetermination of their citizens by enshrining the “right to a copy” in their constitutions as has been proposed in switzerland in this way citizens can use their data to play an active role in the global data economy if they can store copies of their data in nonprofit citizencontrolled cooperative institutions a large portion of the economic value of personal data could be returned to society the cooperative institutions would act as trustees in managing the data of their members this would result in the democratization of the market for personal data and the end of digital dependencecitizens must be allowed to actively participatein order to deal with future technology in a responsible way it is necessary that each one of us can participate in the decisionmaking process argues bruno s frey from the university of baselhow can responsible innovation be promoted effectively appeals to the public have little if any effect if the institutions or rules shaping human interactions are not designed to incentivize and enable people to meet these requestsseveral types of institutions should be considered most importantly society must be decentralized following the principle of subsidiarity three dimensions matterthese types of decentralization will continue to be of major importance in the digital society of the futurein addition citizens must have the opportunity to directly participate in decisionmaking on particular issues by means of popular referenda in the discourse prior to such a referendum all relevant arguments should be brought forward and stated in an organized fashion the various proposals about how to solve a particular problem should be compared and narrowed down to those which seem to be most promising and integrated insomuch as possible during a mediation process finally a referendum needs to take place which serves to identify the most viable solution for the local conditions viable in the sense that it enjoys a diverse range of support in the electoratenowadays online deliberation tools can efficiently support such processes this makes it possible to consider a larger and more diverse range of ideas and knowledge harnessing “collective intelligence” to produce better policy proposalsanother way to implement the ten proposals would be to create new unorthodox institutions for example it could be made compulsory for every official body to take on an “advocatus diaboli” this lateral thinker would be tasked with developing counterarguments and alternatives to each proposal this would reduce the tendency to think along the lines of “political correctness” and unconventional approaches to the problem would also be consideredanother unorthodox measure would be to choose among the alternatives considered reasonable during the discourse process using random decisionmaking mechanisms such an approach increases the chance that unconventional and generally disregarded proposals and ideas would be integrated into the digital society of the futurebruno s freybruno frey 1941 is an academic economist and permanent visiting professor at the university of basel where he directs the center for research in economics and wellbeing crew he is also research director of the center for research in economics management and the arts crema in zurichwhen technology determines how we see the world there is a threat of misuse and deception thus innovation must reflect our values argues jeroen van den hovengermany was recently rocked by an industrial scandal of global proportions the revelations led to the resignation of the ceo of one of the largest car manufacturers a grave loss of consumer confidence a dramatic slump in share price and economic damage for the entire car industry there was even talk of severe damage to the “made in germany” brand the compensation payments will be in the range of billions of eurothe background to the scandal was a situation whereby vw and other car manufacturers used manipulative software which could detect the conditions under which the environmental compliance of a vehicle was tested the software algorithm altered the behavior of the engine so that it emitted fewer pollutant exhaust fumes under test conditions than in normal circumstances in this way it cheated the test procedure the full reduction of emissions occurred only during the tests but not in normal usein the 21st century we urgently need to address the question of how we can implement ethical standards technologicallysimilarly algorithms computer code software models and data will increasingly determine what we see in the digital society and what are choices are with regard to health insurance finance and politics this brings new risks for the economy and society in particular there is a danger of deceptionthus it is important to understand that our values are embodied in the things we create otherwise the technological design of the future will determine the shape of our society “code is law” if these values are selfserving discriminatory or contrary to the ideals of freedom and personal privacy this will damage our society thus in the 21st century we must urgently address the question of how we can implement ethical standards technologically the challenge calls for us to “design for value”if we lack the motivation to develop the technological tools science and institutions necessary to align the digital world with our shared values the future looks very bleak thankfully the european union has invested in an extensive research and development program for responsible innovation furthermore the eu countries which passed the lund and rome declarations emphasized that innovation needs to be carried out responsibly among other things this means that innovation should be directed at developing intelligent solutions to societal problems which can harmonize values such as efficiency security and sustainability genuine innovation does not involve deceiving people into believing that their cars are sustainable and efficient genuine innovation means creating technologies that can actually satisfy these requirementstechnology needs users who can control itrather than letting intelligent technology diminish our brainpower we should learn to better control it says gerd gigerenzer—beginning in childhoodthe digital revolution provides an impressive array of possibilities thousands of apps the internet of things and almost permanent connectivity to the world but in the excitement one thing is easily forgotten innovative technology needs competent users who can control it rather than be controlled by itthree examplesone of my doctoral students sits at his computer and appears to be engrossed in writing his dissertation at the same time his email inbox is open all day long he is in fact waiting to be interrupted its easy to recognize how many interruptions he had in the course of the day by looking at the flow of his writingan american student writes text messages while drivingwhen a text comes in i just have to look no matter what fortunately my phone shows me the text as a pop up at first… so i dont have to do too much looking while im driving if at the speed of 50 miles per hour she takes only 2 seconds to glance at her cell phone shes just driven 48 yards blind that young woman is risking a car accident her smart phone has taken control of her behavior—as is the case for the 20 to 30 percent of germans who also text while drivingduring the parliamentary elections in india in 2014 the largest democratic election in the world with over 800 million potential voters there were three main candidates n modi a kejriwal and r ghandi in a study undecided voters could find out more information about these candidates using an internet search engine however the participants did not know that the web pages had been manipulated for one group more positive items about modi popped up on the first page and negative ones later on the other groups experienced the same for the other candidates this and similar manipulative procedures are common practice on the internet it is estimated that for candidates who appear on the first page thanks to such manipulation the number of votes they receive from undecided voters increases by 20 percentage pointsin each of these cases human behavior is controlled by digital technology losing control is nothing new but the digital revolution has increased the possibility of that happeningwhat can we do there are three competing visions one is technopaternalism which replaces flawed human judgment with algorithms the distracted doctoral student could continue readings his emails and use thesiswriting software all he would need to do is input key information on the topic such algorithms would solve the annoying problem of plagiarism scandals by making them an everyday occurrencealthough still in the domain of science fiction human judgment is already being replaced by computer programs in many areas the babyconnect app for instance tracks the daily development of infants—height weight number of times it was nursed how often its diapers were changed and much more—while newer apps compare the baby with other users children in a realtime database for parents their baby becomes a data vector and normal discrepancies often cause unnecessary concernthe second vision is known as nudging rather than letting the algorithm do all the work people are steered into a particular direction often without being aware of it the experiment on the elections in india is an example of that we know that the first page of google search results receives about 90 of all clicks and half of these are the first two results this knowledge about human behavior is taken advantage of by manipulating the order of results so that the positive ones about a particular candidate or a particular commercial product appear on the first page in countries such as germany where web searches are dominated by one search engine google this leads to endless possibilities to sway voters like technopaternalism nudging takes over the helmbut there is a third possibility my vision is risk literacy where people are equipped with the competencies to control media rather than be controlled by it in general risk literacy concerns informed ways of dealing with riskrelated areas such as health money and modern technologies digital risk literacy means being able to take advantage of digital technologies without becoming dependent on or manipulated by them that is not as hard as it sounds my doctoral student has since learned to switch on his email account only three times a day morning noon and evening so that he can work on his dissertation without constant interruptionlearning digital selfcontrol needs to begin as a child at school and also from the example set by parents some paternalists may scoff at the idea stating that humans lack the intelligence and selfdiscipline to ever become risk literate but centuries ago the same was said about learning to read and write—which a majority of people in industrial countries can now do in the same way people can learn to deal with risks more sensibly to achieve this we need to radically rethink strategies and invest in people rather than replace or manipulate them with intelligent technologies in the 21st century we need less paternalism and nudging and more informed critical and risksavvy citizens its time to snatch away the remote control from technology and take our lives into our own handsthe power of data can be used for good and bad purposes roberto zicari and andrej zwitter have formulated five principles of big data ethicsby andrej zwitter and roberto zicariin recent times there have been a growing number of voices — from tech visionaries like elon musk tesla motors to bill gates microsoft and steve wozniak apple — warning of the dangers of artificial intelligence ai a petition against automated weapon systems was signed by 200000 people and an open letter recently published by mit calls for a new inclusive approach to the coming digital societywe must realize that big data like any other tool can be used for good and bad purposes in this sense the decision by the european court of justice against the safe harbour agreement on human rights grounds is understandablestates international organizations and private actors now employ big data in a variety of spheres it is important that all those who profit from big data are aware of their moral responsibility for this reason the data for humanity initiative was established with the goal of disseminating an ethical code of conduct for big data use this initiative advances five fundamental ethical principles for big data users1 “do no harm” the digital footprint that everyone now leaves behind exposes individuals social groups and society as a whole to a certain degree of transparency and vulnerability those who have access to the insights afforded by big data must not harm third parties2 ensure that data is used in such a way that the results will foster the peaceful coexistence of humanity the selection of content and access to data influences the world view of a society peaceful coexistence is only possible if data scientists are aware of their responsibility to provide even and unbiased access to data3 use data to help people in need in addition to being economically beneficial innovation in the sphere of big data could also create additional social value in the age of global connectivity it is now possible to create innovative big data tools which could help to support people in need4 use data to protect nature and reduce pollution of the environment one of the biggest achievements of big data analysis is the development of efficient processes and synergy effects big data can only offer a sustainable economic and social future if such methods are also used to create and maintain a healthy and stable natural environment5 use data to eliminate discrimination and intolerance and to create a fair system of social coexistence social media has created a strengthened social network this can only lead to longterm global stability if it is built on the principles of fairness equality and justiceto conclude we would also like to draw attention to how interesting new possibilities afforded by big data could lead to a better future as more data become less costly and technology breaks barriers to acquisition and analysis the opportunity to deliver actionable information for civic purposes grows this might be termed the common good challenge for big data jake porway datakind in the end it is important to understand the turn to big data as an opportunity to do good and as a hope for a better futurein the digital age machines steer everyday life to a considerable extent already we should therefore think twice before we share our personal data says expert yvonne hofstetterif norbert wiener 18941964 had experienced the digital era for him it would have been the land of plenty “cybernetics is the science of information and control regardless of whether the target of control is a machine or a living organism” the founder of cybernetics once explained in hannover germany in 1960 in history the world never produced such amount of data and information as it does todaycybernetics a science asserting ubiquitous importance makes a strong claim “everything can be controlled” during the 20th century both the us armed forces and the soviet union applied cybernetics to control their arms’ race the nato had deployed socalled c3i systems command control communication and information a term for military infrastructure that leans linguistically to wiener’s book on cybernetics or control and communication in the animal and the machine published in 1948 control refers to the control of machines as well as of individuals or entire social systems like military alliances financial markets or pointing to the 21st century even the electorate its major premise keeping the world under surveillance to collect data connecting people and things to the internet of everything is a perfect to way to obtain the required mass data as input to cybernetic control strategieswith cybernetics wiener proposed a new scientific concept the closedloop feedback feedback—eg the likes we give the online comments we make—is a major concept of digitization too does that mean digitization is the most perfect implementation of cybernetics when we use smart devices we are creating a ceaseless data stream disclosing our intentions geo position or social environment while we communicate more thoughtlessly than ever online in the background an ecosystem of artificial intelligence is evolving today artificial intelligence is the sole technology being able to profile us and draw conclusions about our future behavioran automated control strategy usually a learning machine analyzes our actual situation and then computes a stimulus that should draw us closer to a more desirable “optimal” state increasingly such controllers govern our daily lives as digital assistants they help us making decisions in the vast ocean of optionality and intimidating uncertainty even google search is a control strategy when typing a keyword a user reveals his intentions the google search engine in turn will not just present a list with best hits but a link list that embodies the highest financial value rather for the company than for the user doing it that way ie listing corporate offerings at the very top of the search results google controls the user’s next clicks this the european union argues is a misusebut is there any way out yes if we disconnected from the cybernetic loop just stop responding to a digital stimulus cybernetics will fail if the controllable counterpart steps out of the loop yet we are free to owe a response to a digital controller however as digitization further escalates soon we may have no more choice hence we are called on to fight for our freedom rights—afresh during the digital era and in particular at the rise of intelligent machinesfor norbert wiener 18941964 the digital era would be a paradise “cybernetics is the science of information and control regardless of whether a machine or a living organism is being controlled” the founder of cybernetics once said in hanover germany in 1960cybernetics a science which claims ubiquitous importance makes a strong promise “everything is controllable” during the 20th century both the us armed forces and the soviet union applied cybernetics to control the arms’ race nato had deployed socalled c3i systems command control communication

communicating connecting people and things to the internet of everything is a perfect way to obtain the required data as input of cybernetic control strategieswith cybernetics a new scientific concept was proposed the closedloop feedback feedback—such as the likes we give or the online comments we make—is another major concept related to digitization does this mean that digitization is the most

could even lead to punishment for violations that have not happened but are merely expected to occur as the underlying algorithms cannot operate completely free of error the principle of fairness and

terms to consumers and anything artificial has become anathema to many unless we’re talking artificial intelligence – or ai – then investors should be hungry to learn as much as possible about a technology that is becoming as ubiquitous as organic tofuthe vast majority of nearly 2000 experts polled by the pew research center in 2014 said they anticipate robotics and artificial intelligence will permeate wide segments of daily life by 2025 a 2015 study covering 17 countries found that artificial intelligence and related technologies added an estimated 04 percentage point on average to those countries’ annual gdp growth between 1993 and 2007 accounting for just over onetenth of those countries’ overall gdp growth during that timeinteresting numbers – but just what is artificial intelligence and are robots with ai going to enslave humanitywe can’t answer the second question but here’s a good working artificial intelligence definition from a recent us government report called “preparing for the future of artificial intelligence”“artificial intelligence is a computerized system that exhibits behavior that is commonly thought of as requiring intelligence”or more technically speaking ai is a “system capable of rationally solving complex problems or taking appropriate actions to achieve its goals in whatever real world circumstances it encounters” in a way artificial intelligence is about understanding – then recreating – the human mind and ai is not just about designing computers that mimic how we think learn and process information but also how we perceive and feel about the world around usunderstanding the world of ai only begins with a simple artificial intelligence definition there’s a whole universe of terminology we need to explore in order to understand the domain before we can invest in itsource artificial intelligence for dummiesmachine learning is about how computers with artificial intelligence can improve over time using different algorithms a set of rules or processes as it is fed more data ai machines learn by recognizing trends in data that allow it to make decisions for example designing autonomous vehicles involves building machines that learn to navigate a system may use pattern recognition algorithms from which it learns for instance to identify pedestrians from vehicles from animals so that it knows when to hit the brakes when it sees a cat or a zebra even if it never encountered the latter because it has learned to identify animals accurately regular readers will recall a previous article we wrote on this topic tiled “deep learning and machine learning simply explained” which gives an example of how this works in practicea type of machine learning neural networks are superficially based on how the brain works there are different kinds of neural networks – feedforward and recurrent are a couple terms that you may encounter – but basically they consist of a set of nodes or neurons arranged in multiple layers with weighted interconnections between them each neuron combines a set of input values to produce an output value which in turn is passed on to other neurons downstream as seen in the example belowfrom an example from the us government report in an image recognition application a first layer of units might combine the raw data of the image to recognize simple patterns in the image a second layer of units might combine the results of the first layer to recognize patternsofpatterns a third layer might combine the results of the second layer and so on we train neural networks by feeding them lots of delicious big data to learn fromdeep learning is simply a larger neural network deep learning networks typically use many layers – sometimes more than 100 – and often use a large number of units at each layer to enable the recognition of extremely complex precise patterns in data the below diagram shows how deep learning fits into the bigger picturesome successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition also referred to as natural language processingcomputer vision might sound like the latest 3d eyewear but it’s actually a field of research for designing machines with the ability to process understand and use visual data just as humans do the eyes in this case usually consist of a camera autonomous vehicles are one obvious example another one that may be sitting in your living room with a teenager right now is a device called kinect for xbox kinect uses a sophisticated system for motioncapture that allows a user to interact with the computer without the use of a controllernatural language processing as defined by aitopicsorg “enables communication between people and computers and automatic translation to enable people to interact easily with others around the world” those who belong to the apple cult are familiar with one version of this artificial intelligence – siri output and input can be verbal or written other terms that fall into this category include natural language understanding and natural language generationfor some it’s not enough to imbue computers with artificial intelligence an emerging field called affective computing works to give our electronics emotional intelligence whether to understand a human user or to influence one emotionally the best way to learn more about this exciting application of artificial intelligence is to read our article on “affective computing and ai emotion recognition” which talks about an interesting startup in this space called affectivamany neural networks for artificial intelligence are powered by what’s called graphics processing units gpus pioneered in 2007 by a company called nvidia gpus basically help computers work much faster than those operating with a central processing unit cpu alone some companies have built their own versions of gpus for example google being google the technology giant has a chip it calls the tensor processing unit or tpu that supports the software engine tensorflow that drives its deep learning services according to wired magazine there are also a handful of startups working on building ai chipscognitive computing is one of those terms that has fairly recently entered the ai lexicon one of the definitions for cognitive computing – a term that some attribute to ibm with the birth of watson the computer jeopardy champ – that seems to be prolific around the interwebs sums it up thus “cognitive computing involves selflearning systems that use data mining ie big data pattern recognition ie machine learning and natural language processing to mimic the way the human brain works” katherine noyes writes in computerworld that cognitive computing “deals with symbolic and conceptual information rather than just pure data or sensor streams with the aim of making highlevel decisions in complex situations”that all sounds a lot like artificial intelligence eh in a blog by technology market analysis company vdc research the difference between artificial intelligence and cognitive computing boils down to the idea that the former tells the user what course of action to take based on its analysis while the latter provides information to help the user to decide or perhaps as noyes implies in her conclusion cognitive computing might just be clever repackaging of artificial intelligence after all

will have to adapt to the world of smart machines the fact is artificial intelligence will soon be able to do the administrative tasks that consume much of managers’ time faster better and at a lower costhow can managers — from the front lines to the csuite — thrive in the age of ai to find out we surveyed 1770 managers from 14 countries and interviewed 37 executives in charge of digital transformation at their organizations using this data we identified five practices that successful managers will need to masteraccording to the survey managers across all levels spend more than half of their time on administrative coordination and control tasks for instance a typical store manager or a lead nurse at a nursing home must constantly juggle shift schedules because of staff members’ illnesses vacations or sudden departures these are the very responsibilities that the same managers expect to see ai affecting the most and they are correct ai will automate many of these tasksreport writing is another relevant example the associated press expanded its quarterly earnings reporting from approximately 300 stories to 4400 with the help of aipowered software robots in doing so technology freed up journalists to conduct more investigative and interpretive reporting imagine technology like this drafting your next management report in fact this is already possible for some analytical management reports recently the data analytics company tableau announced a partnership with narrative science a chicagobased provider of natural language generation tools the result of the collaboration is narratives for tableau a free chrome extension that automatically creates written explanations for tableau graphicsthe managers we surveyed see such change in a positive light eightysix percent said they would like ai support with monitoring and reportingmany decisions require insight beyond what artificial intelligence can squeeze from data alone managers use their knowledge of organizational history and culture as well as empathy and ethical reflection this is the essence of human judgment — the application of experience and expertise to critical business decisions and practices managers we surveyed have a sense of a shift in this direction and identify the judgmentoriented skills of creative thinking and experimentation data analysis and interpretation and strategy development as three of the four top new skills that will be required to succeed in the futureas layne thompson director of erp services for a us navy it organization told us “more often than not managers think of what they’re doing as requiring judgment discretion experience and the capacity to improvise as opposed to simply applying rules and if one of the potential promises of machine learning is the ability to help make decisions then we should think of technology as being intended to support rather than replace managers”managers who view ai as a kind of colleague will recognize that there’s no need to “race against a machine” while human judgment is unlikely to be automated intelligent machines can add enormously to this type of work assisting in decision support and datadriven simulations as well as search and discovery activities in fact 78 of the surveyed managers believe that they will trust the advice of intelligent systems in making business decisions in the futureone company that is trying to address these opportunities is kensho technologies a provider of nextgeneration investment analytics its system allows investment managers to ask investmentrelated questions in plain english such as “what sectors and industries perform best three months before and after a rate hike” and get answers within minutes picture how such technologies could support individuals and teams of managers in assessing decision consequences and exploring scenariosnot only will ai augment managers’ work but it will also enable managers to interact with intelligent machines in collegial ways through conversation or other intuitive interfaces ai will be their alwaysavailable assistant and adviserwhile managers’ own creative abilities are vital perhaps even more important is their ability to harness others’ creativity managerdesigners bring together diverse ideas into integrated workable and appealing solutions they embed design thinking into the practices of their teams and organizations a third of the managers in our survey identified creative thinking and experimentation as a key skill area they need to learn to stay successful as ai increasingly takes over administrative workin an interview peter harmer ceo of insurance australia group emphasized the need for managers who foster collaborative creativity in the digital enterprise “we need people who can actually layer ideas on ideas not somebody who has to win in a competition around ideas but somebody who can say ‘crikey if we bring these two or three or four things together we’ve got something very very different’ that’s the creativity the curiosity we need in managers”the managers we surveyed recognized the value of judgment work but they undervalued the deep social skills critical to networking coaching and collaborating that will help them stand out in a world where ai carries out many of the administrative and analytical tasks they perform todaywhile they will use digital technologies to tap into the knowledge and judgment of partners customers and communities they must be able to tease out and bring together diverse perspectives insights and experiencesai will ultimately prove to be cheaper more efficient and potentially more impartial in its actions than human beings but such a scenario should not be cause for concern for managers it just means that their jobs will change to focus on things only humans can dowriting earnings reports is one thing but developing messages that can engage a workforce and provide a sense of purpose is human through and through tracking schedules and resources may soon fall within the jurisdiction of machines but drafting strategy remains unmistakably human simply put our recommendation is to adopt ai in order to automate administration and to augment but not replace human judgmentif the current shortage of analytical talent is any indication organizations can ill afford to wait and see whether their managers are equipped to work alongside ai to prepare themselves and their organizations for the kinds of humanled work that will gain prominence as technology takes on more routine tasks leaders must take the following stepsexplore early to navigate in an uncertain future managers must experiment with ai and apply their insights to the next cycle of experimentsadopt new key performance indicators to drive adoption ai will bring new criteria for success collaboration capabilities information sharing experimentation learning and decisionmaking effectiveness and the ability to reach beyond the organization for insightsdevelop training and recruitment strategies for creativity collaboration empathy and judgment skills leaders should develop a diverse workforce and team of managers that balance experience with creative and social intelligence — each side complementing the other to support sound collective judgmentwhile oncoming disruptions won’t arrive all at once the pace of development is faster and the implications more farreaching than most executives and managers realize those managers capable of assessing what the workforce of the

breakthrough technologies catching fire on campus these days one of them crisprcas9 is changing our relationship to the physical world through gene editing the other artificial intelligence ai is changing how we generate process and analyze informationai already touches many of our daily computing activities from searching the web to managing spam in email applications it underlies the speech recognition that makes apple’s siri microsoft’s cortana amazon’s alexa and the google assistant able to process and respond — with some success — to our queries1 it is the computer vision that helps selfdriving cars and food delivery robots navigate our streets and sidewalks the fundamental activity driving these varied applications of ai is search within a large space of possibilities it is not deep cognition but perceptual recognition the power lies in the fact that machines can recognize patterns efficiently and routinely at a scale and speed that humans cannot approachthough the underlying ai technologies that make all these applications possible have existed since the 1970s and 80s ai has really taken off in the last decade applied to search within images sound and text2 natural language processing nlp in linguistics is a system for understanding language that has opened entirely new avenues of research across the university making it possible to mine large corpora identify topics recognize named entities people places and things and perform sentiment analysis computer vision is an interdisciplinary branch of ai that incorporates knowledge from several domains including physics signal processing and neurobiology to understand images and video machine learning dramatically accelerates statistical pattern recognition by learning from examples research to predict crop yield from remote sensing data diagnose heart arrhythmias and read 2000yearold papyri carbonized by the eruption of vesuvius use machine learning in combination with other ai technologies 3the term machine learning suggests that the machine is teaching itself but the most common learning techniques are supervised requiring a tremendous amount of human work and the careful curation of training data4 the combination of massive amounts of data accelerated computing power and a deeper understanding of how we learn have created the conditions for successful applications of multilayered machine learning known as deep learning that uses artificial neural network architectures inspired by the way neurons function within the brain neural networks can learn features over time and begin to characterize them this approach has made unsupervised learning possible a great deal of data is needed but it need not be humancultivated training sets in the cat example popularized by andrew ng’s team instead of feeding the machine millions of images of cats so that it can recognize the features common to a cat unsupervised learning works by letting the machine create its own classifications of an essentially infinite number of images then when presented with a picture that we have labeled ‘cat’ it matches that image to its own classification system and returns images that match our labelled image5earlier this year at the stanford business school andrew ng declared ai ‘the new electricity’ with the potential to transform nearly every industry deeply influencing how we live and work at stanford libraries we are considering the profound change ai can bring as power tools for scholarship making our vast library collections discoverable searchable and analyzable in new ways thinking about the transformation ai could bring to libraries is by no means new but the conditions are ripe for us to revisit and rethink ed feigenbaum’s vision of the library of the future6 how best do we bring the skills and knowledge of library staff scholars and students together to design an intelligent information system that respects the sources engages critical inquiry fosters imagination and supports human learning and knowledge creationwebcomic from abstruse goose via peter norvig1 recent research at stanford found speech interfaces three times faster than typing on mobile devices and work in this area has increased rapidly2 in a great tedx boston talk from october 2016 titled “when machines have ideas” ben vigoda talks about how he was at stanford writing machine learning algorithms using artificial neural networks trained with the backpropagation algorithm 29 years ago3 the study on crop yields was led by stefano ermon at stanford the work on detecting heart arrhythmias was done by andrew ng’s students at stanford and the work on reading papyri was led by brent seales at the university of kentucky4 success can require millions of images and this only became possible because of projects like imagenet 2009 that collected 15 million images in 22000 categories5 building highlevel features using large scale unsupervised learning 20126 find “toward the

'artificial intelligence will change the world because so many people and companies believe this ai and the entire technological ecosystem in which it functions are highly valuable to privatesector organizations and nationstates that means that nations will try to identify steal and corrupt or otherwise counteract the ai and related assets of others and will use ai against each other in pursuit of their own national interests and that presents the united states and its allies with a classic counterintelligence problem in a novel and highstakes context how do we protect a valuable national asset against a range of threats from hostile foreign actors and how do we protect ourselves against the threat from ai in the hands of adversariesin the broad and diverse discussion of artificial intelligence in the global technological and economic infrastructure of the future this question has received remarkably little attentionin this post and others to follow i will endeavor to explore some of the counterintelligence risks and problems presented by ai and the ai ecosystem i’ll first talk about the general problem of ai and counterintelligence and then in later posts dive into some of the specific areas that cause me the greatest concern in this spheretechnological advancements often change society with ai however the nature scope and speed of the change are different from what we are used to ai will impact society broadly and deeply and it is all going to happen very quickly as a result it will be increasingly hard to think clearly about the risks and opportunities that ai presents calculating risks by thinking about threats vulnerabilities probabilities and the impact or costs of bad outcomes is more challenging with ai because it is so different these sorts of calculations normally take time they also require at least an intuitive understanding of the risks of bad outcomes—and the probabilities associated with those risks and they require decisionmakers who are savvy about these risks and have good instincts about technology that is changing fast none of these factors are sufficiently present right nowa few key conceptsai is already revolutionizing the world and will continue to do so at an increasing rate as the brookings institution’s john allen and darrell west have written recently ai will significantly impact the world’s economy and workforce the finance and healthcare systems national security criminal justice transportation and how cities operate all of this change is likely to redistribute and concentrate wealth challenge political systems and generate new cyber threats and defenses as paul scharre points out in his excellent recent book “army of none” ai also will fundamentally alter the way wars are fought it will change how nations conduct espionage against each other and what secrets they try to steal as others have pointed out the range of national security implications of ai is substantial everything from significantly enhanced intelligence analysis of large data sets to aifacilitated forgeries of audio and video media to swarms of armed flying drones autonomously attacking targets on the battlefieldbut what exactly is ai can the concept be defined clearly enough that people who are not computer scientists understand what is being talked about there are many ways to define and explain it—for example see here here here and here stuart russell and peter norvig have a useful framework for thinking about what ai is here for present purposes however let’s take the following as a useful working definition of ai in the counterintelligence context in which i will be addressing it as a lawyer who is not a technologist i approach this task cautiously because ai is complex and difficult to grasp fullyone of the most basic definitions of ai is “ai is a machine that can think” that highlevel definition however raises certain questions what makes up a machine what is thinking how do thinking machines act answering those requires more effort and a comprehensive analysis of all of that is beyond the scope of this article but here are a few things to consider about those questions for present purposesfirst the machine for my purposes here an ai machine or system consists of 1 hardware such as very fast computer processors 2 the software that runs on the hardware including an operating system and the instructions and algorithms that enable the machine to engage in cognitive functioning 3 input and output devices for the machine to take in information and instructions and to communicate or act on what it thinks such as sensors to enable it to ingest and process visual or audio information communication interfaces like text or speech and robotics to enable it to take certain actions like walking driving or flying and 4 data that the machine can store process and analyze so that it can learn and improve and the more of the right kind of data the bettermachines also require something that that counterintelligence officials need to think about lots of money and uniquely talented people to make it all happenthere is never enough money to go around and talented ai experts are exceedingly rare and therefore highly valuable so when you think about the impact value and counterintelligence risks associated with ai machines or systems you need to think holistically about this entire ecosystem ai exists in short in a context that integrates various subdisciplines and related fields including big data and big data analytics highspeed computing sensor technology and robotics including autonomous vehicles and systems and that also requires people and significant capitalnext what is thinking—and what about a corollary to thinking learning a comprehensive and completely accurate definition of “thinking” may not be possible and anyway is beyond the scope of this post the same might be true for “learning” and i’m not alan turing in any event and wouldn’t endeavor to try a rigorous test for either so for our purposes let’s just say that an ai machine or system can access or perceive information process it in some meaningful way learn from the information or stimuli to which it has access and improve its performance over time as russell and norvig highlight an ai system might think or act in ways that are analogous to what humans do or it might do so in some way that is rational but different from what humans would donow what about how ai systems act currently ai can perform certain specific or narrow functions “narrow ai” that humans can also perform such as processing and analyzing structured and unstructured data structured data includes formatted text documents unstructured data includes audio and video input or files so ai systems can evaluate large volumes of metadata emails or word documents for example and also understand speech recognize faces perceive physical objects and move in many instances ai can do these things faster better and more cheaply than people can in others ai systems are not as good as humans are many of these narrow ai advancements come together today in autonomous vehicles including cars drones and robots ai is also highly relevant to cybersecurity both offensively and defensively more on that in later posts and you probably use ai systems daily if for example you text friends using an iphone or google voicetotext system or if you use certain navigation appsa few other aspects of ai are relevant for this overall discussion as far as is known publicly ai does not yet exist at the level of human capability across the broad range of things that we can do both cognitively and physically ai that is at roughly the same level as humans is often referred to as artificial general intelligence agi artificial super intelligence—ai that exceeds human capabilities—would have profound implications for society and the human race see here and here for examplemany scholars doubt whether advancements such as agi and artificial super intelligence are possible i’ll leave that discussion to others but note one important feature of it for counterintelligence any nation or organization that achieved either of these breakthroughs would have substantial advantages over all of its competitors perhaps permanently imagine a country that could build a computer with agi or super intelligence and then scale that production and build an analytic army of those computers whether or not this is possible the dream of it both offensively and defensively—the desire to do it and the desire to preclude other countries from doing it and the desire to steal whatever progress anyone else may be making toward it—is a significant motivator for any number of international actors in other words the airelated fears reflected in “i robot” the “terminator” movies or “black mirror” may or may not have any merit or plausibility but they are a background factor even as we think about much more limited narrow ai applicationswhat’s more those narrower ai applications that exist already and that can reasonably be expected to emerge in the foreseeable future already present numerous opportunities and risks that will be challenging enough for the momentone additional background point it is important to discuss the difference between what is called “explainable ai” or “ethical ai” and what is sometimes referred to as “black box ai” the basic idea is simple an explainable ai is one in which a human can understand and explain what the ai did and why it did it an ethical ai is a system that is not biased in some unacceptable way for example with explainable and ethical ai we can answer basic questions such as why did the autonomous vehicle decide to turn left instead of right why does the ai think that the face in the surveillance camera video is the same as the one in the mug shot why did it translate this sentence from arabic into english in this fashion why does the ai think that this person is more likely than another person to commit a crime why does the ai think that person is not a good credit or insurance risk is the system biased for or against certain races or genders ai systems that we can’t understand are blackbox ai systems blackbox systems are the opposite of explainable systems and of ethical systems though a system can be explainable and still be biasedai systems can have biases that need to be understood those biases may come from the programmers who write the initial code to create the ai algorithms or from the data sets that the programmers exposed the ai to for it to learn or from some other source that people may not understand initially the worry here is that gender racial ethnic or some other bias may have unintentionally influenced the initial programming or selection of the data set for learning such biases can have profound effects on the outcomes that the ai produces something people need to be mindful and cautious about making sure that ai is explainable and ethical requires dedication and effort as i understand it the mathematics associated with some ai design today are so complicated that even the most advanced human mathematicians struggle to keep up developing and maintaining explainable and ethical ai systems will require effort and vigilance in later posts i’ll have more to say about some counterintelligence concerns i have about blackbox ai that expands on comments i made at a recent brookings eventwith that as a highlevel background on ai let’s consider a similarly highlevel background on the field of counterintelligence in subsequent posts i will explore why ai poses particular challenges for counterintelligence professionalscounterintelligence—an overviewcounterintelligence is a broad field and one shrouded in secrecy for obvious reasons at its core it is about spies and the people who try to catch them it is not possible for me to provide a comprehensive treatment of the field here but i’ll try to highlight a few key points that i think are at the root of what counterintelligence is about i have tried to make my points below regarding counterintelligence broadly applicable but i acknowledge that given my background they are more us and fbicentricas with ai it is important to define what we are talking about when we speak of counterintelligence one definition i find useful is that used in executive order no 12333 as amended which is the principal executive order governing the activities of the us intelligence community section 35a of the executive order states “counterintelligence means information gathered and activities conducted to identify deceive exploit disrupt or protect against espionage other intelligence activities sabotage or assassinations conducted for or on behalf of foreign powers organizations or persons or their agents or international terrorist organizations or activities” i will talk about various aspects of that definition below but mostly in relation to the activities of the foreign intelligence services of hostile foreign nations and their agents which can include actual officers of such services intelligence officers or “ios” but also individuals those services recruit coopt or dupe into assisting them in practice dealing with that threat is the main focus of counterintelligence agencies and the most dangerous threat faced by private organizations in the ai businessunder executive order 12333 several elements of the us intelligence community have counterintelligence responsibilities but the fbi has assumed the lead counterintelligence role within the united states the fbi which has been in the counterintelligence business since 1917 says that its main counterintelligence goals are toprotect the secrets of the us intelligence community using intelligence to focus investigative efforts and collaborating with our government partners to reduce the risk of espionage and insider threatsprotect the nation’s critical assets like our advanced technologies and sensitive information in the defense intelligence economic financial public health and science and technology sectorscounter the activities of foreign spies through proactive investigations the bureau identifies who they are and stops what they’re doingkeep weapons of mass destruction from falling into the wrong hands and use intelligence to drive the fbi’s investigative efforts to keep threats from becoming realitynotice as a preliminary matter that protecting the ai assets of the united states falls within the scope of those selfdefined goals and those goals are useful reference points for understanding the counterintelligence world but let’s dive in a bit deeper in order to set up a framework for comments i will make later about the airelated counterintelligence threat so here are 10 general points that i think are relevant to understanding the counterintelligence worldcounterintelligence is reactive counterintelligence is about stopping bad things from happening it is about identifying and countering the intelligence activities of hostile foreign intelligence services and other hostile foreign actors such as terrorist organizations this includes countering both clandestine intelligence gathering activities and other clandestine intelligence activities the former category is what many might think of as traditional spying the latter is more like conducting sabotage and secret influence and disinformation campaigns to manipulate a foreign population those “other” clandestine intelligence activities would fall within the category of what we in the united states would think of as “covert action”—activities seeking to influence political economic or military conditions abroad where it is intended that the role of the particular government is kept secretcounterintelligence is proactive to be effective counterintelligence must not be just reactive it also must be aggressively proactive so if you are a counterintelligence official you are proactively trying to collect information about the identities of your adversaries what they are thinking planning and doing and whom they have recruited coopted or fooled to help them you have to be willing to take thoughtful and wellconsidered risks in order to recruit sources inside hostile foreign intelligence services and on foreign soil you have to deploy sensitive technical collection techniques tactics and procedures to spy on adversaries all activities in this regard need to be intelligencedriven strategic and executed using the best possible tradecraftcounterintelligence is protective as a counterintelligence official you are trying to protect and defend the nation its people its assets and those of its allies from your adversaries indeed the motto of the british security service or mi5 as it is more widely known which is britain’s lead counterintelligence agency is “regnum defende” defence of the realm mi5 says that its “mission is to keep the country safe for more than a century we have worked to protect our people from danger whether it be from terrorism or damaging espionage by hostile states” you have to understand comprehensively and deeply what are the most important national assets to protectfor example you might need a comprehensive “heat map” of all the valuable assets of the entire nation or of a particular geographic region or of important sectors of the economy telecommunications system or the defense industrial base that you need to protect you might want a heat map of the ai ecosystem that catalogues clearly what assets you need to protect how vulnerable they are how effectively the risks to those assets have been mitigated and what gaps remain you also need to understand what the bad guys think they need to do regarding what you are trying to protect—in other words what do they think they need to steal or corrupt unfortunately you will never be certain about whether you or they have a better picture of what assets they should focus oncounterintelligence challenges are overwhelming there are too many adversaries and too much to protect in a free society you can’t defend against everyone everywhere all the time you have to prioritize the threats and what you are trying to protect your heat map will help too often the adversaries will wincounterintelligence is done at home counterintelligence activities occur mainly domestically even though they are focused on hostile foreign intelligence services of course adversaries operate globally and they will try to recruit and exploit americans abroad and will engage in malicious cyber activities anywhere but mostly they focus on the us homeland this means that counterintelligence authorities must find foreign intelligence operatives who are hiding domestically and mixing in and interacting with the very people you are trying to protect as a result it is often hard to find the bad guys as well as the americans who are helping them either wittingly or unwittingly this is the same type of problem counterterrorism officials facebecause all of this is happening at home counterintelligence activities intended to identify and disrupt intelligence threats domestically necessarily pose risks to the civil liberties of americans to be effective counterintelligence officials must engage in a range of intrusive clandestine activities in the united states intended to thwart their adversaries including electronic surveillance surreptitious searches recruitment of sources physical surveillance and undercover operations such activities undertaken here at home invariably implicate the rights of americans no matter how hard counterintelligence officials try to avoid doing socounterintelligence is confusing your adversary is actively trying to deceive you and it is hard to figure out what is going on it is easy to make mistakes—you can easily miss real threats plots and actors and you can waste time resources and effort following the wrong people or countering the wrong or nonexistent plot your adversary is trying to get you to be complacent or chase your tail and if you are not careful it is all too easy to let that happencounterintelligence is sophisticated effective foreign intelligence services are very important for the security political stability and economic wellbeing of nations foreign intelligence collection provides national leaders and government agencies with the information they need to make informed military diplomatic economic and other important decisions anticipate and address the actions of foreign nations and protect the nation from attack sabotage and other threatening activities by adversaries as a result countries are going to invest a lot in making sure that their intelligence services can defeat counterintelligence efforts to stop themaccordingly foreign intelligence adversaries are well resourced experienced dedicated motivated and aggressive they use complex novel and subtle means to defeat counterintelligence services they recruit and place sources they coopt or threaten insiders they conduct physical and electronic surveillance and breakins and they engage in sophisticated intelligence tradecraft to obscure their activities and deceive adversaries and innocent third parties moreover the spy business has changed a great deal over the years with the advent of the internet and the explosion of opensource information and intelligence activities are now inextricably intertwined with the digital ecosystem malicious cyber activities and advanced perception management and manipulation campaignsthe essence of the clandestine intelligencegathering business ie espionage is to collect secret information by secret means in other words a someone wants to protect information data technology weapons systems or other important assets from being stolen damaged or destroyed b spies want to steal or do other bad things to those assets and c the spies want to do so if at all possible in a way that keeps the victim from knowing or understanding what happened from the spy’s perspective it is best if the victim never knows that something was stolen or corrupted or if the victim does find out that something bad happened to the asset that the victim does not know the identity or role of the spy in the activityus counterintelligence officials must figure out how to deal with all of this and while they have to adhere strictly to the constitution and laws of the united states their adversaries follow different rules or no rules at all the same is true for our closest foreign partners who must follow the rules of their own countriessome people have likened the counterterrorism challenge to that faced by a soccer team that cannot allow the opposing side to score even one goal in both the counterterrorism and counterintelligence contexts the situation is actually much worse imagine that the soccer team not only needs to prevent the opposing team from scoring any goals but also has to deal with an opposing side that may be either invisible or wearing uniforms identical to their own that plays by different rules or no rules at all that can score by leaving the field and lifting up the net from behind and putting the ball in for a goal and that all of this is happening on a field that is undulating and otherwise changing constantly because of the dynamic nature of technology the economy and the intelligence needs of adversaries counterintelligence is hard and requires sophistication in part because the environment can be highly disorientingfor a variety of reasons the field of counterintelligence has at times been considered a backwater by some and has played second fiddle to efforts to address ordinary crime before 911 and counterterrorism after 911 counterintelligence investigations however present some of the most complex and vexing problems that a national security agency can face for example the counterintelligence investigations of robert hanssen the russian illegals network eventually known as “ghost stories” the russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election and a plethora of cyberenabled foreign intelligence activities by china and others demonstrate the sophisticated nature of counterintelligence work in order to disrupt appropriately the activities of foreign intelligence services while preserving the longterm efficacy of their sensitive sources and methods counterintelligence officials are regularly called upon to make hard choices about whether when and how to carry out affect such disruptionscounterintelligence is forever hostile foreign intelligence services represent persistent threats nationstate adversaries generally don’t go away or give up even if regimes change for example the fbi has been dealing with intelligence threats from the soviet union and the russian federation since 1917 the fbi will be dealing with the intelligence threat from china for as long as it exists to be sure the clandestine intelligence activities of foreign powers change over time depending upon the needs of the country and developments in fields such as science and technology politics and the economy so counterintelligence officials must be adaptive and creative over an extended periodcounterintelligence is powerful the fbi has all of its national security and law enforcement authorities available to use against hostile foreign intelligence services and their agents it can leverage the resources of its partners in the us intelligence community other federal agencies its foreign intelligence counterintelligence and law enforcement partners around the globe and approximately 18000 domestic law enforcement agencies it has the authority and capability to conduct highly intrusive electronic surveillance and searches of americans and others in the united states generally without ever being required to tell them that it did so it can arrest americans and others in the united states and seek the arrest and extradition of anyone anywherebut as many casual observers do not understand arrest and prosecution of foreign intelligence operatives are not the only ways to thwart the intelligence activities of hostile foreign adversaries without going into much detail here counterintelligence officials have a range of other options available to identify understand and disrupt the activities of foreign powers and their agents these include recruiting and doublingback sources the adversaries themselves have recruited ie “double agents” deporting foreign nationals with the help of the department of homeland security and kicking foreign diplomats out of the country with the help of the state department providing information to support diplomatic actions or the imposition of economic sanctions public exposure and providing defensive briefings to individuals or organizations that are being targeted by a hostile service counterintelligence officials can accomplish their mission even if no one is ever prosecuted or jailed and they will continue their mission even if there is no prospect of arrests and prosecutionscombined with the forever nature of counterintelligence
