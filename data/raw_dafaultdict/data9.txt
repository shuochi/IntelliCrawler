strategylike digital transformation before it establishing an enterprise artificial intelligence strategy is so new there is no playbook to crib from and even if a playbook did exist cios would still have to contend with the ongoing proliferation of technology meaning theyd have to customize their investments in ai and plans of action as ai tools evolvethe good news is that early adopters of ai arent operating in a vacuum they can rely on triedandtrue methods for building a new technology competency such as creating a center of excellence by establishing an artificial intelligence center of excellence coe companies can formalize their vision for and approach to aimilind wagle global cio at data center provider equinix inc is just beginning to make a case for an enterprise artificial intelligence strategy hes tapped members of his enterprise architecture team to keep tabs on the market and to uncover potential use cases and his team has also taken on a couple of projects to prove out the value of artificial intelligence investmentsone such project is an internal chatbot embedded into the corporate intranet that helps with things like employee training submitting expense reports and ordering new equipment we call it eva wagle said and its a conversational interface that lets the employee community get answers to a whole bunch of questions in a very contextrich mannerbut these efforts are new and while wagle is optimistic about where artificial intelligence is headed hes found that the technologies for use in the enterprise are still immature right now hes busy setting the groundworkas these technologies mature as we start to get more traction we are going to put some investment behind this in terms of resourcing and governance and create a team around it he said its like any other it capability that you launch if youre getting traction then theres a need to nurture enhance and support it and that will require investment and effortwagle doesnt call this team an artificial intelligence center of excellence but he could centers of excellence are often established to deal with new technologies skills or disciplines that dont fit neatly into the enterprise their aim is to provide governance and to prioritize efforts and they can help companies avoid classic pitfalls such as a tendency to focus on technology rather than use casefor most enterprises its very important that they start from the business perspective said bern elliot an analyst at gartner the artificial intelligence center of excellence is a way to help address the technical needs while also balancing it with the business needswalking the line between shiny new tech and what the business really needs is especially delicate for artificial intelligence its the advances in technology that are propelling the conversation in the first place encouraging companies to focus on possibility rather than concrete business problems but elliot said thats a big mistakeno one does anything with a neural network he said referring to the deep learning technique modeled after the hierarchical arrangement of neurons in biological sensory systems its really the applications of ai that make ai usefulrather than a single artificial intelligence center of excellence elliot teased out three strategic components to consider ai business innovation ai policies and governance and an ai skills center of excellence cios need to keep tabs on all three he saidthe business innovation piece is conducted in consultation with the lines of business to determine what applications and uses cases are most important and how they should be prioritizedthe ai policies and governance piece establishes guidelines on what to watch out for and best practices to follow you will be using data extensively in some cases he said in others you may be exposing the application to customers and you want to make sure its done in the right wayonce a project has been selected companies will need to get their skills house in order thats where the skills center of excellence comes into play the skills coe can include general skills such as data science and data analytics skills as well as aispecific skills such as deep neural networks and natural language understanding the artificial intelligence skills center of excellence is a way to help marshal and manage your skills he saidin many cases a skills team member wont be reassigned to the artificial intelligence skills center of excellence permanently instead team members will participate virtually tapped to help with a project based on how their particular skills applyfinally the skills coe doesnt have to be internal employees only in some cases these are difficult skills to develop elliot said or it may not be in a companys best interest to hire and train employees who leave a couple of years later because their market value is significantly higherthis is a perennial problem when a new technology comes along he said its why companies go to consultants because they get a skills solution provider who comes in and helps complete a project the company can maintain the relationship but they dont have to retain the staffmoiz kohari senior vice president and chief technology architect at state street corp in boston said being fully virtual is key to an artificial intelligence strategy in fact hes pushing back against an artificial intelligence center of excellence precisely because it conjures up the idea of a physical groupas a global company with talent scattered from china to boston and everywhere in between kohari said he finds the physicality of a traditional coe to be shortsighted we find it much more useful to be able to direct the right minds to the right problems he saidhis model is inspired in part by the open source community experts from around the world dont have to be working out of the same room on a project like the linux kernel a unixlike operating system the way it works is you have maintainers of certain areas of the project and you have contributors to that project he said contributors submit code to a githublike environment where its reviewed and accepted before its approved by project maintainers that kind of workflow exists at state streetby giving up the idea of a physical coe state street can think about leadership on a global rather than local scale we find that hiring the best minds wherever they may be is the most beneficial approach for us kohari saidthe company has identified specific technology areas it believes are critical to the financial institutions future including anomaly detection natural language processing and predictive analytics for each technology theyve sought to create a nucleus an expert or a couple of experts who can build a team and oversee projects that address business challenges in these areasthese nuclei are absolute rock stars in their fields im not just saying that kohari said these are guys who arent only contributing to projects but started or were founders of some of those projects he saidstate street supports their nuclei by embedding management talent onto the team to keep track of a projects progress the last thing you want to do is take one of the smartest people who works on anomaly libraries for anomaly detection and burden them with management challenges he saidnicole

recent years has shifted to the hottest artificial intelligence stocks to diversify their portfolio in a growing industryartificial intelligence stocks are becoming more and more attractive because of the popularity of the internet of things iot and the smart home artificial intelligence is powering the next evolution in smart homes and the connected lifestyleevery device that consumers use to stay connected is talking to the cloud all of this data is providing companies that leverage ai an opportunity to delight their customers by providing things they didn’t realize they wanted but is obvious based on the digital breadcrumbs they’re creatingif you’re looking for the hottest artificial intelligence stocks to add to your 2018 portfolio you’d be wise to add the following to your investor watchlistlicensed wikimedianvidia is aggressively invested in the artificial intelligence space they have leveraged their gaming graphics card division to create supercomputers that use video card technology to facilitate deep learning these massively powerful supercomputers can delve into large swaths of data analyze the information that’s available and help create actionable insights for researchers ceos and governmentsnvidia has also benefited greatly from the popularity of cryptocurrencies and the folding infrastructure required to support bitcoin and other invogue currency alternatives nvidia’s highend gaming graphics cards have shot up in price due to the increased demand – from just a gaming product to a fintech workhorselicense tnwcdncomthe most interesting data comes from the way people communicate voice and text communication provides unbelievable insight into how people engage with one another think and interact metadata – the information about who spoke to who when they spoke and how long they spoke – has always been easy to ascertain but deep analysis of text and voice communication has been a challenge voice is the most challengingvcs and other investors have rewarded twilio’s breakthroughs in voice and text comm analysis with a 38 billion valuation there’s a little risk with this play though the company’s valuation is extremely high – especially for a company that is not wellknown throughout the market but their proprietary technology and its use could make twilio one of the hottest ai stocks in 2018license wikimedia commonswhenever you think ai or big data you should think “microchips” every computer and server has a series of microchips to process all of the calculations being thrown at it nand and dram chips are specifically being leveraged to facilitate ai and big data machine learning initiativesas ai moves into the foreground and more companies jump to leverage its capabilities we are going to witness a continued sharp uptick in demand for the types of components that micron produces it may not be the most exciting play but would you rather be the panhandler looking for gold or the company store

portfolio if you’re okay with investing in a chinese company – carefully consider their nefarious trackrecord of violating international contract and patent laws – baidu is a great place to startai and ml tech relies on the size of a data sample to scale up quickly the larger the sample size the more analytical conclusions can be made china has the world’s largest population and baidu has direct access to the digital interactions of this population with such a big sample size some analysts believe that baidu will pull ahead in the race to provide ai insights to the global markettencent to many is seen as the chinese equivalence of facebook but it’s more complex than that tencent has a variety of products in operation in a variety of industries there are a number of interactions online that tencent has access to – which can be fed into their ai effortstencent made headlines when they opened an ai research lab in seattle headed by a microsoft research veteran this is a powerful chinese tech giant with tentacles throughout the global marketplace with a heavy focus on the future of aiinvestors would be unwise to ignore tencent as part of their ai stock portfoliocopyright

launched google has long shown an interest in ai – a technology that makes their classleading search engine possiblesundar pichai the ceo of google announced last year that they are doubling down on

confirm that i have read and accepted the terms of use and declaration of consentand artificial intelligence i came away wondering why theyre so far apartboth involve number crunching at their core but while bi is primarily retrospective in nature ai is all about the future the statistical analysis behind bi is primarily about basic counts in contrast with the ultrasophisticated machine learning and deep learning algorithms that underpin aibecause of these differences and the fact that ai as a useful tool is relatively new while bi is yesterdays news we treat the two disciplines as wholly separate during my time at the oreilly ai conference in new york in late june i heard not a single mention of bi conversely at dresner advisory services llcs real business intelligence conference held on the campus of mit in july ai was primarily used as a counterpoint to bi in discussions of the latters strong business value and high adoptionbut speaker mico yuk ceo of consultancy bi brainz in atlanta had an interesting idea im hoping that with more machine learning key performance indicators will grow and evolve she said im hoping we can work on metrics using data science and make kpis work for you rather than you working for themin her vision machine learning algorithms deployed in bi software will tell businesses whats interesting in their historical data right now analysts typically have to define metrics for bi tools to track its a manual process and it only makes visible data the company already knows is importantbut machine learningenabled bi could delve deeper into a business unknown unknowns finding insights in previously unexamined data taken a step further aipowered bi could take advantage of natural language generation capabilities to explain to the business what these insights mean and how they might act on themthis isnt exactly a revolutionary idea bi vendor sisense announced in april a data discovery component to its software that automatically reviews data and alerts users to new and potentially interesting features other vendors are also adding machine learning components to their software analyst firm gartner has been talking about smart data discovery since at least 2015 but it wasnt until this springs magic quadrant report on bi and analytics platforms that gartner declared smart data discovery the next disruptor in the bi software marketthere is some momentum around the idea of combining machine learning business intelligence and artificial intelligence but based on my reporting the idea seems to have seeped little into the general publics consciousness we still mostly see ai and bi as separate domainsthis has to change think of all the time aipowered bi platforms could free up for analysts who currently spend much of their time handling requests for reports they could move on to more effective data science and predictive analytics projects weve seen from companies like uber and google that smart approaches to machine learning can create entirely new profitable business models thats the kind of thing people with strong analytics skills should be spending their time onmaybe once the hype surrounding ai starts to wear off the differences between it and bi will seem smaller and the opportunity more obvious after all were already seeing ai having a big impact on crm hr and fintech software theres no

intelligence', 'h2': 'sebastian ulbert', 'h5': 'artificial intelligence aiartificial general intelligence agiartificial superintelligence asi', 'p': 'coresystems is now part of sap3 april 2017 3 minwhat exactly is artificial intelligence and what is the difference between general intelligence and super intelligence can we expect benevolent robots to be walking amongst us in the near future40 years ago today science fiction’s most iconic film was released star wars gave us two of our most beloved onscreen robots though r2d2 and c3po were far more advanced than anything existing then and even now artificial intelligence was already well on its way when the film premiered in fact the father of ai had already designed a test to determine a machine’s intelligence back in 1950 the turing test created by mathematician and computer scientist alan turing asked a judge to field a series of questions to two participants one machine and one human based on the responses the judge would then determine the human responder the computer was deemed intelligent if it was able to fool the judge at least 50 percent of the timesimply put artificial intelligence refers to a machine’s ability to imitate human cognitive abilities like problem solving and learning these skills also require an understanding of language and speech and strategic thinking we already encounter numerous applications of artificial intelligence on a daily basis when we ask siri for directions when driving past google’s autonomous vehicles when we use selfparking or cruise control featureshowever inspired by film and literature many people are more familiar with the concept of artificial general intelligence agi computers would be equally intelligent to humans in every aspect these machines would be capable of performing the same kind of intellectual tasks that humans perform with the same level of success apple’s cofounder steve wozniak developed the coffee test as an indicator for agi during the test a robot has to enter an average home and attempt to make coffee this means finding all the tools figuring out how they operate and then performing the task a robot able to complete this test would be considered an example of agi think c3pobut what about hal 9000 the 2001 a space odyssey horror computer is also still currently the stuff of fiction this field of ai is called artificial superintelligence and it is also the field of research that stephen hawking has warned us about one of ai’s leading figures nick bostrom has defined superintelligence as “an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field including scientific creativity general wisdom and social skills” this slight or vast superiority to human intellect is disconcerting to scientists and laymen because its outcome is unknown a machine capable of constantly learning and improving itself could be unstoppablewhere exactly is ai headed some of the most exciting advancements in ai are a result of selflearning and analytics for examplea study published by nature outlined the work of a team of researchers on “simulated childhood” this is a robot’s ability to detect a malfunction and use a process of trial and error to determine the defect and repair it in a matter of minutes the robots tested could identify a problem and determine the best ways to fix itself the robots could repair 14 forms of damagein 2013 a computer had the intelligence level of a 4year old child in 2014 a computer was able to solve a mathematical problem so complex that the most intelligent human minds could not check for accuracy computer scientist and futurist ray kurzweil said that computer intelligence would reach human levels by 2029by analyzing data from over 100 million articles sgi altix supercomputer nautilus was able to predict the future the computer could assess tone and mood connect it to geographical locations and use that information to foresee internet entrepreneur kalev leetaru who fed the computer all the information considers it akin to weather forecasting “its never perfect but we can do better than random guessing”it is clear that ai has resulted in machines that are in many ways more capable than human minds however it will be a long time before they are able to surpass human intelligence in every regard and should this day come the brightest minds in the field are well aware of the risks of superintelligent computers and should be able to thwart any hal 9000’s before it’s too latefind out how to become an industry leader in

robots certainly every kid who goes on to work at cnet in any caseas we veer ever closer to the year 2016 my scififuelled childhood fantasies of a bot with a brain the size of a planet are closer than ever to being realised 2015 saw drones taking to the skies while back on the ground artificial intelligence programs are achieving aboveaverage scores on college entrance exams artificial intelligence or ai is the practice of making a machine behave in a practical responsive way its already changing our world and is by my reckoning the most fascinating field of technology right nowbut as one professor i spoke to for this story put it the audacity of the attempt to build an intelligent machine comes with a responsibility to know what were meddling with for everyone who ever thumbed through a copy of i robot mouth agape heres what you need to know about ai in the modern worldmention the phrase killer robot in conversation and youll almost certainly raise a smile your peers doubtless imagining a glowing blue humanoid cyborg sadly pondering what is love before its eyes turn red and it selfdestructs obliterating the northern hemisphereclick here for more stories in cnets most exciting tech seriesdeeply ingrained in modern pop culture is the notion that some manner of ai uprising is on the cards james camerons iconic image of a terminator stamping on a mound of human skulls is never far from any geeks thoughtsthat playful cinematic and deeply poetic cultural artifact belies the very real threat humanity faces however not from killer robots overthrowing their human masters but from intelligent robots following ordersthe immediate threat experts warn comes in the form of autonomous weapons military machines capable of killing without permission from a human from unmanned planes to missile defence systems to sentry robots weve already got military hardware that functions with very little input from a human mindgroups such as the campaign to stop killer robots say were inching ever closer to closing the loop and letting machines handle our killing for us a scenario thats legally pragmatically and of course ethically problematicthe less sensationally named future of life institute recently published an open letter signed by hundreds of ai researchers and famous tech personalities warning if any major military power pushes ahead with ai weapon development a global arms race is virtually inevitable and the endpoint of this technological trajectory is obvious autonomous weapons will become the kalashnikovs of tomorrowthe campaign to stop killer robots a coalition of more than 50 nongovernmental organisations claims its making progress towards a treaty one akin to the international agreement outlawing chemical weapons the un has already hosted discussions on the subject of autonomous murderbots one huge obstacle facing these groups however is that to rave about imminent robot slaughter makes you look like a crackpot whos watched the matrix one too many timeshumanity needs to revise its popcultureinstilled notion that robots becoming selfaware and robots wiping out humanity will occur simultaneously machines that become smart enough to ponder their own existence may certainly be a problem decades down the line but phenomenal advances in ai mean that robots that kill without even being programmed to understand the barest concept of mercy are uncomfortably closeartificial intelligence takes many forms and while weve successfully programmed machines to clean our floors set alarms on our phones park our cars and take out military installations from above the clouds things like introspection and selfawareness are proving a little toughertelling a joke making an ethical judgement deciding that you want to collaborate with some individuals and not others this rich texture of human life isnt there in our machines at all said sir nigel shadbolt professor of computer science at oxford universityfor decades humans have looked forward to the socalled singularity the moment of selfawareness that creates an explosion in selfimproving machine intelligence this will be triggered its presumed by the exponential growth of computing power coupled with advancing software complexityfuturist ray kurzweil predicted in a 2005 book that a model of human intelligence would be achieved as soon as the mid 2020s what appears to be the case now however is that the complexity of our own minds the key that gives rise to consciousness is a lot more well complicated than we imaginedthat spark of awareness in your head we dont know where that comes from shadbolt said the complexity we embody that allows consciousness to happen isnt just by the fact that weve got this kind of cortex this rational brain we have an endocrine system were emotional we have the threelayer brainwe are extraordinarily complex and we have only begun to unpack just a tiny amount of that at this pointits still the hard problem shadbolt said later joking when i ask what the biggest public misconception is concerning ai that its just 10 years down the roadthat sentiment is shared by murray shanahan professor of cognitive robotics at imperial college london who told me the media often gives the impression that humanlevel ai of the sort we see in scifi movies is just around the corner but its almost certainly decades awaytwo of the major problems shanahan explained are endowing computers and robots with a common sense understanding of the everyday world and endowing them with creativity by creativity i dont mean the sort of thing we see in the picassos or einsteins of the world but rather the sort of thing that every child is capable offrom the terminator series to movies such as i robot chappie ex machina and even short circuit the way we portray ai on screen has traditionally been humancentric we tend to imagine a being that essentially looks and acts a lot like a person as ai spreads into every aspect of our life we should be prepared to broaden our horizons when it comes to imagining the bounds and types of intelligence that can be valuable after all weve got plenty of humangrade intelligence alreadythe point cant be just to replicate ourselves shadbolt said weve got very interesting biological ways of doing that so why on earth would we want to do it in siliconfrom the humble roomba to googles animallike selfdriving car siri or neural networks that oversee data centres ai is branching out in ways we couldnt have imagined decades ago if you define intelligence in a way thats more machinecentric professor alan woodward told me last year in an interview on the fading relevance of the turing test youll find some very intelligent machines out there alreadythat diversity in the kinds of ai now emerging may in part come down to the breadth of disciplines currently investigating machine intelligence theres a broad range of subjects now that look at the problem shadbolt said psychologists look at it from a human context there are animal psychologists physiologists neuroscientists ai practitioners all looking at it with a different anglefundamentally well need an interdisciplinary approach so for me there isnt one single discipline that will have all the answersthats the face of modern ai taskcentric wildly diverse intelligent systems essentially mindless for now but busily changing every aspect of human life nonetheless whether its public transport or patrolling the skies the ai of today is nothing like the gloomy glowing cyborg we once pictured its

lists saving you from manually looking for materials relevant to the conversation ai coupled with a virtual voice assistant like amazons alexa for business microsofts cortana google assistant or apples siri could enable natural language data queries for example you could say hey cortana pull up the q4 sales figures and projections for q1 next year if deploying an ai engine to listen to discussions in a meeting or read textbased conversations in a team app the agent could then offer assistance such as would you like me to schedule a task for john to develop budget projections for the new marketing campaignrealtime language translation which enables global workgroups to communicate and collaborate in their native languages and receive native language meeting transcriptions efficient schedules such as calendar systems or meeting applications enabled to automatically schedule future calls based on a projects schedule and availability without individuals having to manually search calendars for availability or worse yet exchange emails to find an appropriate meeting time quicker feedback by integrating chatbots into team applications to enable native language collaboration capabilities such as polling team participants for a status update or providing alerts to team members when the ai engine detects an anomaly in a related business process for example a systems failure could trigger ai tools to create popup messages in the team apps or new conversation channels and it could automatically input relevant datathe ai application could recognize individuals as they enter a meeting room prompting the meeting system to say hi julie i see you have a 400 pm status meeting would you like me to start it this saves time starting audio video and web conferencing bridges as well as retrieving digital whiteboards and shared files it could take attendance by visually or audibly recognizing employees as they join meetings and the ai could use data analytics to help facilities and uc managers gain insight into how meeting spaces are being used how many people are in a typical meeting and how long they use the roomcompliance and security it leaders especially those in regulated industries are likely to be wary about ais access to corporate information and the way that information is stored within ai engines as ai platforms become targets for attack expect to pay closer attention to how that data is protected reliance on cloud the computing power required for ai as well as the need for rapid application evolution typically means that ai platforms are cloudbased and use microservicesbased architectures that leads to data security issues as well the need to ensure that data is stored in accordance with standards like the general data protection regulation business case many of the previously described scenarios are difficult to quantify for enterprises trying to determine return on investment vendors likely will integrate aidriven applications into their current offerings rather than sell separate tools requiring their own licenses or software acquisitions still enterprises will incur costs related to training and it support that they will need to balance with measurable productivity gains and process improvements it leaders will want to ensure that they have the necessary visibility into business processes to

'contact ussubscriptionscommercial', 'p': 'artificial intelligence throws up a range of legal issues says luis franco of pérezllorcaolga nikonovathe idea of artificial intelligence ‘ai’ has been around since the times of antiquity even if the actual term was coined centuries later at dartmouth college in 1956 certainly we find many examples of thinking machines in ancient myths and in more recent years the literature and film industries have recurrently drawn upon that idea to create all kinds of stories and ultimately that is how many people see ai as an idea bound up with the realm of myths and science fictionhowever this preconception may soon change considering some of the recent developments in this area selfparking cars are already available on the market and according to major car manufacturers’ expectations selfdriven cars will arrive in 5 to 10 years’ time unmanned aircrafts and drones are becoming increasingly common in many fields border control package delivery etc we also have several examples of programmes with certain learning capabilities web ads search engines like google search or apps like siri and viv which use a natural language user interface adapting to the users individual language usage and individual preferences with continuing use and returning individualized resultscertainly the opinion of a significant section of the scientific community seems to be that ai will arrive shortly considering that in the past few months several renowned scientists have emphasized the risks of ai and the need for worldwide regulation on the subject the best example of this is the open letter recently published by the future of life institute “fli” which has been signed by a number of respected scientists including elon musk cofounder of paypal tesla motors and spacex or preeminent astrophysicist dr stephen hawkinsthe letter includes a list of research priorities which put forward several interesting and complex questions requiring an adequate solution we do not presume to have any or all of the answers but we would like to outline some of the most complicated aspects and propose some additional questions to considershort term horizon autonomous systemsconsidering the short term research priorities set out in fli’s letter what we can hope to expect from ai in the near future are increasingly autonomous systems such as selfdriven cars autonomous trading systems more efficient information managing programmes fully automated factories etc from a legal perspective we would be interested in exploring one of its most fundamental aspects which is potential liability in the event of damages caused by an autonomous systemfli’s letter addresses this issue in connection with liability for accidents caused by selfdriven cars although this concern could be extended to drones and other automated vehiclesfirstly who exactly should be taking out the premiums of the obligatory insurance policies associated with the vehicle the ratio legis behind mandatory insurance policies is that a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous and thus its owner must guarantee cover for any damages caused by it however if control over the vehicle is taken from the owner and given to an autonomous system it could be argued that it should be its manufacturer who bears the cost of the insurance policy or perhaps that it should be shared between the manufacturer and the ownera different question would be the actual allocation of liability in the event of an accident assuming that all control over the vehicle is taken away from the driver for lack of a better word how could heshe be held liable for the damages caused in an accident thus we need to explore the potential liability of the manufacturerif the damages were caused due to a faulty design malfunction andor assembly of the vehicle the matter does not present any particular complexity as in such an event it is clear that the manufacturer should be held liablehowever liabilities cannot be so easily allocated if no malfunction is involved in the accident for example if a system which is working properly detects a potential risk but cannot react fast enough current legal doctrine would dictate that no liability should be allocated to the manufacturer if the system was working in accordance with current scientific knowledge and technology and had been approved by the relevant public authorityconsidering the above the standards set by the public authorities in order to approve any given autonomous system will have to be carefully measured in order to set these standards a consideration of paramount importance and great complexity is how a system should ponder the potential risk of causing injury to a person versus the risk of causing economic damagesobviously human life and health should always be prioritised over property damage thus when probabilities are levelled the system should avoid the chance of causing personal injury and assume the risk of causing economic damages however if the probability of causing personal injury is very small the answer might be different indeed if we took the avoidance of risk to humans to extremes we could reach a point where no system would operate since there would always be such a risk however there is a huge grey area in the middle where several factors should be considered in order to set boundaries which would constitute a sorites paradoxof course there are many other questions that autonomous systems will bring up from a legal perspective for example issues related to privacy and security of personal data can autonomous systems share personal data or labourrelated matterslong term sapient selfaware systemsin the long term the questions and challenges will become far more complex and challenging as they will exceed the boundaries of both computer science and laws and will enter into the territory of ethics philosophy and even religion similarly to other highly controversial fields of scientific investigation such as human cloning stem cell research or genetic engineeringif a truly sapient machine could ultimately be created which in view of fli’s letter seems conceivable it will likely be a turning point in human history the potential benefits and indeed risks are immense and a lot of them may probably be far beyond what we currently consider as even remotely possible as will be the questions that will need to be answeredindeed we may have to consider if such sapient machines should have a legal cybernetic personality and whether they could be held liable we may also have to ask ourselves if those machines can own property and have other civil rights or even if they can be actually owned or on the contrary if owning a truly sapient selfaware creature even if an artificial one would be tantamount to slaveryperhaps some of these ideas might seem farfetched and even somewhat shocking however rather than providing any answers these are merely questions that the legal community and other professionals should begin to think aboutnew questionsthe development of artificial intelligence which is likely to speed up in the near future will bring forth new and complex questions to which no legal system in the world has an answer it is therefore necessary for the legal community to begin to consider the answersluis franco is a

lawgeex a tel aviv legaltech startupwhats artificial intelligence ai and why should lawyers care about it on a practical level lawyers should be aware that software powered by ai already carries out legal tasks within a few years ai will be taking over or at least affecting a significant amount of work now done by lawyers thirtynine percent of inhouse counsel expect that ai will be commonplace in legal work within ten yearson a more philosophical level lawyers should understand that the decisions made by aipowered software will raise significant legal questions including those of tort liability and of criminal guilt for example if ai is controlling a driverless car and someones killed in an accident whos at faultwhile the philosophical questions are important to resolve this comment will focus on the practical issues to provide an overview of what ai is and how it will be used in the legal profession this comment addresses several questionslets start with a few definitionsartificial intelligence is the term used to describe how computers can perform tasks normally viewed as requiring human intelligence such as recognizing speech and objects making decisions based on data and translating languages ai mimics certain operations of the human mindmachine learning is an application of ai in which computers use algorithms rules embodied in software to learn from data and adapt with experiencea neural network is a computer that classifies information putting things into buckets based on their characteristics the hotdog identifying app from hbos silicon valley is an example of one application of this technologysome ai programs train themselves through trial and error for example using a technique called neuroevolution researchers at elon musks openai research center set up an algorithm with policies for getting high scores on atari videogames several hundred copies of these rules were created on different computers with random variations the computers then played the games to learn which policies were most effective and fed those results back into the system ai can also be used to build better ai google is building algorithms that analyze other algorithms to learn which methods are more successfulother ai programs need to be trained by humans feeding them data the ai then derives patterns and rules from that data ai programs trained through machine learning are wellsuited to solve classification problems this basically means calculating the probability that certain information is either of type a or type b for example determining whether a given bear is a panda or a koala is a classification problemthe training starts with showing the computer lots of samples of pandas and koalas these initial samples are called the training set and clearly identify which type of bear is being presented to the aithe ai builds a modela set of rulesto distinguish between pandas and koalas that model might be based on things like size coloring the shape of the ears and what the animal eats bamboo or eucalyptusafter training the ai can be tested with new pandas and koalas to see whether it classifies them correctly if it doesnt do very well the algorithm may need to be tweaked or the training set may need to be expanded to give the ai more data to crunchat this point in its development ai is good at finding items that meet humandefined criteria and detecting patterns in data in other words ai can figure out what makes a panda a panda and what distinguishes it from a koalawhich lets it find the pandas in a collection of random bears these are sometimes called searchandfind type tasksonce its identified something the ai can then apply humandefined rules and take actions in the case of legal work an ai can carry out tasks likeaccording to stefanie yuen thio joint managing partner and head of corporate at tsmp law corp in singapore legal work thats repetitive requiring minimal professional intervention or based on a template will become the sole province of software in addition she saysai can help consumers by providing a form of legal service to clients who might otherwise not be able to afford a lawyer the free service donotpay created by a 19yearold is an aipowered chatbot that lets users contest parking tickets in london and new york in its first 21 months it took on 250000 cases and won 160000 of them saving users more than 4 million worth of fines the same program is helping consumers file databreachrelated suits against equifax for up to 25000though it cant help them litigate their casesaccording to yuen thio ai cant yet replicate advocacy negotiation or structuring of complex deals the new york times suggested that tasks like advising clients writing briefs negotiating deals and appearing in court were beyond the reach of computerization at least for a while ai also isnt yet very good at the type of creative writing in a supreme court brief or a movie scriptlawyers are already using ai to do things like reviewing documents during litigation and due diligence analyzing contracts to determine whether they meet predetermined criteria performing legal research and predicting case outcomesdocument review for litigation involves the task of looking for relevant documentsfor example documents containing specific keywords or emails from ms x to mr y concerning topic z during march 2016 setting search parameters for document review doesnt require ai but using ai improves the speed accuracy and efficiency of document analysisfor example when lawyers using aipowered software for document review flag certain documents as relevant the ai learns what type of documents its supposed to be looking for hence it can more accurately identify other relevant documents this is called predictive coding predictive coding offers many advantages over oldschool manual document review among other things itpredictive coding has been widely accepted as a document review method by us courts since the 2012 decision in da silva moore v publicus groupeclients need to analyze contracts both in bulk and on an individual basisfor example analysis of all contracts a company has signed can identify risks anomalies future financial obligations renewal and expiration dates etc for companies with hundreds or thousands of contracts this can be a slow expensive laborintensive and errorprone process assuming the contracts arent already entered into a robust contract management system its also boring for the lawyers or others tasked with doing iton a daytoday basis lawyers review contracts make comments and redlines and advise clients on whether to sign contracts asis or try to negotiate better terms these contracts can range from simple eg ndas to complex a backlog of contracts to review can create a bottleneck that delays deals and the associated revenues lawyers especially inexperienced ones can miss important issues that can come back to bite their clients laterai can help with both bulk and individual contract reviewat jpmorgan an aipowered program called coin has been used since june 2017 to interpret commercial loan agreements work that previously took 360000 lawyerhours can now be done in seconds the bank is planning to use the technology for other types of legal documents as wellsome ai platforms such as the one provided by kira systems allow lawyers to identify extract and analyze business information contained in large volumes of contract data this is used to create contract summary charts for ma due diligencethe company i work for lawgeex uses ai to analyze contracts one at a time as part of a lawyers daily workflow to start with lawyers set up their lawgeex playbooks by selecting from a list of clauses and variations to require accept or reject for example a california governing law clause might be ok but genovian law isnt then when someone uploads a contract the ai scans it and determines what clauses and variations are present and missing the relevant language is highlighted and marked with a green thumbsup or a red thumbsdown based on the clients preset criteriainhouse lawyers use lawgeex to triage standard agreements like ndas contracts meeting predefined criteria can be preapproved for signature those that dont are kicked to the legal department for further review and revisionany lawyer whos ever done research using lexis or westlaw has used legal automation finding relevant cases in previous eras involving the laborious process of looking up headnote numbers and shepardizing in paper volumes but ai takes research to the next level for example ross intelligence uses the power of ibms watson supercomputer to find similar cases it can even respond to queries in plain english the power of aienabled research is striking using common research methods a bankruptcy lawyer found a case nearly identical to the one he was working on in 10 hours rosss ai found it almost instantlylawyers are often called upon to predict the future if i bring this case how likely is it that ill win and how much will it cost me should i settle this case or take a plea or take my chances at trial more experienced lawyers are often better at making accurate predictions because they have more years of data to work withhowever no lawyer has complete knowledge of all the relevant databecause ai can access more of the relevant data it can be better than lawyers at predicting the outcomes of legal disputes and proceedings and thus helping clients make decisions for example a london law firm used data on the outcomes of 600 cases over 12 months to create a model for the viability of personal injury cases indeed trained on 200 years of supreme court records an ai is already better than many human experts at predicting scotus decisionsa consensus has emerged that ai will significantly disrupt the legal market ai will impact the availability of legal sector jobs the business models of many law firms and how inhouse counsel leverage technologyaccording to deloitte about 100000 legal sector jobs are likely to be automated in the next twenty years deloitte claims 39 of legal jobs can be automated mckinsey global institute estimates that 23 of a lawyers job could be automated some estimates suggest that adopting all legal technology including ai already available now would reduce lawyers hours by 13law firms are notoriously slow to adapt to new technologies enhancing efficiency is often seen as contrary to the economic goal of maximizing billable hours lawyers are also seen as being technophobichowever many law firms are trying to understand and use new legal technologies including ai according to the london times the vast majority of the uk’s top 100 law firms are either using artificial intelligence or assessing the technology firms adopting ai systems include latham watkins baker mckenzie slaughter may and singapores dentons rodyk davidsonron dolin a senior research fellow at harvard law schools center on the legal profession says that traditional law firm business models based on armies of first year associates racking up billable hours doing ma contract review are doomed by the advent of ai this isnt necessarily bad news for junior associatesor at least for the ones who still have jobsas many hated doing contract review in the first placefirms that fail to take advantage of aipowered efficiencies may lag in competing with those who doat least to the extent clients insist on fixedrate billingthus lawyers who understand technology and educate themselves about the latest legaltech developments may be of increasing value to their firmscorporate counsel have obvious reasons to adopt ai unlike attorneys in law firms corporate counsel have no incentive to maximize their hours indeed many lawyers go inhouse to improve their worklife balance which includes getting home at a reasonable hour theyre also often subject to strict budget and headcount constraints so they have to figure out how to get more done with limited resources ai helps inhouse lawyers get home earlier without increasing their departmental budgetsthe aba model rules of professional conduct model rules require that lawyers be competentand that they keep up with new technology as comment 8 statesat least 27 states have adopted some form of this model rule in january of 2017 florida became the first state to require technology training as part of its continuing legal education requirement other states seem likely to follow suit indeed failing to use commonly available technology like email and ediscovery software can be grounds for a malpractice claim or suspension by the barof course aipowered legal automation is not yet common but it soon will bespending on ai is expected to grow rapidlyfrom 8 billion in 2016 to 47 billion in 2020as ai is seen as reducing costs and increasing efficiency top mba programs already have courses on how

strategylike digital transformation before it establishing an enterprise artificial intelligence strategy is so new there is no playbook to crib from and even if a playbook did exist cios would still have to contend with the ongoing proliferation of technology meaning theyd have to customize their investments in ai and plans of action as ai tools evolvethe good news is that early adopters of ai arent operating in a vacuum they can rely on triedandtrue methods for building a new technology competency such as creating a center of excellence by establishing an artificial intelligence center of excellence coe companies can formalize their vision for and approach to aimilind wagle global cio at data center provider equinix inc is just beginning to make a case for an enterprise artificial intelligence strategy hes tapped members of his enterprise architecture team to keep tabs on the market and to uncover potential use cases and his team has also taken on a couple of projects to prove out the value of artificial intelligence investmentsone such project is an internal chatbot embedded into the corporate intranet that helps with things like employee training submitting expense reports and ordering new equipment we call it eva wagle said and its a conversational interface that lets the employee community get answers to a whole bunch of questions in a very contextrich mannerbut these efforts are new and while wagle is optimistic about where artificial intelligence is headed hes found that the technologies for use in the enterprise are still immature right now hes busy setting the groundworkas these technologies mature as we start to get more traction we are going to put some investment behind this in terms of resourcing and governance and create a team around it he said its like any other it capability that you launch if youre getting traction then theres a need to nurture enhance and support it and that will require investment and effortwagle doesnt call this team an artificial intelligence center of excellence but he could centers of excellence are often established to deal with new technologies skills or disciplines that dont fit neatly into the enterprise their aim is to provide governance and to prioritize efforts and they can help companies avoid classic pitfalls such as a tendency to focus on technology rather than use casefor most enterprises its very important that they start from the business perspective said bern elliot an analyst at gartner the artificial intelligence center of excellence is a way to help address the technical needs while also balancing it with the business needswalking the line between shiny new tech and what the business really needs is especially delicate for artificial intelligence its the advances in technology that are propelling the conversation in the first place encouraging companies to focus on possibility rather than concrete business problems but elliot said thats a big mistakeno one does anything with a neural network he said referring to the deep learning technique modeled after the hierarchical arrangement of neurons in biological sensory systems its really the applications of ai that make ai usefulrather than a single artificial intelligence center of excellence elliot teased out three strategic components to consider ai business innovation ai policies and governance and an ai skills center of excellence cios need to keep tabs on all three he saidthe business innovation piece is conducted in consultation with the lines of business to determine what applications and uses cases are most important and how they should be prioritizedthe ai policies and governance piece establishes guidelines on what to watch out for and best practices to follow you will be using data extensively in some cases he said in others you may be exposing the application to customers and you want to make sure its done in the right wayonce a project has been selected companies will need to get their skills house in order thats where the skills center of excellence comes into play the skills coe can include general skills such as data science and data analytics skills as well as aispecific skills such as deep neural networks and natural language understanding the artificial intelligence skills center of excellence is a way to help marshal and manage your skills he saidin many cases a skills team member wont be reassigned to the artificial intelligence skills center of excellence permanently instead team members will participate virtually tapped to help with a project based on how their particular skills applyfinally the skills coe doesnt have to be internal employees only in some cases these are difficult skills to develop elliot said or it may not be in a companys best interest to hire and train employees who leave a couple of years later because their market value is significantly higherthis is a perennial problem when a new technology comes along he said its why companies go to consultants because they get a skills solution provider who comes in and helps complete a project the company can maintain the relationship but they dont have to retain the staffmoiz kohari senior vice president and chief technology architect at state street corp in boston said being fully virtual is key to an artificial intelligence strategy in fact hes pushing back against an artificial intelligence center of excellence precisely because it conjures up the idea of a physical groupas a global company with talent scattered from china to boston and everywhere in between kohari said he finds the physicality of a traditional coe to be shortsighted we find it much more useful to be able to direct the right minds to the right problems he saidhis model is inspired in part by the open source community experts from around the world dont have to be working out of the same room on a project like the linux kernel a unixlike operating system the way it works is you have maintainers of certain areas of the project and you have contributors to that project he said contributors submit code to a githublike environment where its reviewed and accepted before its approved by project maintainers that kind of workflow exists at state streetby giving up the idea of a physical coe state street can think about leadership on a global rather than local scale we find that hiring the best minds wherever they may be is the most beneficial approach for us kohari saidthe company has identified specific technology areas it believes are critical to the financial institutions future including anomaly detection natural language processing and predictive analytics for each technology theyve sought to create a nucleus an expert or a couple of experts who can build a team and oversee projects that address business challenges in these areasthese nuclei are absolute rock stars in their fields im not just saying that kohari said these are guys who arent only contributing to projects but started or were founders of some of those projects he saidstate street supports their nuclei by embedding management talent onto the team to keep track of a projects progress the last thing you want to do is take one of the smartest people who works on anomaly libraries for anomaly detection and burden them with management challenges he saidnicole

confirm that i have read and accepted the terms of use and declaration of consentand artificial intelligence i came away wondering why theyre so far apartboth involve number crunching at their core but while bi is primarily retrospective in nature ai is all about the future the statistical analysis behind bi is primarily about basic counts in contrast with the ultrasophisticated machine learning and deep learning algorithms that underpin aibecause of these differences and the fact that ai as a useful tool is relatively new while bi is yesterdays news we treat the two disciplines as wholly separate during my time at the oreilly ai conference in new york in late june i heard not a single mention of bi conversely at dresner advisory services llcs real business intelligence conference held on the campus of mit in july ai was primarily used as a counterpoint to bi in discussions of the latters strong business value and high adoptionbut speaker mico yuk ceo of consultancy bi brainz in atlanta had an interesting idea im hoping that with more machine learning key performance indicators will grow and evolve she said im hoping we can work on metrics using data science and make kpis work for you rather than you working for themin her vision machine learning algorithms deployed in bi software will tell businesses whats interesting in their historical data right now analysts typically have to define metrics for bi tools to track its a manual process and it only makes visible data the company already knows is importantbut machine learningenabled bi could delve deeper into a business unknown unknowns finding insights in previously unexamined data taken a step further aipowered bi could take advantage of natural language generation capabilities to explain to the business what these insights mean and how they might act on themthis isnt exactly a revolutionary idea bi vendor sisense announced in april a data discovery component to its software that automatically reviews data and alerts users to new and potentially interesting features other vendors are also adding machine learning components to their software analyst firm gartner has been talking about smart data discovery since at least 2015 but it wasnt until this springs magic quadrant report on bi and analytics platforms that gartner declared smart data discovery the next disruptor in the bi software marketthere is some momentum around the idea of combining machine learning business intelligence and artificial intelligence but based on my reporting the idea seems to have seeped little into the general publics consciousness we still mostly see ai and bi as separate domainsthis has to change think of all the time aipowered bi platforms could free up for analysts who currently spend much of their time handling requests for reports they could move on to more effective data science and predictive analytics projects weve seen from companies like uber and google that smart approaches to machine learning can create entirely new profitable business models thats the kind of thing people with strong analytics skills should be spending their time onmaybe once the hype surrounding ai starts to wear off the differences between it and bi will seem smaller and the opportunity more obvious after all were already seeing ai having a big impact on crm hr and fintech software theres no

disaster or are humankind’s most prominent geeks false prophets of end timessurely creating standards for the nascent ai industry is warranted and will be increasingly important for say establishing the ethics of selfdriving cars but an imminent robot uprising is not a threat the reality is that ai research and development is tremendously complex even intellects like musk and hawking don’t necessarily have a solid understanding of it as such they fall onto specious assumptions drawn more from science fiction than the real worldof those who actually work in ai few are particularly worried about runaway superintelligence “the ai community as a whole is a long way away from building anything that could be a concern to the general public” says dileep george cofounder of vicarious a prominent ai firm yann lecun director of ai research at facebook and director of the new york university center for data research stresses that the creation of humanlevel ai is a difficult—if not hopeless—goal making superintelligence moot for the foreseeable futureai researchers are not however free from all anxieties “what people in my field do worry about is the fearmongering that is happening” says yoshua bengio head of the machine learning laboratory at the university of montreal along with confusing the public and potentially turning away investors and students bengio says “there are crazy people out there who believe these claims of extreme danger to humanity they might take people like us as targets” the most pressing threat related to ai in other words might be neither artificial nor intelligent and the most urgent task for the ai community then is addressing the branding challenge not the technological one says george “as researchers we have an obligation

intelligence', 'h2': 'sebastian ulbert', 'h5': 'artificial intelligence aiartificial general intelligence agiartificial superintelligence asi', 'p': 'coresystems is now part of sap3 april 2017 3 minwhat exactly is artificial intelligence and what is the difference between general intelligence and super intelligence can we expect benevolent robots to be walking amongst us in the near future40 years ago today science fiction’s most iconic film was released star wars gave us two of our most beloved onscreen robots though r2d2 and c3po were far more advanced than anything existing then and even now artificial intelligence was already well on its way when the film premiered in fact the father of ai had already designed a test to determine a machine’s intelligence back in 1950 the turing test created by mathematician and computer scientist alan turing asked a judge to field a series of questions to two participants one machine and one human based on the responses the judge would then determine the human responder the computer was deemed intelligent if it was able to fool the judge at least 50 percent of the timesimply put artificial intelligence refers to a machine’s ability to imitate human cognitive abilities like problem solving and learning these skills also require an understanding of language and speech and strategic thinking we already encounter numerous applications of artificial intelligence on a daily basis when we ask siri for directions when driving past google’s autonomous vehicles when we use selfparking or cruise control featureshowever inspired by film and literature many people are more familiar with the concept of artificial general intelligence agi computers would be equally intelligent to humans in every aspect these machines would be capable of performing the same kind of intellectual tasks that humans perform with the same level of success apple’s cofounder steve wozniak developed the coffee test as an indicator for agi during the test a robot has to enter an average home and attempt to make coffee this means finding all the tools figuring out how they operate and then performing the task a robot able to complete this test would be considered an example of agi think c3pobut what about hal 9000 the 2001 a space odyssey horror computer is also still currently the stuff of fiction this field of ai is called artificial superintelligence and it is also the field of research that stephen hawking has warned us about one of ai’s leading figures nick bostrom has defined superintelligence as “an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field including scientific creativity general wisdom and social skills” this slight or vast superiority to human intellect is disconcerting to scientists and laymen because its outcome is unknown a machine capable of constantly learning and improving itself could be unstoppablewhere exactly is ai headed some of the most exciting advancements in ai are a result of selflearning and analytics for examplea study published by nature outlined the work of a team of researchers on “simulated childhood” this is a robot’s ability to detect a malfunction and use a process of trial and error to determine the defect and repair it in a matter of minutes the robots tested could identify a problem and determine the best ways to fix itself the robots could repair 14 forms of damagein 2013 a computer had the intelligence level of a 4year old child in 2014 a computer was able to solve a mathematical problem so complex that the most intelligent human minds could not check for accuracy computer scientist and futurist ray kurzweil said that computer intelligence would reach human levels by 2029by analyzing data from over 100 million articles sgi altix supercomputer nautilus was able to predict the future the computer could assess tone and mood connect it to geographical locations and use that information to foresee internet entrepreneur kalev leetaru who fed the computer all the information considers it akin to weather forecasting “its never perfect but we can do better than random guessing”it is clear that ai has resulted in machines that are in many ways more capable than human minds however it will be a long time before they are able to surpass human intelligence in every regard and should this day come the brightest minds in the field are well aware of the risks of superintelligent computers and should be able to thwart any hal 9000’s before it’s too latefind out how to become an industry leader in

ever to being realised 2015 saw drones taking to the skies while back on the ground artificial intelligence programs are achieving aboveaverage scores on college entrance exams artificial intelligence or ai is the practice of making a machine behave in a practical responsive way its already changing our world and is by my reckoning the most fascinating field of technology right nowbut as one professor i spoke to for this story put it the audacity of the attempt to build an intelligent machine comes with a responsibility to know what were meddling with for everyone who ever thumbed through a copy of i robot mouth agape heres what you need to know about ai in the modern worldmention the phrase killer robot in conversation and youll almost certainly raise a smile your peers doubtless imagining a glowing blue humanoid cyborg sadly pondering what is love before its eyes turn red and it selfdestructs obliterating the northern hemisphereclick here for more stories in cnets most exciting tech seriesdeeply ingrained in modern pop culture is the notion that some manner of ai uprising is on the cards james camerons iconic image of a terminator stamping on a mound of human skulls is never far from any geeks thoughtsthat playful cinematic and deeply poetic cultural artifact belies the very real threat humanity faces however not from killer robots overthrowing their human masters but from intelligent robots following ordersthe immediate threat experts warn comes in the form of autonomous weapons military machines capable of killing without permission from a human from unmanned planes to missile defence systems to sentry robots weve already got military hardware that functions with very little input from a human mindgroups such as the campaign to stop killer robots say were inching ever closer to closing the loop and letting machines handle our killing for us a scenario thats legally pragmatically and of course ethically problematicthe less sensationally named future of life institute recently published an open letter signed by hundreds of ai researchers and famous tech personalities warning if any major military power pushes ahead with ai weapon development a global arms race is virtually inevitable and the endpoint of this technological trajectory is obvious autonomous weapons will become the kalashnikovs of tomorrowthe campaign to stop killer robots a coalition of more than 50 nongovernmental organisations claims its making progress towards a treaty one akin to the international agreement outlawing chemical weapons the un has already hosted discussions on the subject of autonomous murderbots one huge obstacle facing these groups however is that to rave about imminent robot slaughter makes you look like a crackpot whos watched the matrix one too many timeshumanity needs to revise its popcultureinstilled notion that robots becoming selfaware and robots wiping out humanity will occur simultaneously machines that become smart enough to ponder their own existence may certainly be a problem decades down the line but phenomenal advances in ai mean that robots that kill without even being programmed to understand the barest concept of mercy are uncomfortably closeartificial intelligence takes many forms and while weve successfully programmed machines to clean our floors set alarms on our phones park our cars and take out military installations from above the clouds things like introspection and selfawareness are proving a little toughertelling a joke making an ethical judgement deciding that you want to collaborate with some individuals and not others this rich texture of human life isnt there in our machines at all said sir nigel shadbolt professor of computer science at oxford universityfor decades humans have looked forward to the socalled singularity the moment of selfawareness that creates an explosion in selfimproving machine intelligence this will be triggered its presumed by the exponential growth of computing power coupled with advancing software complexityfuturist ray kurzweil predicted in a 2005 book that a model of human intelligence would be achieved as soon as the mid 2020s what appears to be the case now however is that the complexity of our own minds the key that gives rise to consciousness is a lot more well complicated than we imaginedthat spark of awareness in your head we dont know where that comes from shadbolt said the complexity we embody that allows consciousness to happen isnt just by the fact that weve got this kind of cortex this rational brain we have an endocrine system were emotional we have the threelayer brainwe are extraordinarily complex and we have only begun to unpack just a tiny amount of that at this pointits still the hard problem shadbolt said later joking when i ask what the biggest public misconception is concerning ai that its just 10 years down the roadthat sentiment is shared by murray shanahan professor of cognitive robotics at imperial college london who told me the media often gives the impression that humanlevel ai of the sort we see in scifi movies is just around the corner but its almost certainly decades awaytwo of the major problems shanahan explained are endowing computers and robots with a common sense understanding of the everyday world and endowing them with creativity by creativity i dont mean the sort of thing we see in the picassos or einsteins of the world but rather the sort of thing that every child is capable offrom the terminator series to movies such as i robot chappie ex machina and even short circuit the way we portray ai on screen has traditionally been humancentric we tend to imagine a being that essentially looks and acts a lot like a person as ai spreads into every aspect of our life we should be prepared to broaden our horizons when it comes to imagining the bounds and types of intelligence that can be valuable after all weve got plenty of humangrade intelligence alreadythe point cant be just to replicate ourselves shadbolt said weve got very interesting biological ways of doing that so why on earth would we want to do it in siliconfrom the humble roomba to googles animallike selfdriving car siri or neural networks that oversee data centres ai is branching out in ways we couldnt have imagined decades ago if you define intelligence in a way thats more machinecentric professor alan woodward told me last year in an interview on the fading relevance of the turing test youll find some very intelligent machines out there alreadythat diversity in the kinds of ai now emerging may in part come down to the breadth of disciplines currently investigating machine intelligence theres a broad range of subjects now that look at the problem shadbolt said psychologists look at it from a human context there are animal psychologists physiologists neuroscientists ai practitioners all looking at it with a different anglefundamentally well need an interdisciplinary approach so for me there isnt one single discipline that will have all the answersthats the face of modern ai taskcentric wildly diverse intelligent systems essentially mindless for now but busily changing every aspect of human life nonetheless whether its public transport or patrolling the skies the ai of today is nothing like the gloomy glowing cyborg we once pictured its

lists saving you from manually looking for materials relevant to the conversation ai coupled with a virtual voice assistant like amazons alexa for business microsofts cortana google assistant or apples siri could enable natural language data queries for example you could say hey cortana pull up the q4 sales figures and projections for q1 next year if deploying an ai engine to listen to discussions in a meeting or read textbased conversations in a team app the agent could then offer assistance such as would you like me to schedule a task for john to develop budget projections for the new marketing campaignrealtime language translation which enables global workgroups to communicate and collaborate in their native languages and receive native language meeting transcriptions efficient schedules such as calendar systems or meeting applications enabled to automatically schedule future calls based on a projects schedule and availability without individuals having to manually search calendars for availability or worse yet exchange emails to find an appropriate meeting time quicker feedback by integrating chatbots into team applications to enable native language collaboration capabilities such as polling team participants for a status update or providing alerts to team members when the ai engine detects an anomaly in a related business process for example a systems failure could trigger ai tools to create popup messages in the team apps or new conversation channels and it could automatically input relevant datathe ai application could recognize individuals as they enter a meeting room prompting the meeting system to say hi julie i see you have a 400 pm status meeting would you like me to start it this saves time starting audio video and web conferencing bridges as well as retrieving digital whiteboards and shared files it could take attendance by visually or audibly recognizing employees as they join meetings and the ai could use data analytics to help facilities and uc managers gain insight into how meeting spaces are being used how many people are in a typical meeting and how long they use the roomcompliance and security it leaders especially those in regulated industries are likely to be wary about ais access to corporate information and the way that information is stored within ai engines as ai platforms become targets for attack expect to pay closer attention to how that data is protected reliance on cloud the computing power required for ai as well as the need for rapid application evolution typically means that ai platforms are cloudbased and use microservicesbased architectures that leads to data security issues as well the need to ensure that data is stored in accordance with standards like the general data protection regulation business case many of the previously described scenarios are difficult to quantify for enterprises trying to determine return on investment vendors likely will integrate aidriven applications into their current offerings rather than sell separate tools requiring their own licenses or software acquisitions still enterprises will incur costs related to training and it

'h5': 'contact ussubscriptionscommercial', 'p': 'artificial intelligence throws up a range of legal issues says luis franco of pérezllorcaolga nikonovathe idea of artificial intelligence ‘ai’ has been around since the times of antiquity even if the actual term was coined centuries later at dartmouth college in 1956 certainly we find many examples of thinking machines in ancient myths and in more recent years the literature and film industries have recurrently drawn upon that idea to create all kinds of stories and ultimately that is how many people see ai as an idea bound up with the realm of myths and science fictionhowever this preconception may soon change considering some of the recent developments in this area selfparking cars are already available on the market and according to major car manufacturers’ expectations selfdriven cars will arrive in 5 to 10 years’ time unmanned aircrafts and drones are becoming increasingly common in many fields border control package delivery etc we also have several examples of programmes with certain learning capabilities web ads search engines like google search or apps like siri and viv which use a natural language user interface adapting to the users individual language usage and individual preferences with continuing use and returning individualized resultscertainly the opinion of a significant section of the scientific community seems to be that ai will arrive shortly considering that in the past few months several renowned scientists have emphasized the risks of ai and the need for worldwide regulation on the subject the best example of this is the open letter recently published by the future of life institute “fli” which has been signed by a number of respected scientists including elon musk cofounder of paypal tesla motors and spacex or preeminent astrophysicist dr stephen hawkinsthe letter includes a list of research priorities which put forward several interesting and complex questions requiring an adequate solution we do not presume to have any or all of the answers but we would like to outline some of the most complicated aspects and propose some additional questions to considershort term horizon autonomous systemsconsidering the short term research priorities set out in fli’s letter what we can hope to expect from ai in the near future are increasingly autonomous systems such as selfdriven cars autonomous trading systems more efficient information managing programmes fully automated factories etc from a legal perspective we would be interested in exploring one of its most fundamental aspects which is potential liability in the event of damages caused by an autonomous systemfli’s letter addresses this issue in connection with liability for accidents caused by selfdriven cars although this concern could be extended to drones and other automated vehiclesfirstly who exactly should be taking out the premiums of the obligatory insurance policies associated with the vehicle the ratio legis behind mandatory insurance policies is that a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous and thus its owner must guarantee cover for any damages caused by it however if control over the vehicle is taken from the owner and given to an autonomous system it could be argued that it should be its manufacturer who bears the cost of the insurance policy or perhaps that it should be shared between the manufacturer and the ownera different question would be the actual allocation of liability in the event of an accident assuming that all control over the vehicle is taken away from the driver for lack of a better word how could heshe be held liable for the damages caused in an accident thus we need to explore the potential liability of the manufacturerif the damages were caused due to a faulty design malfunction andor assembly of the vehicle the matter does not present any particular complexity as in such an event it is clear that the manufacturer should be held liablehowever liabilities cannot be so easily allocated if no malfunction is involved in the accident for example if a system which is working properly detects a potential risk but cannot react fast enough current legal doctrine would dictate that no liability should be allocated to the manufacturer if the system was working in accordance with current scientific knowledge and technology and had been approved by the relevant public authorityconsidering the above the standards set by the public authorities in order to approve any given autonomous system will have to be carefully measured in order to set these standards a consideration of paramount importance and great complexity is how a system should ponder the potential risk of causing injury to a person versus the risk of causing economic damagesobviously human life and health should always be prioritised over property damage thus when probabilities are levelled the system should avoid the chance of causing personal injury and assume the risk of causing economic damages however if the probability of causing personal injury is very small the answer might be different indeed if we took the avoidance of risk to humans to extremes we could reach a point where no system would operate since there would always be such a risk however there is a huge grey area in the middle where several factors should be considered in order to set boundaries which would constitute a sorites paradoxof course there are many other questions that autonomous systems will bring up from a legal perspective for example issues related to privacy and security of personal data can autonomous systems share personal data or labourrelated matterslong term sapient selfaware systemsin the long term the questions and challenges will become far more complex and challenging as they will exceed the boundaries of both computer science and laws and will enter into the territory of ethics philosophy and even religion similarly to other highly controversial fields of scientific investigation such as human cloning stem cell research or genetic engineeringif a truly sapient machine could ultimately be created which in view of fli’s letter seems conceivable it will likely be a turning point in human history the potential benefits and indeed risks are immense and a lot of them may probably be far beyond what we currently consider as even remotely possible as will be the questions that will need to be answeredindeed we may have to consider if such sapient machines should have a legal cybernetic personality and whether they could be held liable we may also have to ask ourselves if those machines can own property and have other civil rights or even if they can be actually owned or on the contrary if owning a truly sapient selfaware creature even if an artificial one would be tantamount to slaveryperhaps some of these ideas might seem farfetched and even somewhat shocking however rather than providing any answers these are merely questions that the legal community and other professionals should begin to think aboutnew questionsthe development of artificial intelligence which is likely to speed up in the near future will bring forth new and complex questions to which no legal system in the world has an answer it is therefore necessary for the legal community to begin to consider the answersluis franco is a

lawgeex a tel aviv legaltech startupwhats artificial intelligence ai and why should lawyers care about it on a practical level lawyers should be aware that software powered by ai already carries out legal tasks within a few years ai will be taking over or at least affecting a significant amount of work now done by lawyers thirtynine percent of inhouse counsel expect that ai will be commonplace in legal work within ten yearson a more philosophical level lawyers should understand that the decisions made by aipowered software will raise significant legal questions including those of tort liability and of criminal guilt for example if ai is controlling a driverless car and someones killed in an accident whos at faultwhile the philosophical questions are important to resolve this comment will focus on the practical issues to provide an overview of what ai is and how it will be used in the legal profession this comment addresses several questionslets start with a few definitionsartificial intelligence is the term used to describe how computers can perform tasks normally viewed as requiring human intelligence such as recognizing speech and objects making decisions based on data and translating languages ai mimics certain operations of the human mindmachine learning is an application of ai in which computers use algorithms rules embodied in software to learn from data and adapt with experiencea neural network is a computer that classifies information putting things into buckets based on their characteristics the hotdog identifying app from hbos silicon valley is an example of one application of this technologysome ai programs train themselves through trial and error for example using a technique called neuroevolution researchers at elon musks openai research center set up an algorithm with policies for getting high scores on atari videogames several hundred copies of these rules were created on different computers with random variations the computers then played the games to learn which policies were most effective and fed those results back into the system ai can also be used to build better ai google is building algorithms that analyze other algorithms to learn which methods are more successfulother ai programs need to be trained by humans feeding them data the ai then derives patterns and rules from that data ai programs trained through machine learning are wellsuited to solve classification problems this basically means calculating the probability that certain information is either of type a or type b for example determining whether a given bear is a panda or a koala is a classification problemthe training starts with showing the computer lots of samples of pandas and koalas these initial samples are called the training set and clearly identify which type of bear is being presented to the aithe ai builds a modela set of rulesto distinguish between pandas and koalas that model might be based on things like size coloring the shape of the ears and what the animal eats bamboo or eucalyptusafter training the ai can be tested with new pandas and koalas to see whether it classifies them correctly if it doesnt do very well the algorithm may need to be tweaked or the training set may need to be expanded to give the ai more data to crunchat this point in its development ai is good at finding items that meet humandefined criteria and detecting patterns in data in other words ai can figure out what makes a panda a panda and what distinguishes it from a koalawhich lets it find the pandas in a collection of random bears these are sometimes called searchandfind type tasksonce its identified something the ai can then apply humandefined rules and take actions in the case of legal work an ai can carry out tasks likeaccording to stefanie yuen thio joint managing partner and head of corporate at tsmp law corp in singapore legal work thats repetitive requiring minimal professional intervention or based on a template will become the sole province of software in addition she saysai can help consumers by providing a form of legal service to clients who might otherwise not be able to afford a lawyer the free service donotpay created by a 19yearold is an aipowered chatbot that lets users contest parking tickets in london and new york in its first 21 months it took on 250000 cases and won 160000 of them saving users more than 4 million worth of fines the same program is helping consumers file databreachrelated suits against equifax for up to 25000though it cant help them litigate their casesaccording to yuen thio ai cant yet replicate advocacy negotiation or structuring of complex deals the new york times suggested that tasks like advising clients writing briefs negotiating deals and appearing in court were beyond the reach of computerization at least for a while ai also isnt yet very good at the type of creative writing in a supreme court brief or a movie scriptlawyers are already using ai to do things like reviewing documents during litigation and due diligence analyzing contracts to determine whether they meet predetermined criteria performing legal research and predicting case outcomesdocument review for litigation involves the task of looking for relevant documentsfor example documents containing specific keywords or emails from ms x to mr y concerning topic z during march 2016 setting search parameters for document review doesnt require ai but using ai improves the speed accuracy and efficiency of document analysisfor example when lawyers using aipowered software for document review flag certain documents as relevant the ai learns what type of documents its supposed to be looking for hence it can more accurately identify other relevant documents this is called predictive coding predictive coding offers many advantages over oldschool manual document review among other things itpredictive coding has been widely accepted as a document review method by us courts since the 2012 decision in da silva moore v publicus groupeclients need to analyze contracts both in bulk and on an individual basisfor example analysis of all contracts a company has signed can identify risks anomalies future financial obligations renewal and expiration dates etc for companies with hundreds or thousands of contracts this can be a slow expensive laborintensive and errorprone process assuming the contracts arent already entered into a robust contract management system its also boring for the lawyers or others tasked with doing iton a daytoday basis lawyers review contracts make comments and redlines and advise clients on whether to sign contracts asis or try to negotiate better terms these contracts can range from simple eg ndas to complex a backlog of contracts to review can create a bottleneck that delays deals and the associated revenues lawyers especially inexperienced ones can miss important issues that can come back to bite their clients laterai can help with both bulk and individual contract reviewat jpmorgan an aipowered program called coin has been used since june 2017 to interpret commercial loan agreements work that previously took 360000 lawyerhours can now be done in seconds the bank is planning to use the technology for other types of legal documents as wellsome ai platforms such as the one provided by kira systems allow lawyers to identify extract and analyze business information contained in large volumes of contract data this is used to create contract summary charts for ma due diligencethe company i work for lawgeex uses ai to analyze contracts one at a time as part of a lawyers daily workflow to start with lawyers set up their lawgeex playbooks by selecting from a list of clauses and variations to require accept or reject for example a california governing law clause might be ok but genovian law isnt then when someone uploads a contract the ai scans it and determines what clauses and variations are present and missing the relevant language is highlighted and marked with a green thumbsup or a red thumbsdown based on the clients preset criteriainhouse lawyers use lawgeex to triage standard agreements like ndas contracts meeting predefined criteria can be preapproved for signature those that dont are kicked to the legal department for further review and revisionany lawyer whos ever done research using lexis or westlaw has used legal automation finding relevant cases in previous eras involving the laborious process of looking up headnote numbers and shepardizing in paper volumes but ai takes research to the next level for example ross intelligence uses the power of ibms watson supercomputer to find similar cases it can even respond to queries in plain english the power of aienabled research is striking using common research methods a bankruptcy lawyer found a case nearly identical to the one he was working on in 10 hours rosss ai found it almost instantlylawyers are often called upon to predict the future if i bring this case how likely is it that ill win and how much will it cost me should i settle this case or take a plea or take my chances at trial more experienced lawyers are often better at making accurate predictions because they have more years of data to work withhowever no lawyer has complete knowledge of all the relevant databecause ai can access more of the relevant data it can be better than lawyers at predicting the outcomes of legal disputes and proceedings and thus helping clients make decisions for example a london law firm used data on the outcomes of 600 cases over 12 months to create a model for the viability of personal injury cases indeed trained on 200 years of supreme court records an ai is already better than many human experts at predicting scotus decisionsa consensus has emerged that ai will significantly disrupt the legal market ai will impact the availability of legal sector jobs the business models of many law firms and how inhouse counsel leverage technologyaccording to deloitte about 100000 legal sector jobs are likely to be automated in the next twenty years deloitte claims 39 of legal jobs can be automated mckinsey global institute estimates that 23 of a lawyers job could be automated some estimates suggest that adopting all legal technology including ai already available now would reduce lawyers hours by 13law firms are notoriously slow to adapt to new technologies enhancing efficiency is often seen as contrary to the economic goal of maximizing billable hours lawyers are also seen as being technophobichowever many law firms are trying to understand and use new legal technologies including ai according to the london times the vast majority of the uk’s top 100 law firms are either using artificial intelligence or assessing the technology firms adopting ai systems include latham watkins baker mckenzie slaughter may and singapores dentons rodyk davidsonron dolin a senior research fellow at harvard law schools center on the legal profession says that traditional law firm business models based on armies of first year associates racking up billable hours doing ma contract review are doomed by the advent of ai this isnt necessarily bad news for junior associatesor at least for the ones who still have jobsas many hated doing contract review in the first placefirms that fail to take advantage of aipowered efficiencies may lag in competing with those who doat least to the extent clients insist on fixedrate billingthus lawyers who understand technology and educate themselves about the latest legaltech developments may be of increasing value to their firmscorporate counsel have obvious reasons to adopt ai unlike attorneys in law firms corporate counsel have no incentive to maximize their hours indeed many lawyers go inhouse to improve their worklife balance which includes getting home at a reasonable hour theyre also often subject to strict budget and headcount constraints so they have to figure out how to get more done with limited resources ai helps inhouse lawyers get home earlier without increasing their departmental budgetsthe aba model rules of professional conduct model rules require that lawyers be competentand that they keep up with new technology as comment 8 statesat least 27 states have adopted some form of this model rule in january of 2017 florida became the first state to require technology training as part of its continuing legal education requirement other states seem likely to follow suit indeed failing to use commonly available technology like email and ediscovery software can be grounds for a malpractice claim or suspension by the barof course aipowered legal automation is not yet common but it soon will bespending on ai is expected to grow rapidlyfrom 8 billion in 2016 to 47 billion in 2020as ai is seen as reducing costs and increasing efficiency top mba programs already have courses on how

have to contend with the ongoing proliferation of technology meaning theyd have to customize their investments in ai and plans of action as ai tools evolvethe good news is that early adopters of ai arent operating in a vacuum they can rely on triedandtrue methods for building a new technology competency such as creating a center of excellence by establishing an artificial intelligence center of excellence coe companies can formalize their vision for and approach to aimilind wagle global cio at data center provider equinix inc is just beginning to make a case for an enterprise artificial intelligence strategy hes tapped members of his enterprise architecture team to keep tabs on the market and to uncover potential use cases and his team has also taken on a couple of projects to prove out the value of artificial intelligence investmentsone such project is an internal chatbot embedded into the corporate intranet that helps with things like employee training submitting expense reports and ordering new equipment we call it eva wagle said and its a conversational interface that lets the employee community get answers to a whole bunch of questions in a very contextrich mannerbut these efforts are new and while wagle is optimistic about where artificial intelligence is headed hes found that the technologies for use in the enterprise are still immature right now hes busy setting the groundworkas these technologies mature as we start to get more traction we are going to put some investment behind this in terms of resourcing and governance and create a team around it he said its like any other it capability that you launch if youre getting traction then theres a need to nurture enhance and support it and that will require investment and effortwagle doesnt call this team an artificial intelligence center of excellence but he could centers of excellence are often established to deal with new technologies skills or disciplines that dont fit neatly into the enterprise their aim is to provide governance and to prioritize efforts and they can help companies avoid classic pitfalls such as a tendency to focus on technology rather than use casefor most enterprises its very important that they start from the business perspective said bern elliot an analyst at gartner the artificial intelligence center of excellence is a way to help address the technical needs while also balancing it with the business needswalking the line between shiny new tech and what the business really needs is especially delicate for artificial intelligence its the advances in technology that are propelling the conversation in the first place encouraging companies to focus on possibility rather than concrete business problems but elliot said thats a big mistakeno one does anything with a neural network he said referring to the deep learning technique modeled after the hierarchical arrangement of neurons in biological sensory systems its really the applications of ai that make ai usefulrather than a single artificial intelligence center of excellence elliot teased out three strategic components to consider ai business innovation ai policies and governance and an ai skills center of excellence cios need to keep tabs on all three he saidthe business innovation piece is conducted in consultation with the lines of business to determine what applications and uses cases are most important and how they should be prioritizedthe ai policies and governance piece establishes guidelines on what to watch out for and best practices to follow you will be using data extensively in some cases he said in others you may be exposing the application to customers and you want to make sure its done in the right wayonce a project has been selected companies will need to get their skills house in order thats where the skills center of excellence comes into play the skills coe can include general skills such as data science and data analytics skills as well as aispecific skills such as deep neural networks and natural language understanding the artificial intelligence skills center of excellence is a way to help marshal and manage your skills he saidin many cases a skills team member wont be reassigned to the artificial intelligence skills center of excellence permanently instead team members will participate virtually tapped to help with a project based on how their particular skills applyfinally the skills coe doesnt have to be internal employees only in some cases these are difficult skills to develop elliot said or it may not be in a companys best interest to hire and train employees who leave a couple of years later because their market value is significantly higherthis is a perennial problem when a new technology comes along he said its why companies go to consultants because they get a skills solution provider who comes in and helps complete a project the company can maintain the relationship but they dont have to retain the staffmoiz kohari senior vice president and chief technology architect at state street corp in boston said being fully virtual is key to an artificial intelligence strategy in fact hes pushing back against an artificial intelligence center of excellence precisely because it conjures up the idea of a physical groupas a global company with talent scattered from china to boston and everywhere in between kohari said he finds the physicality of a traditional coe to be shortsighted we find it much more useful to be able to direct the right minds to the right problems he saidhis model is inspired in part by the open source community experts from around the world dont have to be working out of the same room on a project like the linux kernel a unixlike operating system the way it works is you have maintainers of certain areas of the project and you have contributors to that project he said contributors submit code to a githublike environment where its reviewed and accepted before its approved by project maintainers that kind of workflow exists at state streetby giving up the idea of a physical coe state street can think about leadership on a global rather than local scale we find that hiring the best minds wherever they may be is the most beneficial approach for us kohari saidthe company has identified specific technology areas it believes are critical to the financial institutions future including anomaly detection natural language processing and predictive analytics for each technology theyve sought to create a nucleus an expert or a couple of experts who can build a team and oversee projects that address business challenges in these areasthese nuclei are absolute rock stars in their fields im not just saying that kohari said these are guys who arent only contributing to projects but started or were founders of some of those projects he saidstate street supports their nuclei by embedding management talent onto the team to keep track of a projects progress the last thing you want to do is take one of the smartest people who works on anomaly libraries for anomaly detection and burden them with management challenges he saidnicole

but while bi is primarily retrospective in nature ai is all about the future the statistical analysis behind bi is primarily about basic counts in contrast with the ultrasophisticated machine learning and deep learning algorithms that underpin aibecause of these differences and the fact that ai as a useful tool is relatively new while bi is yesterdays news we treat the two disciplines as wholly separate during my time at the oreilly ai conference in new york in late june i heard not a single mention of bi conversely at dresner advisory services llcs real business intelligence conference held on the campus of mit in july ai was primarily used as a counterpoint to bi in discussions of the latters strong business value and high adoptionbut speaker mico yuk ceo of consultancy bi brainz in atlanta had an interesting idea im hoping that with more machine learning key performance indicators will grow and evolve she said im hoping we can work on metrics using data science and make kpis work for you rather than you working for themin her vision machine learning algorithms deployed in bi software will tell businesses whats interesting in their historical data right now analysts typically have to define metrics for bi tools to track its a manual process and it only makes visible data the company already knows is importantbut machine learningenabled bi could delve deeper into a business unknown unknowns finding insights in previously unexamined data taken a step further aipowered bi could take advantage of natural language generation capabilities to explain to the business what these insights mean and how they might act on themthis isnt exactly a revolutionary idea bi vendor sisense announced in april a data discovery component to its software that automatically reviews data and alerts users to new and potentially interesting features other vendors are also adding machine learning components to their software analyst firm gartner has been talking about smart data discovery since at least 2015 but it wasnt until this springs magic quadrant report on bi and analytics platforms that gartner declared smart data discovery the next disruptor in the bi software marketthere is some momentum around the idea of combining machine learning business intelligence and artificial intelligence but based on my reporting the idea seems to have seeped little into the general publics consciousness we still mostly see ai and bi as separate domainsthis has to change think of all the time aipowered bi platforms could free up for analysts who currently spend much of their time handling requests for reports they could move on to more effective data science and predictive analytics projects weve seen from companies like uber and google that smart approaches to machine learning can create entirely new profitable business models thats the kind of thing people with strong analytics skills should be spending their time onmaybe once the hype surrounding ai starts to wear off the differences between it and bi will seem smaller and the opportunity more obvious after all were already seeing ai having a big impact on crm hr and fintech software theres no

intelligence', 'h2': 'sebastian ulbert', 'h5': 'artificial intelligence aiartificial general intelligence agiartificial superintelligence asi', 'p': 'coresystems is now part of sap3 april 2017 3 minwhat exactly is artificial intelligence and what is the difference between general intelligence and super intelligence can we expect benevolent robots to be walking amongst us in the near future40 years ago today science fiction’s most iconic film was released star wars gave us two of our most beloved onscreen robots though r2d2 and c3po were far more advanced than anything existing then and even now artificial intelligence was already well on its way when the film premiered in fact the father of ai had already designed a test to determine a machine’s intelligence back in 1950 the turing test created by mathematician and computer scientist alan turing asked a judge to field a series of questions to two participants one machine and one human based on the responses the judge would then determine the human responder the computer was deemed intelligent if it was able to fool the judge at least 50 percent of the timesimply put artificial intelligence refers to a machine’s ability to imitate human cognitive abilities like problem solving and learning these skills also require an understanding of language and speech and strategic thinking we already encounter numerous applications of artificial intelligence on a daily basis when we ask siri for directions when driving past google’s autonomous vehicles when we use selfparking or cruise control featureshowever inspired by film and literature many people are more familiar with the concept of artificial general intelligence agi computers would be equally intelligent to humans in every aspect these machines would be capable of performing the same kind of intellectual tasks that humans perform with the same level of success apple’s cofounder steve wozniak developed the coffee test as an indicator for agi during the test a robot has to enter an average home and attempt to make coffee this means finding all the tools figuring out how they operate and then performing the task a robot able to complete this test would be considered an example of agi think c3pobut what about hal 9000 the 2001 a space odyssey horror computer is also still currently the stuff of fiction this field of ai is called artificial superintelligence and it is also the field of research that stephen hawking has warned us about one of ai’s leading figures nick bostrom has defined superintelligence as “an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field including scientific creativity general wisdom and social skills” this slight or vast superiority to human intellect is disconcerting to scientists and laymen because its outcome is unknown a machine capable of constantly learning and improving itself could be unstoppablewhere exactly is ai headed some of the most exciting advancements in ai are a result of selflearning and analytics for examplea study published by nature outlined the work of a team of researchers on “simulated childhood” this is a robot’s ability to detect a malfunction and use a process of trial and error to determine the defect and repair it in a matter of minutes the robots tested could identify a problem and determine the best ways to fix itself the robots could repair 14 forms of damagein 2013 a computer had the intelligence level of a 4year old child in 2014 a computer was able to solve a mathematical problem so complex that the most intelligent human minds could not check for accuracy computer scientist and futurist ray kurzweil said that computer intelligence would reach human levels by 2029by analyzing data from over 100 million articles sgi altix supercomputer nautilus was able to predict the future the computer could assess tone and mood connect it to geographical locations and use that information to foresee internet entrepreneur kalev leetaru who fed the computer all the information considers it akin to weather forecasting “its never perfect but we can do better than random guessing”it is clear that ai has resulted in machines that are in many ways more capable than human minds however it will be a long time before they are able to surpass human intelligence in every regard and should this day come

ever to being realised 2015 saw drones taking to the skies while back on the ground artificial intelligence programs are achieving aboveaverage scores on college entrance exams artificial intelligence or ai is the practice of making a machine behave in a practical responsive way its already changing our world and is by my reckoning the most fascinating field of technology right nowbut as one professor i spoke to for this story put it the audacity of the attempt to build an intelligent machine comes with a responsibility to know what were meddling with for everyone who ever thumbed through a copy of i robot mouth agape heres what you need to know about ai in the modern worldmention the phrase killer robot in conversation and youll almost certainly raise a smile your peers doubtless imagining a glowing blue humanoid cyborg sadly pondering what is love before its eyes turn red and it selfdestructs obliterating the northern hemisphereclick here for more stories in cnets most exciting tech seriesdeeply ingrained in modern pop culture is the notion that some manner of ai uprising is on the cards james camerons iconic image of a terminator stamping on a mound of human skulls is never far from any geeks thoughtsthat playful cinematic and deeply poetic cultural artifact belies the very real threat humanity faces however not from killer robots overthrowing their human masters but from intelligent robots following ordersthe immediate threat experts warn comes in the form of autonomous weapons military machines capable of killing without permission from a human from unmanned planes to missile defence systems to sentry robots weve already got military hardware that functions with very little input from a human mindgroups such as the campaign to stop killer robots say were inching ever closer to closing the loop and letting machines handle our killing for us a scenario thats legally pragmatically and of course ethically problematicthe less sensationally named future of life institute recently published an open letter signed by hundreds of ai researchers and famous tech personalities warning if any major military power pushes ahead with ai weapon development a global arms race is virtually inevitable and the endpoint of this technological trajectory is obvious autonomous weapons will become the kalashnikovs of tomorrowthe campaign to stop killer robots a coalition of more than 50 nongovernmental organisations claims its making progress towards a treaty one akin to the international agreement outlawing chemical weapons the un has already hosted discussions on the subject of autonomous murderbots one huge obstacle facing these groups however is that to rave about imminent robot slaughter makes you look like a crackpot whos watched the matrix one too many timeshumanity needs to revise its popcultureinstilled notion that robots becoming selfaware and robots wiping out humanity will occur simultaneously machines that become smart enough to ponder their own existence may certainly be a problem decades down the line but phenomenal advances in ai mean that robots that kill without even being programmed to understand the barest concept of mercy are uncomfortably closeartificial intelligence takes many forms and while weve successfully programmed machines to clean our floors set alarms on our phones park our cars and take out military installations from above the clouds things like introspection and selfawareness are proving a little toughertelling a joke making an ethical judgement deciding that you want to collaborate with some individuals and not others this rich texture of human life isnt there in our machines at all said sir nigel shadbolt professor of computer science at oxford universityfor decades humans have looked forward to the socalled singularity the moment of selfawareness that creates an explosion in selfimproving machine intelligence this will be triggered its presumed by the exponential growth of computing power coupled with advancing software complexityfuturist ray kurzweil predicted in a 2005 book that a model of human intelligence would be achieved as soon as the mid 2020s what appears to be the case now however is that the complexity of our own minds the key that gives rise to consciousness is a lot more well complicated than we imaginedthat spark of awareness in your head we dont know where that comes from shadbolt said the complexity we embody that allows consciousness to happen isnt just by the fact that weve got this kind of cortex this rational brain we have an endocrine system were emotional we have the threelayer brainwe are extraordinarily complex and we have only begun to unpack just a tiny amount of that at this pointits still the hard problem shadbolt said later joking when i ask what the biggest public misconception is concerning ai that its just 10 years down the roadthat sentiment is shared by murray shanahan professor of cognitive robotics at imperial college london who told me the media often gives the impression that humanlevel ai of the sort we see in scifi movies is just around the corner but its almost certainly decades awaytwo of the major problems shanahan explained are endowing computers and robots with a common sense understanding of the everyday world and endowing them with creativity by creativity i dont mean the sort of thing we see in the picassos or einsteins of the world but rather the sort of thing that every child is capable offrom the terminator series to movies such as i robot chappie ex machina and even short circuit the way we portray ai on screen has traditionally been humancentric we tend to imagine a being that essentially looks and acts a lot like a person as ai spreads into every aspect of our life we should be prepared to broaden our horizons when it comes to imagining the bounds and types of intelligence that can be valuable after all weve got plenty of humangrade intelligence alreadythe point cant be just to replicate ourselves shadbolt said weve got very interesting biological ways of doing that so why on earth would we want to do it in siliconfrom the humble roomba to googles animallike selfdriving car siri or neural networks that oversee data centres ai is branching out in ways we couldnt have imagined decades ago if you define intelligence in a way thats more machinecentric professor alan woodward told me last year in an interview on the fading relevance of the turing test youll find some very intelligent machines out there alreadythat diversity in the kinds of ai now emerging may in part come down to the breadth of disciplines currently investigating machine intelligence theres a broad range of subjects now that look at the problem shadbolt said psychologists look at it from a human context there are animal psychologists physiologists neuroscientists ai practitioners all looking at it with a different anglefundamentally well need an interdisciplinary approach so for me there isnt one single discipline that will have all the answersthats the face of modern ai taskcentric wildly diverse intelligent systems essentially mindless for now but busily changing every aspect of human life nonetheless whether its public transport or patrolling the skies the ai of today is nothing like the gloomy glowing cyborg we once pictured its

describes computer programs ability to learn based on observation and past experience through machine learning thanks to the rapid advancement of computer processing power ai has gone from concept to practical technology and is now being developed to improve decisionmaking across industriesnearly 41 of enterprises plan to use ai in their uc applications by the end of 2019 according to nemertes 2018 unified communications and collaboration report the research also found a direct correlation between ai adoption and overall uc success in addition ai is a bellwether technology as companies seek to use it to gain competitive advantage improve customer engagement and streamline business processes in their digital transformation projectsthere are several potential benefits when ai is integrated into unified communications heres a look at a few of themability to improve interaction with data an aibased virtual assistant could organize the relevant information documents and other materials for

collaborative sessions include transferring information more easily among globally dispersed teams for example aidriven collaboration offers the followingbetter endpoint control ai integrated with inroom meeting systems could enable meetings to begin and end more efficientlydespite the rapid advancement of ai and strong demand for the technology enterprises still need to consider security concerns and appropriate use cases for their organizationsthe various uses of artificial intelligence in communication and collaboration tools are enabling uc vendors to become more competitive in their offerings this has created somewhat of an arms race as companies seek to rapidly develop their own uc capabilities or engage with partners microsoft is using its azure public cloud capabilities

lists saving you from manually looking for materials relevant to the conversation ai coupled with a virtual voice assistant like amazons alexa for business microsofts cortana google assistant or apples siri could enable natural language data queries for example you could say hey cortana pull up the q4 sales figures and projections for q1 next year if deploying an ai engine to listen to discussions in a meeting or read textbased conversations in a team app the agent could then offer assistance such as would you like me to schedule a task for john to develop budget projections for the new marketing campaignrealtime language translation which enables global workgroups to communicate and collaborate in their native languages and receive native language meeting transcriptions efficient schedules such as calendar systems or meeting applications enabled to automatically schedule future calls based on a projects schedule and availability without individuals having to manually search calendars for availability or worse yet exchange emails to find an appropriate meeting time quicker feedback by integrating chatbots into team applications to enable native language collaboration capabilities such as polling team participants for a status update or providing alerts to team members when the ai engine detects an anomaly in a related business process for example a systems failure could trigger ai tools to create popup messages in the team apps or new conversation channels and it could automatically input relevant datathe ai application could recognize individuals as they enter a meeting room prompting the meeting system to say hi julie i see you have a 400 pm status meeting would you like me to start it this saves time starting audio video and web conferencing bridges as well as retrieving digital whiteboards and shared files it could take attendance by visually or audibly recognizing employees as they join meetings and the ai could use data analytics to help facilities and uc managers gain insight into how meeting spaces are being used how many people are in a typical meeting and how long they use the roomcompliance and security it leaders especially those in regulated industries are likely to be wary about ais access to corporate information and the way that information is stored within ai engines as ai platforms become targets for attack expect to pay closer attention to how that data is protected reliance on cloud the computing power required for ai as well as the need for rapid application evolution typically means that ai platforms are cloudbased and use microservicesbased architectures that leads to data security issues as well the need to ensure that data is stored in accordance with standards like the general data protection regulation business case many of the previously described scenarios are difficult to quantify for enterprises trying to determine return on investment vendors likely will integrate aidriven applications into their current offerings rather than sell separate tools requiring their own licenses or software acquisitions still enterprises will incur costs related to training and it support that they will need to balance with measurable productivity gains and process improvements it leaders will want to ensure that they have the necessary visibility into business processes to

'contact ussubscriptionscommercial', 'p': 'artificial intelligence throws up a range of legal issues says luis franco of pérezllorcaolga nikonovathe idea of artificial intelligence ‘ai’ has been around since the times of antiquity even if the actual term was coined centuries later at dartmouth college in 1956 certainly we find many examples of thinking machines in ancient myths and in more recent years the literature and film industries have recurrently drawn upon that idea to create all kinds of stories and ultimately that is how many people see ai as an idea bound up with the realm of myths and science fictionhowever this preconception may soon change considering some of the recent developments in this area selfparking cars are already available on the market and according to major car manufacturers’ expectations selfdriven cars will arrive in 5 to 10 years’ time unmanned aircrafts and drones are becoming increasingly common in many fields border control package delivery etc we also have several examples of programmes with certain learning capabilities web ads search engines like google search or apps like siri and viv which use a natural language user interface adapting to the users individual language usage and individual preferences with continuing use and returning individualized resultscertainly the opinion of a significant section of the scientific community seems to be that ai will arrive shortly considering that in the past few months several renowned scientists have emphasized the risks of ai and the need for worldwide regulation on the subject the best example of this is the open letter recently published by the future of life institute “fli” which has been signed by a number of respected scientists including elon musk cofounder of paypal tesla motors and spacex or preeminent astrophysicist dr stephen hawkinsthe letter includes a list of research priorities which put forward several interesting and complex questions requiring an adequate solution we do not presume to have any or all of the answers but we would like to outline some of the most complicated aspects and propose some additional questions to considershort term horizon autonomous systemsconsidering the short term research priorities set out in fli’s letter what we can hope to expect from ai in the near future are increasingly autonomous systems such as selfdriven cars autonomous trading systems more efficient information managing programmes fully automated factories etc from a legal perspective we would be interested in exploring one of its most fundamental aspects which is potential liability in the event of damages caused by an autonomous systemfli’s letter addresses this issue in connection with liability for accidents caused by selfdriven cars although this concern could be extended to drones and other automated vehiclesfirstly who exactly should be taking out the premiums of the obligatory insurance policies associated with the vehicle the ratio legis behind mandatory insurance policies is that a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous and thus its owner must guarantee cover for any damages caused by it however if control over the vehicle is taken from the owner and given to an autonomous system it could be argued that it should be its manufacturer who bears the cost of the insurance policy or perhaps that it should be shared between the manufacturer and the ownera different question would be the actual allocation of liability in the event of an accident assuming that all control over the vehicle is taken away from the driver for lack of a better word how could heshe be held liable for the damages caused in an accident thus we need to explore the potential liability of the manufacturerif the damages were caused due to a faulty design malfunction andor assembly of the vehicle the matter does not present any particular complexity as in such an event it is clear that the manufacturer should be held liablehowever liabilities cannot be so easily allocated if no malfunction is involved in the accident for example if a system which is working properly detects a potential risk but cannot react fast enough current legal doctrine would dictate that no liability should be allocated to the manufacturer if the system was working in accordance with current scientific knowledge and technology and had been approved by the relevant public authorityconsidering the above the standards set by the public authorities in order to approve any given autonomous system will have to be carefully measured in order to set these standards a consideration of paramount importance and great complexity is how a system should ponder the potential risk of causing injury to a person versus the risk of causing economic damagesobviously human life and health should always be prioritised over property damage thus when probabilities are levelled the system should avoid the chance of causing personal injury and assume the risk of causing economic damages however if the probability of causing personal injury is very small the answer might be different indeed if we took the avoidance of risk to humans to extremes we could reach a point where no system would operate since there would always be such a risk however there is a huge grey area in the middle where several factors should be considered in order to set boundaries which would constitute a sorites paradoxof course there are many other questions that autonomous systems will bring up from a legal perspective for example issues related to privacy and security of personal data can autonomous systems share personal data or labourrelated matterslong term sapient selfaware systemsin the long term the questions and challenges will become far more complex and challenging as they will exceed the boundaries of both computer science and laws and will enter into the territory of ethics philosophy and even religion similarly to other highly controversial fields of scientific investigation such as human cloning stem cell research or genetic engineeringif a truly sapient machine could ultimately be created which in view of fli’s letter seems conceivable it will likely be a turning point in human history the potential benefits and indeed risks are immense and a lot of them may probably be far beyond what we currently consider as even remotely possible as will be the questions that will need to be answeredindeed we may have to consider if such sapient machines should have a legal cybernetic personality and whether they could be held liable we may also have to ask ourselves if those machines can own property and have other civil rights or even if they can be actually owned or on the contrary if owning a truly sapient selfaware creature even if an artificial one would be tantamount to slaveryperhaps some of these ideas might seem farfetched and even somewhat shocking however rather than providing any answers these are merely questions that the legal community and other professionals should begin to think aboutnew questionsthe development of artificial intelligence which is likely to speed up in the near future will bring forth new and complex questions to which no legal system in the world has an answer it is therefore necessary for the legal community to begin to consider the answersluis franco is a

lawgeex a tel aviv legaltech startupwhats artificial intelligence ai and why should lawyers care about it on a practical level lawyers should be aware that software powered by ai already carries out legal tasks within a few years ai will be taking over or at least affecting a significant amount of work now done by lawyers thirtynine percent of inhouse counsel expect that ai will be commonplace in legal work within ten yearson a more philosophical level lawyers should understand that the decisions made by aipowered software will raise significant legal questions including those of tort liability and of criminal guilt for example if ai is controlling a driverless car and someones killed in an accident whos at faultwhile the philosophical questions are important to resolve this comment will focus on the practical issues to provide an overview of what ai is and how it will be used in the legal profession this comment addresses several questionslets start with a few definitionsartificial intelligence is the term used to describe how computers can perform tasks normally viewed as requiring human intelligence such as recognizing speech and objects making decisions based on data and translating languages ai mimics certain operations of the human mindmachine learning is an application of ai in which computers use algorithms rules embodied in software to learn from data and adapt with experiencea neural network is a computer that classifies information putting things into buckets based on their characteristics the hotdog identifying app from hbos silicon valley is an example of one application of this technologysome ai programs train themselves through trial and error for example using a technique called neuroevolution researchers at elon musks openai research center set up an algorithm with policies for getting high scores on atari videogames several hundred copies of these rules were created on different computers with random variations the computers then played the games to learn which policies were most effective and fed those results back into the system ai can also be used to build better ai google is building algorithms that analyze other algorithms to learn which methods are more successfulother ai programs need to be trained by humans feeding them data the ai then derives patterns and rules from that data ai programs trained through machine learning are wellsuited to solve classification problems this basically means calculating the probability that certain information is either of type a or type b for example determining whether a given bear is a panda or a koala is a classification problemthe training starts with showing the computer lots of samples of pandas and koalas these initial samples are called the training set and clearly identify which type of bear is being presented to the aithe ai builds a modela set of rulesto distinguish between pandas and koalas that model might be based on things like size coloring the shape of the ears and what the animal eats bamboo or eucalyptusafter training the ai can be tested with new pandas and koalas to see whether it classifies them correctly if it doesnt do very well the algorithm may need to be tweaked or the training set may need to be expanded to give the ai more data to crunchat this point in its development ai is good at finding items that meet humandefined criteria and detecting patterns in data in other words ai can figure out what makes a panda a panda and what distinguishes it from a koalawhich lets it find the pandas in a collection of random bears these are sometimes called searchandfind type tasksonce its identified something the ai can then apply humandefined rules and take actions in the case of legal work an ai can carry out tasks likeaccording to stefanie yuen thio joint managing partner and head of corporate at tsmp law corp in singapore legal work thats repetitive requiring minimal professional intervention or based on a template will become the sole province of software in addition she saysai can help consumers by providing a form of legal service to clients who might otherwise not be able to afford a lawyer the free service donotpay created by a 19yearold is an aipowered chatbot that lets users contest parking tickets in london and new york in its first 21 months it took on 250000 cases and won 160000 of them saving users more than 4 million worth of fines the same program is helping consumers file databreachrelated suits against equifax for up to 25000though it cant help them litigate their casesaccording to yuen thio ai cant yet replicate advocacy negotiation or structuring of complex deals the new york times suggested that tasks like advising clients writing briefs negotiating deals and appearing in court were beyond the reach of computerization at least for a while ai also isnt yet very good at the type of creative writing in a supreme court brief or a movie scriptlawyers are already using ai to do things like reviewing documents during litigation and due diligence analyzing contracts to determine whether they meet predetermined criteria performing legal research and predicting case outcomesdocument review for litigation involves the task of looking for relevant documentsfor example documents containing specific keywords or emails from ms x to mr y concerning topic z during march 2016 setting search parameters for document review doesnt require ai but using ai improves the speed accuracy and efficiency of document analysisfor example when lawyers using aipowered software for document review flag certain documents as relevant the ai learns what type of documents its supposed to be looking for hence it can more accurately identify other relevant documents this is called predictive coding predictive coding offers many advantages over oldschool manual document review among other things itpredictive coding has been widely accepted as a document review method by us courts since the 2012 decision in da silva moore v publicus groupeclients need to analyze contracts both in bulk and on an individual basisfor example analysis of all contracts a company has signed can identify risks anomalies future financial obligations renewal and expiration dates etc for companies with hundreds or thousands of contracts this can be a slow expensive laborintensive and errorprone process assuming the contracts arent already entered into a robust contract management system its also boring for the lawyers or others tasked with doing iton a daytoday basis lawyers review contracts make comments and redlines and advise clients on whether to sign contracts asis or try to negotiate better terms these contracts can range from simple eg ndas to complex a backlog of contracts to review can create a bottleneck that delays deals and the associated revenues lawyers especially inexperienced ones can miss important issues that can come back to bite their clients laterai can help with both bulk and individual contract reviewat jpmorgan an aipowered program called coin has been used since june 2017 to interpret commercial loan agreements work that previously took 360000 lawyerhours can now be done in seconds the bank is planning to use the technology for other types of legal documents as wellsome ai platforms such as the one provided by kira systems allow lawyers to identify extract and analyze business information contained in large volumes of contract data this is used to create contract summary charts for ma due diligencethe company i work for lawgeex uses ai to analyze contracts one at a time as part of a lawyers daily workflow to start with lawyers set up their lawgeex playbooks by selecting from a list of clauses and variations to require accept or reject for example a california governing law clause might be ok but genovian law isnt then when someone uploads a contract the ai scans it and determines what clauses and variations are present and missing the relevant language is highlighted and marked with a green thumbsup or a red thumbsdown based on the clients preset criteriainhouse lawyers use lawgeex to triage standard agreements like ndas contracts meeting predefined criteria can be preapproved for signature those that dont are kicked to the legal department for further review and revisionany lawyer whos ever done research using lexis or westlaw has used legal automation finding relevant cases in previous eras involving the laborious process of looking up headnote numbers and shepardizing in paper volumes but ai takes research to the next level for example ross intelligence uses the power of ibms watson supercomputer to find similar cases it can even respond to queries in plain english the power of aienabled research is striking using common research methods a bankruptcy lawyer found a case nearly identical to the one he was working on in 10 hours rosss ai found it almost instantlylawyers are often called upon to predict the future if i bring this case how likely is it that ill win and how much will it cost me should i settle this case or take a plea or take my chances at trial more experienced lawyers are often better at making accurate predictions because they have more years of data to work withhowever no lawyer has complete knowledge of all the relevant databecause ai can access more of the relevant data it can be better than lawyers at predicting the outcomes of legal disputes and proceedings and thus helping clients make decisions for example a london law firm used data on the outcomes of 600 cases over 12 months to create a model for the viability of personal injury cases indeed trained on 200 years of supreme court records an ai is already better than many human experts at predicting scotus decisionsa consensus has emerged that ai will significantly disrupt the legal market ai will impact the availability of legal sector jobs the business models of many law firms and how inhouse counsel leverage technologyaccording to deloitte about 100000 legal sector jobs are likely to be automated in the next twenty years deloitte claims 39 of legal jobs can be automated mckinsey global institute estimates that 23 of a lawyers job could be automated some estimates suggest that adopting all legal technology including ai already available now would reduce lawyers hours by 13law firms are notoriously slow to adapt to new technologies enhancing efficiency is often seen as contrary to the economic goal of maximizing billable hours lawyers are also seen as being technophobichowever many law firms are trying to understand and use new legal technologies including ai according to the london times the vast majority of the uk’s top 100 law firms are either using artificial intelligence or assessing the technology firms adopting ai systems include latham watkins baker mckenzie slaughter may and singapores dentons rodyk davidsonron dolin a senior research fellow at harvard law schools center on the legal profession says that traditional law firm business models based on armies of first year associates racking up billable hours doing ma contract review are doomed by the advent of ai this isnt necessarily bad news for junior associatesor at least for the ones who still have jobsas many hated doing contract review in the first placefirms that fail to take advantage of aipowered efficiencies may lag in competing with those who doat least to the extent clients insist on fixedrate billingthus lawyers who understand technology and educate themselves about the latest legaltech developments may be of increasing value to their firmscorporate counsel have obvious reasons to adopt ai unlike attorneys in law firms corporate counsel have no incentive to maximize their hours indeed many lawyers go inhouse to improve their worklife balance which includes getting home at a reasonable hour theyre also often subject to strict budget and headcount constraints so they have to figure out how to get more done with limited resources ai helps inhouse lawyers get home earlier without increasing their departmental budgetsthe aba model rules of professional conduct model rules require that lawyers be competentand that they keep up with new technology as comment 8 statesat least 27 states have adopted some form of this model rule in january of 2017 florida became the first state to require technology training as part of its continuing legal education requirement other states seem likely to follow suit indeed failing to use commonly available technology like email and ediscovery software can be grounds for a malpractice claim or suspension by the barof course aipowered legal automation is not yet common but it soon will bespending on ai is expected to grow rapidlyfrom 8 billion in 2016 to 47 billion in 2020as ai is seen as reducing costs and increasing efficiency top mba programs already have courses on how

strategylike digital transformation before it establishing an enterprise artificial intelligence strategy is so new there is no playbook to crib from and even if a playbook did exist cios would still have to contend with the ongoing proliferation of technology meaning theyd have to customize their investments in ai and plans of action as ai tools evolvethe good news is that early adopters of ai arent operating in a vacuum they can rely on triedandtrue methods for building a new technology competency such as creating a center of excellence by establishing an artificial intelligence center of excellence coe companies can formalize their vision for and approach to aimilind wagle global cio at data center provider equinix inc is just beginning to make a case for an enterprise artificial intelligence strategy hes tapped members of his enterprise architecture team to keep tabs on the market and to uncover potential use cases and his team has also taken on a couple of projects to prove out the value of artificial intelligence investmentsone such project is an internal chatbot embedded into the corporate intranet that helps with things like employee training submitting expense reports and ordering new equipment we call it eva wagle said and its a conversational interface that lets the employee community get answers to a whole bunch of questions in a very contextrich mannerbut these efforts are new and while wagle is optimistic about where artificial intelligence is headed hes found that the technologies for use in the enterprise are still immature right now hes busy setting the groundworkas these technologies mature as we start to get more traction we are going to put some investment behind this in terms of resourcing and governance and create a team around it he said its like any other it capability that you launch if youre getting traction then theres a need to nurture enhance and support it and that will require investment and effortwagle doesnt call this team an artificial intelligence center of excellence but he could centers of excellence are often established to deal with new technologies skills or disciplines that dont fit neatly into the enterprise their aim is to provide governance and to prioritize efforts and they can help companies avoid classic pitfalls such as a tendency to focus on technology rather than use casefor most enterprises its very important that they start from the business perspective said bern elliot an analyst at gartner the artificial intelligence center of excellence is a way to help address the technical needs while also balancing it with the business needswalking the line between shiny new tech and what the business really needs is especially delicate for artificial intelligence its the advances in technology that are propelling the conversation in the first place encouraging companies to focus on possibility rather than concrete business problems but elliot said thats a big mistakeno one does anything with a neural network he said referring to the deep learning technique modeled after the hierarchical arrangement of neurons in biological sensory systems its really the applications of ai that make ai usefulrather than a single artificial intelligence center of excellence elliot teased out three strategic components to consider ai business innovation ai policies and governance and an ai skills center of excellence cios need to keep tabs on all three he saidthe business innovation piece is conducted in consultation with the lines of business to determine what applications and uses cases are most important and how they should be prioritizedthe ai policies and governance piece establishes guidelines on what to watch out for and best practices to follow you will be using data extensively in some cases he said in others you may be exposing the application to customers and you want to make sure its done in the right wayonce a project has been selected companies will need to get their skills house in order thats where the skills center of excellence comes into play the skills coe can include general skills such as data science and data analytics skills as well as aispecific skills such as deep neural networks and natural language understanding the artificial intelligence skills center of excellence is a way to help marshal and manage your skills he saidin many cases a skills team member wont be reassigned to the artificial intelligence skills center of excellence permanently instead team members will participate virtually tapped to help with a project based on how their particular skills applyfinally the skills coe doesnt have to be internal employees only in some cases these are difficult skills to develop elliot said or it may not be in a companys best interest to hire and train employees who leave a couple of years later because their market value is significantly higherthis is a perennial problem when a new technology comes along he said its why companies go to consultants because they get a skills solution provider who comes in and helps complete a project the company can maintain the relationship but they dont have to retain the staffmoiz kohari senior vice president and chief technology architect at state street corp in boston said being fully virtual is key to an artificial intelligence strategy in fact hes pushing back against an artificial intelligence center of excellence precisely because it conjures up the idea of a physical groupas a global company with talent scattered from china to boston and everywhere in between kohari said he finds the physicality of a traditional coe to be shortsighted we find it much more useful to be able to direct the right minds to the right problems he saidhis model is inspired in part by the open source community experts from around the world dont have to be working out of the same room on a project like the linux kernel a unixlike operating system the way it works is you have maintainers of certain areas of the project and you have contributors to that project he said contributors submit code to a githublike environment where its reviewed and accepted before its approved by project maintainers that kind of workflow exists at state streetby giving up the idea of a physical coe state street can think about leadership on a global rather than local scale we find that hiring the best minds wherever they may be is the most beneficial approach for us kohari saidthe company has identified specific technology areas it believes are critical to the financial institutions future including anomaly detection natural language processing and predictive analytics for each technology theyve sought to create a nucleus an expert or a couple of experts who can build a team and oversee projects that address business challenges in these areasthese nuclei are absolute rock stars in their fields im not just saying that kohari said these are guys who arent only contributing to projects but started or were founders of some of those projects he saidstate street supports their nuclei by embedding management talent onto the team to keep track of a projects progress the last thing you want to do is take one of the smartest people who works on anomaly libraries for anomaly detection and burden them with management challenges he saidnicole

a business unknown unknowns finding insights in previously unexamined data taken a step further aipowered bi could take advantage of natural language generation capabilities to explain to the business what these insights mean and how they might act on themthis isnt exactly a revolutionary idea bi vendor sisense announced in april a data discovery component to its software that automatically reviews data and alerts users to new and potentially interesting features other vendors are also adding machine learning components to their software analyst firm gartner has been talking about smart data discovery since at least 2015 but it wasnt until this springs magic quadrant report on bi and analytics platforms that gartner declared smart data discovery the next disruptor in the bi software marketthere is some momentum around the idea of combining machine learning business intelligence and artificial intelligence but based on my reporting the idea seems to have seeped little into the general publics consciousness we still mostly see ai and bi as separate domainsthis has to change think of all the time aipowered bi platforms could free up for analysts who currently spend much of their time handling requests for reports they could move on to more effective data science and predictive analytics projects weve seen from companies like uber and google that smart approaches to machine learning can create entirely new profitable business models thats the kind of thing people with strong analytics skills should be spending their time onmaybe once the hype surrounding ai starts to wear off the differences between it and bi will seem smaller and the opportunity more obvious after all were already seeing ai having a big impact on crm hr and fintech software theres no

intelligence', 'h2': 'sebastian ulbert', 'h5': 'artificial intelligence aiartificial general intelligence agiartificial superintelligence asi', 'p': 'coresystems is now part of sap3 april 2017 3 minwhat exactly is artificial intelligence and what is the difference between general intelligence and super intelligence can we expect benevolent robots to be walking amongst us in the near future40 years ago today science fiction’s most iconic film was released star wars gave us two of our most beloved onscreen robots though r2d2 and c3po were far more advanced than anything existing then and even now artificial intelligence was already well on its way when the film premiered in fact the father of ai had already designed a test to determine a machine’s intelligence back in 1950 the turing test created by mathematician and computer scientist alan turing asked a judge to field a series of questions to two participants one machine and one human based on the responses the judge would then determine the human responder the computer was deemed intelligent if it was able to fool the judge at least 50 percent of the timesimply put artificial intelligence refers to a machine’s ability to imitate human cognitive abilities like problem solving and learning these skills also require an understanding of language and speech and strategic thinking we already encounter numerous applications of artificial intelligence on a daily basis when we ask siri for directions when driving past google’s autonomous vehicles when we use selfparking or cruise control featureshowever inspired by film and literature many people are more familiar with the concept of artificial general intelligence agi computers would be equally intelligent to humans in every aspect these machines would be capable of performing the same kind of intellectual tasks that humans perform with the same level of success apple’s cofounder steve wozniak developed the coffee test as an indicator for agi during the test a robot has to enter an average home and attempt to make coffee this means finding all the tools figuring out how they operate and then performing the task a robot able to complete this test would be considered an example of agi think c3pobut what about hal 9000 the 2001 a space odyssey horror computer is also still currently the stuff of fiction this field of ai is called artificial superintelligence and it is also the field of research that stephen hawking has warned us about one of ai’s leading figures nick bostrom has defined superintelligence as “an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field including scientific creativity general wisdom and social skills” this slight or vast superiority to human intellect is disconcerting to scientists and laymen because its outcome is unknown a machine capable of constantly learning and improving itself could be unstoppablewhere exactly is ai headed some of the most exciting advancements in ai are a result of selflearning and analytics for examplea study published by nature outlined the work of a team of researchers on “simulated childhood” this is a robot’s ability to detect a malfunction and use a process of trial and error to determine the defect and repair it in a matter of minutes the robots tested could identify a problem and determine the best ways to fix itself the robots could repair 14 forms of damagein 2013 a computer had the intelligence level of a 4year old child in 2014 a computer was able to solve a mathematical problem so complex that the most intelligent human minds could not check for accuracy computer scientist and futurist ray kurzweil said that computer intelligence would reach human levels by 2029by analyzing data from over 100 million articles sgi altix supercomputer nautilus was able to predict the future the computer could assess tone and mood connect it to geographical locations and use that information to foresee internet entrepreneur kalev leetaru who fed the computer all the information considers it akin to weather forecasting “its never perfect but we can do better than random guessing”it is clear that ai has resulted in machines that are in many ways more capable than human minds however it will be a long time before they are able to surpass human intelligence in every regard and should this day come

future of life institute recently published an open letter signed by hundreds of ai researchers and famous tech personalities warning if any major military power pushes ahead with ai weapon development a global arms race is virtually inevitable and the endpoint of this technological trajectory is obvious autonomous weapons will become the kalashnikovs of tomorrowthe campaign to stop killer robots a coalition of more than 50 nongovernmental organisations claims its making progress towards a treaty one akin to the international agreement outlawing chemical weapons the un has already hosted discussions on the subject of autonomous murderbots one huge obstacle facing these groups however is that to rave about imminent robot slaughter makes you look like a crackpot whos watched the matrix one too many timeshumanity needs to revise its popcultureinstilled notion that robots becoming selfaware and robots wiping out humanity will occur simultaneously machines that become smart enough to ponder their own existence may certainly be a problem decades down the line but phenomenal advances in ai mean that robots that kill without even being programmed to understand the barest concept of mercy are uncomfortably closeartificial intelligence takes many forms and while weve successfully programmed machines to clean our floors set alarms on our phones park our cars and take out military installations from above the clouds things like introspection and selfawareness are proving a little toughertelling a joke making an ethical judgement deciding that you want to collaborate with some individuals and not others this rich texture of human life isnt there in our machines at all said sir nigel shadbolt professor of computer science at oxford universityfor decades humans have looked forward to the socalled singularity the moment of selfawareness that creates an explosion in selfimproving machine intelligence this will be triggered its presumed by the exponential growth of computing power coupled with advancing software complexityfuturist ray kurzweil predicted in a 2005 book that a model of human intelligence would be achieved as soon as the mid 2020s what appears to be the case now however is that the complexity of our own minds the key that gives rise to consciousness is a lot more well complicated than we imaginedthat spark of awareness in your head we dont know where that comes from shadbolt said the complexity we embody that allows consciousness to happen isnt just by the fact that weve got this kind of cortex this rational brain we have an endocrine system were emotional we have the threelayer brainwe are extraordinarily complex and we have only begun to unpack just a tiny amount of that at this pointits still the hard problem shadbolt said later joking when i ask what the biggest public misconception is concerning ai that its just 10 years down the roadthat sentiment is shared by murray shanahan professor of cognitive robotics at imperial college london who told me the media often gives the impression that humanlevel ai of the sort we see in scifi movies is just around the corner but its almost certainly decades awaytwo of the major problems shanahan explained are endowing computers and robots with a common sense understanding of the everyday world and endowing them with creativity by creativity i dont mean the sort of thing we see in the picassos or einsteins of the world but rather the sort of thing that every child is capable offrom the terminator series to movies such as i robot chappie ex machina and even short circuit the way we portray ai on screen has traditionally been humancentric we tend to imagine a being that essentially looks and acts a lot like a person as ai spreads into every aspect of our life we should be prepared to broaden our horizons when it comes to imagining the bounds and types of intelligence that can be valuable after all weve got plenty of humangrade intelligence alreadythe point cant be just to replicate ourselves shadbolt said weve got very interesting biological ways of doing that so why on earth would we want to do it in siliconfrom the humble roomba to googles animallike selfdriving car siri or neural networks that oversee data centres ai is branching out in ways we couldnt have imagined decades ago if you define intelligence in a way thats more machinecentric professor alan woodward told me last year in an interview on the fading relevance of the turing test youll find some very intelligent machines out there alreadythat diversity in the kinds of ai now emerging may in part come down to the breadth of disciplines currently investigating machine intelligence theres a broad range of subjects now that look at the problem shadbolt said psychologists look at it from a human context there are animal psychologists physiologists neuroscientists ai practitioners all looking at it with a different anglefundamentally well need an interdisciplinary approach so for me there isnt one single discipline that will have all the answersthats the face of modern ai taskcentric wildly diverse intelligent systems essentially mindless for now but busily changing every aspect of human life nonetheless whether its public transport or patrolling the skies the ai of today is nothing like the gloomy glowing cyborg we once pictured its weirder more fascinating more surprising its better than we imaginedfirst black hole image revealed and its the eye of sauron the event horizon telescope captures one of the most powerful objects in

materials relevant to the conversation ai coupled with a virtual voice assistant like amazons alexa for business microsofts cortana google assistant or apples siri could enable natural language data queries for example you could say hey cortana pull up the q4 sales figures and projections for q1 next year if deploying an ai engine to listen to discussions in a meeting or read textbased conversations in a team app the agent could then offer assistance such as would you like me to schedule a task for john to develop budget projections for the new marketing campaignrealtime language translation which enables global workgroups to communicate and collaborate in their native languages and receive native language meeting transcriptions efficient schedules such as calendar systems or meeting applications enabled to automatically schedule future calls based on a projects schedule and availability without individuals having to manually search calendars for availability or worse yet exchange emails to find an appropriate meeting time quicker feedback by integrating chatbots into team applications to enable native language collaboration capabilities such as polling team participants for a status update or providing alerts to team members when the ai engine detects an anomaly in a related business process for example a systems failure could trigger ai tools to create popup messages in the team apps or new conversation channels and it could automatically input relevant datathe ai application could recognize individuals as they enter a meeting room prompting the meeting system to say hi julie i see you have a 400 pm status meeting would you like me to start it this saves time starting audio video and web conferencing bridges as well as retrieving digital whiteboards and shared files it could take attendance by visually or audibly recognizing employees as they join meetings and the ai could use data analytics to help facilities and uc managers gain insight into how meeting spaces are being used how many people are in a typical meeting and how long they use the roomcompliance and security it leaders especially those in regulated industries are likely to be wary about ais access to corporate information and the way that information is stored within ai engines as ai platforms become targets for attack expect to pay closer attention to how that data is protected reliance on cloud the computing power required for ai as well as the need for rapid application evolution typically means that ai platforms are cloudbased and use microservicesbased architectures that leads to data security issues as well the need to ensure that data is stored in accordance with standards like the general data protection regulation business case many of the previously described scenarios are difficult to quantify for enterprises trying to determine return on investment vendors likely will integrate aidriven applications into their current offerings rather than sell separate tools requiring their own licenses or software acquisitions still enterprises will incur costs related to training and it support that they will need to balance with measurable productivity gains and process improvements it leaders will want to ensure that they have the necessary visibility into business processes to help identify benefits to using

around since the times of antiquity even if the actual term was coined centuries later at dartmouth college in 1956 certainly we find many examples of thinking machines in ancient myths and in more recent years the literature and film industries have recurrently drawn upon that idea to create all kinds of stories and ultimately that is how many people see ai as an idea bound up with the realm of myths and science fictionhowever this preconception may soon change considering some of the recent developments in this area selfparking cars are already available on the market and according to major car manufacturers’ expectations selfdriven cars will arrive in 5 to 10 years’ time unmanned aircrafts and drones are becoming increasingly common in many fields border control package delivery etc we also have several examples of programmes with certain learning capabilities web ads search engines like google search or apps like siri and viv which use a natural language user interface adapting to the users individual language usage and individual preferences with continuing use and returning individualized resultscertainly the opinion of a significant section of the scientific community seems to be that ai will arrive shortly considering that in the past few months several renowned scientists have emphasized the risks of ai and the need for worldwide regulation on the subject the best example of this is the open letter recently published by the future of life institute “fli” which has been signed by a number of respected scientists including elon musk cofounder of paypal tesla motors and spacex or preeminent astrophysicist dr stephen hawkinsthe letter includes a list of research priorities which put forward several interesting and complex questions requiring an adequate solution we do not presume to have any or all of the answers but we would like to outline some of the most complicated aspects and propose some additional questions to considershort term horizon autonomous systemsconsidering the short term research priorities set out in fli’s letter what we can hope to expect from ai in the near future are increasingly autonomous systems such as selfdriven cars autonomous trading systems more efficient information managing programmes fully automated factories etc from a legal perspective we would be interested in exploring one of its most fundamental aspects which is potential liability in the event of damages caused by an autonomous systemfli’s letter addresses this issue in connection with liability for accidents caused by selfdriven cars although this concern could be extended to drones and other automated vehiclesfirstly who exactly should be taking out the premiums of the obligatory insurance policies associated with the vehicle the ratio legis behind mandatory insurance policies is that a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous and thus its owner must guarantee cover for any damages caused by it however if control over the vehicle is taken from the owner and given to an autonomous system it could be argued that it should be its manufacturer who bears the cost of the insurance policy or perhaps that it should be shared between the manufacturer and the ownera different question would be the actual allocation of liability in the event of an accident assuming that all control over the vehicle is taken away from the driver for lack of a better word how could heshe be held liable for the damages caused in an accident thus we need to explore the potential liability of the manufacturerif the damages were caused due to a faulty design malfunction andor assembly of the vehicle the matter does not present any particular complexity as in such an event it is clear that the manufacturer should be held liablehowever liabilities cannot be so easily allocated if no malfunction is involved in the accident for example if a system which is working properly detects a potential risk but cannot react fast enough current legal doctrine would dictate that no liability should be allocated to the manufacturer if the system was working in accordance with current scientific knowledge and technology and had been approved by the relevant public authorityconsidering the above the standards set by the public authorities in order to approve any given autonomous system will have to be carefully measured in order to set these standards a consideration of paramount importance and great complexity is how a system should ponder the potential risk of causing injury to a person versus the risk of causing economic damagesobviously human life and health should always be prioritised over property damage thus when probabilities are levelled the system should avoid the chance of causing personal injury and assume the risk of causing economic damages however if the probability of causing personal injury is very small the answer might be different indeed if we took the avoidance of risk to humans to extremes we could reach a point where no system would operate since there would always be such a risk however there is a huge grey area in the middle where several factors should be considered in order to set boundaries which would constitute a sorites paradoxof course there are many other questions that autonomous systems will bring up from a legal perspective for example issues related to privacy and security of personal data can autonomous systems share personal data or labourrelated matterslong term sapient selfaware systemsin the long term the questions and challenges will become far more complex and challenging as they will exceed the boundaries of both computer science and laws and will enter into the territory of ethics philosophy and even religion similarly to other highly controversial fields of scientific investigation such as human cloning stem cell research or genetic engineeringif a truly sapient machine could ultimately be created which in view of fli’s letter seems conceivable it will likely be a turning point in human history the potential benefits and indeed risks are immense and a lot of them may probably be far beyond what we currently consider as even remotely possible as will be the questions that will need to be answeredindeed we may have to consider if such sapient machines should have a legal cybernetic personality and whether they could be held liable we may also have to ask ourselves if those machines can own property and have other civil rights or even if they can be actually owned or on the contrary if owning a truly sapient selfaware creature even if an artificial one would be tantamount to slaveryperhaps some of these ideas might seem farfetched and even somewhat shocking however rather than providing any answers these are merely questions that the legal community and other professionals should begin to think aboutnew questionsthe development of artificial intelligence which is likely to speed up in the near future will bring forth new and complex questions to which no legal system in the world has an answer it is therefore necessary for the legal community to begin to consider the answersluis franco is a

lawgeex a tel aviv legaltech startupwhats artificial intelligence ai and why should lawyers care about it on a practical level lawyers should be aware that software powered by ai already carries out legal tasks within a few years ai will be taking over or at least affecting a significant amount of work now done by lawyers thirtynine percent of inhouse counsel expect that ai will be commonplace in legal work within ten yearson a more philosophical level lawyers should understand that the decisions made by aipowered software will raise significant legal questions including those of tort liability and of criminal guilt for example if ai is controlling a driverless car and someones killed in an accident whos at faultwhile the philosophical questions are important to resolve this comment will focus on the practical issues to provide an overview of what ai is and how it will be used in the legal profession this comment addresses several questionslets start with a few definitionsartificial intelligence is the term used to describe how computers can perform tasks normally viewed as requiring human intelligence such as recognizing speech and objects making decisions based on data and translating languages ai mimics certain operations of the human mindmachine learning is an application of ai in which computers use algorithms rules embodied in software to learn from data and adapt with experiencea neural network is a computer that classifies information putting things into buckets based on their characteristics the hotdog identifying app from hbos silicon valley is an example of one application of this technologysome ai programs train themselves through trial and error for example using a technique called neuroevolution researchers at elon musks openai research center set up an algorithm with policies for getting high scores on atari videogames several hundred copies of these rules were created on different computers with random variations the computers then played the games to learn which policies were most effective and fed those results back into the system ai can also be used to build better ai google is building algorithms that analyze other algorithms to learn which methods are more successfulother ai programs need to be trained by humans feeding them data the ai then derives patterns and rules from that data ai programs trained through machine learning are wellsuited to solve classification problems this basically means calculating the probability that certain information is either of type a or type b for example determining whether a given bear is a panda or a koala is a classification problemthe training starts with showing the computer lots of samples of pandas and koalas these initial samples are called the training set and clearly identify which type of bear is being presented to the aithe ai builds a modela set of rulesto distinguish between pandas and koalas that model might be based on things like size coloring the shape of the ears and what the animal eats bamboo or eucalyptusafter training the ai can be tested with new pandas and koalas to see whether it classifies them correctly if it doesnt do very well the algorithm may need to be tweaked or the training set may need to be expanded to give the ai more data to crunchat this point in its development ai is good at finding items that meet humandefined criteria and detecting patterns in data in other words ai can figure out what makes a panda a panda and what distinguishes it from a koalawhich lets it find the pandas in a collection of random bears these are sometimes called searchandfind type tasksonce its identified something the ai can then apply humandefined rules and take actions in the case of legal work an ai can carry out tasks likeaccording to stefanie yuen thio joint managing partner and head of corporate at tsmp law corp in singapore legal work thats repetitive requiring minimal professional intervention or based on a template will become the sole province of software in addition she saysai can help consumers by providing a form of legal service to clients who might otherwise not be able to afford a lawyer the free service donotpay created by a 19yearold is an aipowered chatbot that lets users contest parking tickets in london and new york in its first 21 months it took on 250000 cases and won 160000 of them saving users more than 4 million worth of fines the same program is helping consumers file databreachrelated suits against equifax for up to 25000though it cant help them litigate their casesaccording to yuen thio ai cant yet replicate advocacy negotiation or structuring of complex deals the new york times suggested that tasks like advising clients writing briefs negotiating deals and appearing in court were beyond the reach of computerization at least for a while ai also isnt yet very good at the type of creative writing in a supreme court brief or a movie scriptlawyers are already using ai to do things like reviewing documents during litigation and due diligence analyzing contracts to determine whether they meet predetermined criteria performing legal research and predicting case outcomesdocument review for litigation involves the task of looking for relevant documentsfor example documents containing specific keywords or emails from ms x to mr y concerning topic z during march 2016 setting search parameters for document review doesnt require ai but using ai improves the speed accuracy and efficiency of document analysisfor example when lawyers using aipowered software for document review flag certain documents as relevant the ai learns what type of documents its supposed to be looking for hence it can more accurately identify other relevant documents this is called predictive coding predictive coding offers many advantages over oldschool manual document review among other things itpredictive coding has been widely accepted as a document review method by us courts since the 2012 decision in da silva moore v publicus groupeclients need to analyze contracts both in bulk and on an individual basisfor example analysis of all contracts a company has signed can identify risks anomalies future financial obligations renewal and expiration dates etc for companies with hundreds or thousands of contracts this can be a slow expensive laborintensive and errorprone process assuming the contracts arent already entered into a robust contract management system its also boring for the lawyers or others tasked with doing iton a daytoday basis lawyers review contracts make comments and redlines and advise clients on whether to sign contracts asis or try to negotiate better terms these contracts can range from simple eg ndas to complex a backlog of contracts to review can create a bottleneck that delays deals and the associated revenues lawyers especially inexperienced ones can miss important issues that can come back to bite their clients laterai can help with both bulk and individual contract reviewat jpmorgan an aipowered program called coin has been used since june 2017 to interpret commercial loan agreements work that previously took 360000 lawyerhours can now be done in seconds the bank is planning to use the technology for other types of legal documents as wellsome ai platforms such as the one provided by kira systems allow lawyers to identify extract and analyze business information contained in large volumes of contract data this is used to create contract summary charts for ma due diligencethe company i work for lawgeex uses ai to analyze contracts one at a time as part of a lawyers daily workflow to start with lawyers set up their lawgeex playbooks by selecting from a list of clauses and variations to require accept or reject for example a california governing law clause might be ok but genovian law isnt then when someone uploads a contract the ai scans it and determines what clauses and variations are present and missing the relevant language is highlighted and marked with a green thumbsup or a red thumbsdown based on the clients preset criteriainhouse lawyers use lawgeex to triage standard agreements like ndas contracts meeting predefined criteria can be preapproved for signature those that dont are kicked to the legal department for further review and revisionany lawyer whos ever done research using lexis or westlaw has used legal automation finding relevant cases in previous eras involving the laborious process of looking up headnote numbers and shepardizing in paper volumes but ai takes research to the next level for example ross intelligence uses the power of ibms watson supercomputer to find similar cases it can even respond to queries in plain english the power of aienabled research is striking using common research methods a bankruptcy lawyer found a case nearly identical to the one he was working on in 10 hours rosss ai found it almost instantlylawyers are often called upon to predict the future if i bring this case how likely is it that ill win and how much will it cost me should i settle this case or take a plea or take my chances at trial more experienced lawyers are often better at making accurate predictions because they have more years of data to work withhowever no lawyer has complete knowledge of all the relevant databecause ai can access more of the relevant data it can be better than lawyers at predicting the outcomes of legal disputes and proceedings and thus helping clients make decisions for example a london law firm used data on the outcomes of 600 cases over 12 months to create a model for the viability of personal injury cases indeed trained on 200 years of supreme court records an ai is already better than many human experts at predicting scotus decisionsa consensus has emerged that ai will significantly disrupt the legal market ai will impact the availability of legal sector jobs the business models of many law firms and how inhouse counsel leverage technologyaccording to deloitte about 100000 legal sector jobs are likely to be automated in the next twenty years deloitte claims 39 of legal jobs can be automated mckinsey global institute estimates that 23 of a lawyers job could be automated some estimates suggest that adopting all legal technology including ai already available now would reduce lawyers hours by 13law firms are notoriously slow to adapt to new technologies enhancing efficiency is often seen as contrary to the economic goal of maximizing billable hours lawyers are also seen as being technophobichowever many law firms are trying to understand and use new legal technologies including ai according to the london times the vast majority of the uk’s top 100 law firms are either using artificial intelligence or assessing the technology firms adopting ai systems include latham watkins baker mckenzie slaughter may and singapores dentons rodyk davidsonron dolin a senior research fellow at harvard law schools center on the legal profession says that traditional law firm business models based on armies of first year associates racking up billable hours doing ma contract review are doomed by the advent of ai this isnt necessarily bad news for junior associatesor at least for the ones who still have jobsas many hated doing contract review in the first placefirms that fail to take advantage of aipowered efficiencies may lag in competing with those who doat least to the extent clients insist on fixedrate billingthus lawyers who understand technology and educate themselves about the latest legaltech developments may be of increasing value to their firmscorporate counsel have obvious reasons to adopt ai unlike attorneys in law firms corporate counsel have no incentive to maximize their hours indeed many lawyers go inhouse to improve their worklife balance which includes getting home at a reasonable hour theyre also often subject to strict budget and headcount constraints so they have to figure out how to get more done with limited resources ai helps inhouse lawyers get home earlier without increasing their departmental budgetsthe aba model rules of professional conduct model rules require that lawyers be competentand that they keep up with new technology as comment 8 statesat least 27 states have adopted some form of this model rule in january of 2017 florida became the first state to require technology training as part of its continuing legal education requirement other states seem likely to follow suit indeed failing to use commonly available technology like email and ediscovery software can be grounds for a malpractice claim or suspension by the barof course aipowered legal automation is not yet common but it soon will bespending on ai is expected to grow rapidlyfrom 8 billion in 2016 to 47 billion in 2020as ai is seen as reducing costs and increasing efficiency top mba programs already have courses on how

strategylike digital transformation before it establishing an enterprise artificial intelligence strategy is so new there is no playbook to crib from and even if a playbook did exist cios would still have to contend with the ongoing proliferation of technology meaning theyd have to customize their investments in ai and plans of action as ai tools evolvethe good news is that early adopters of ai arent operating in a vacuum they can rely on triedandtrue methods for building a new technology competency such as creating a center of excellence by establishing an artificial intelligence center of excellence coe companies can formalize their vision for and approach to aimilind wagle global cio at data center provider equinix inc is just beginning to make a case for an enterprise artificial intelligence strategy hes tapped members of his enterprise architecture team to keep tabs on the market and to uncover potential use cases and his team has also taken on a couple of projects to prove out the value of artificial intelligence investmentsone such project is an internal chatbot embedded into the corporate intranet that helps with things like employee training submitting expense reports and ordering new equipment we call it eva wagle said and its a conversational interface that lets the employee community get answers to a whole bunch of questions in a very contextrich mannerbut these efforts are new and while wagle is optimistic about where artificial intelligence is headed hes found that the technologies for use in the enterprise are still immature right now hes busy setting the groundworkas these technologies mature as we start to get more traction we are going to put some investment behind this in terms of resourcing and governance and create a team around it he said its like any other it capability that you launch if youre getting traction then theres a need to nurture enhance and support it and that will require investment and effortwagle doesnt call this team an artificial intelligence center of excellence but he could centers of excellence are often established to deal with new technologies skills or disciplines that dont fit neatly into the enterprise their aim is to provide governance and to prioritize efforts and they can help companies avoid classic pitfalls such as a tendency to focus on technology rather than use casefor most enterprises its very important that they start from the business perspective said bern elliot an analyst at gartner the artificial intelligence center of excellence is a way to help address the technical needs while also balancing it with the business needswalking the line between shiny new tech and what the business really needs is especially delicate for artificial intelligence its the advances in technology that are propelling the conversation in the first place encouraging companies to focus on possibility rather than concrete business problems but elliot said thats a big mistakeno one does anything with a neural network he said referring to the deep learning technique modeled after the hierarchical arrangement of neurons in biological sensory systems its really the applications of ai that make ai usefulrather than a single artificial intelligence center of excellence elliot teased out three strategic components to consider ai business innovation ai policies and governance and an ai skills center of excellence cios need to keep tabs on all three he saidthe business innovation piece is conducted in consultation with the lines of business to determine what applications and uses cases are most important and how they should be prioritizedthe ai policies and governance piece establishes guidelines on what to watch out for and best practices to follow you will be using data extensively in some cases he said in others you may be exposing the application to customers and you want to make sure its done in the right wayonce a project has been selected companies will need to get their skills house in order thats where the skills center of excellence comes into play the skills coe can include general skills such as data science and data analytics skills as well as aispecific skills such as deep neural networks and natural language understanding the artificial intelligence skills center of excellence is a way to help marshal and manage your skills he saidin many cases a skills team member wont be reassigned to the artificial intelligence skills center of excellence permanently instead team members will participate virtually tapped to help with a project based on how their particular skills applyfinally the skills coe doesnt have to be internal employees only in some cases these are difficult skills to develop elliot said or it may not be in a companys best interest to hire and train employees who leave a couple of years later because their market value is significantly higherthis is a perennial problem when a new technology comes along he said its why companies go to consultants because they get a skills solution provider who comes in and helps complete a project the company can maintain the relationship but they dont have to retain the staffmoiz kohari senior vice president and chief technology architect at state street corp in boston said being fully virtual is key to an artificial intelligence strategy in fact hes pushing back against an artificial intelligence center of excellence precisely because it conjures up the idea of a physical groupas a global company with talent scattered from china to boston and everywhere in between kohari said he finds the physicality of a traditional coe to be shortsighted we find it much more useful to be able to direct the right minds to the right problems he saidhis model is inspired in part by the open source community experts from around the world dont have to be working out of the same room on a project like the linux kernel a unixlike operating system the way it works is you have maintainers of certain areas of the project and you have contributors to that project he said contributors submit code to a githublike environment where its reviewed and accepted before its approved by project maintainers that kind of workflow exists at state streetby giving up the idea of a physical coe state street can think about leadership on a global rather than local scale we find that hiring the best minds wherever they may be is the most beneficial approach for us kohari saidthe company has identified specific technology areas it believes are critical to the financial institutions future including anomaly detection natural language processing and predictive analytics for each technology theyve sought to create a nucleus an expert or a couple of experts who can build a team and oversee projects that address business challenges in these areasthese nuclei are absolute rock stars in their fields im not just saying that kohari said these are guys who arent only contributing to projects but started or were founders of some of those projects he saidstate street supports their nuclei by embedding management talent onto the team to keep track of a projects progress the last thing you want to do is take one of the smartest people who works on anomaly libraries for anomaly detection and burden them with management challenges he saidnicole

confirm that i have read and accepted the terms of use and declaration of consentand artificial intelligence i came away wondering why theyre so far apartboth involve number crunching at their core but while bi is primarily retrospective in nature ai is all about the future the statistical analysis behind bi is primarily about basic counts in contrast with the ultrasophisticated machine learning and deep learning algorithms that underpin aibecause of these differences and the fact that ai as a useful tool is relatively new while bi is yesterdays news we treat the two disciplines as wholly separate during my time at the oreilly ai conference in new york in late june i heard not a single mention of bi conversely at dresner advisory services llcs real business intelligence conference held on the campus of mit in july ai was primarily used as a counterpoint to bi in discussions of the latters strong business value and high adoptionbut speaker mico yuk ceo of consultancy bi brainz in atlanta had an interesting idea im hoping that with more machine learning key performance indicators will grow and evolve she said im hoping we can work on metrics using data science and make kpis work for you rather than you working for themin her vision machine learning algorithms deployed in bi software will tell businesses whats interesting in their historical data right now analysts typically have to define metrics for bi tools to track its a manual process and it only makes visible data the company already knows is importantbut machine learningenabled bi could delve deeper into a business unknown unknowns finding insights in previously unexamined data taken a step further aipowered bi could take advantage of natural language generation capabilities to explain to the business what these insights mean and how they might act on themthis isnt exactly a revolutionary idea bi vendor sisense announced in april a data discovery component to its software that automatically reviews data and alerts users to new and potentially interesting features other vendors are also adding machine learning components to their software analyst firm gartner has been talking about smart data discovery since at least 2015 but it wasnt until this springs magic quadrant report on bi and analytics platforms that gartner declared smart data discovery the next disruptor in the bi software marketthere is some momentum around the idea of combining machine learning business intelligence and artificial intelligence but based on my reporting the idea seems to have seeped little into the general publics consciousness we still mostly see ai and bi as separate domainsthis has to change think of all the time aipowered bi platforms could free up for analysts who currently spend much of their time handling requests for reports they could move on to more effective data science and predictive analytics projects weve seen from companies like uber and google that smart approaches to machine learning can create entirely new profitable business models thats the kind of thing people with strong analytics skills should be spending their time onmaybe once the hype surrounding ai starts to wear off the differences between it and bi will seem smaller and the opportunity more obvious after all were already seeing ai having a big impact on crm hr and fintech software theres no

intelligence', 'h2': 'sebastian ulbert', 'h5': 'artificial intelligence aiartificial general intelligence agiartificial superintelligence asi', 'p': 'coresystems is now part of sap3 april 2017 3 minwhat exactly is artificial intelligence and what is the difference between general intelligence and super intelligence can we expect benevolent robots to be walking amongst us in the near future40 years ago today science fiction’s most iconic film was released star wars gave us two of our most beloved onscreen robots though r2d2 and c3po were far more advanced than anything existing then and even now artificial intelligence was already well on its way when the film premiered in fact the father of ai had already designed a test to determine a machine’s intelligence back in 1950 the turing test created by mathematician and computer scientist alan turing asked a judge to field a series of questions to two participants one machine and one human based on the responses the judge would then determine the human responder the computer was deemed intelligent if it was able to fool the judge at least 50 percent of the timesimply put artificial intelligence refers to a machine’s ability to imitate human cognitive abilities like problem solving and learning these skills also require an understanding of language and speech and strategic thinking we already encounter numerous applications of artificial intelligence on a daily basis when we ask siri for directions when driving past google’s autonomous vehicles when we use selfparking or cruise control featureshowever inspired by film and literature many people are more familiar with the concept of artificial general intelligence agi computers would be equally intelligent to humans in every aspect these machines would be capable of performing the same kind of intellectual tasks that humans perform with the same level of success apple’s cofounder steve wozniak developed the coffee test as an indicator for agi during the test a robot has to enter an average home and attempt to make coffee this means finding all the tools figuring out how they operate and then performing the task a robot able to complete this test would be considered an example of agi think c3pobut what about hal 9000 the 2001 a space odyssey horror computer is also still currently the stuff of fiction this field of ai is called artificial superintelligence and it is also the field of research that stephen hawking has warned us about one of ai’s leading figures nick bostrom has defined superintelligence as “an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field including scientific creativity general wisdom and social skills” this slight or vast superiority to human intellect is disconcerting to scientists and laymen because its outcome is unknown a machine capable of constantly learning and improving itself could be unstoppablewhere exactly is ai headed some of the most exciting advancements in ai are a result of selflearning and analytics for examplea study published by nature outlined the work of a team of researchers on “simulated childhood” this is a robot’s ability to detect a malfunction and use a process of trial and error to determine the defect and repair it in a matter of minutes the robots tested could identify a problem and determine the best ways to fix itself the robots could repair 14 forms of damagein 2013 a computer had the intelligence level of a 4year old child in 2014 a computer was able to solve a mathematical problem so complex that the most intelligent human minds could not check for accuracy computer scientist and futurist ray kurzweil said that computer intelligence would reach human levels by 2029by analyzing data from over 100 million articles sgi altix supercomputer nautilus was able to predict the future the computer could assess tone and mood connect it to geographical locations and use that information to foresee internet entrepreneur kalev leetaru who fed the computer all the information considers it akin to weather forecasting “its never perfect but we can do better than random guessing”it is clear that ai has resulted in machines that are in many ways more capable than human minds however it will be a long time before they are able to surpass human intelligence in every regard and should this day come

expected here are three things every geek who dreamed of a robot future needs to knowdo androids dream of electric sheep thats unclear but i know for sure that every kid dreams of intelligent thinking robots certainly every kid who goes on to work at cnet in any caseas we veer ever closer to the year 2016 my scififuelled childhood fantasies of a bot with a brain the size of a planet are closer than ever to being realised 2015 saw drones taking to the skies while back on the ground artificial intelligence programs are achieving aboveaverage scores on college entrance exams artificial intelligence or ai is the practice of making a machine behave in a practical responsive way its already changing our world and is by my reckoning the most fascinating field of technology right nowbut as one professor i spoke to for this story put it the audacity of the attempt to build an intelligent machine comes with a responsibility to know what were meddling with for everyone who ever thumbed through a copy of i robot mouth agape heres what you need to know about ai in the modern worldmention the phrase killer robot in conversation and youll almost certainly raise a smile your peers doubtless imagining a glowing blue humanoid cyborg sadly pondering what is love before its eyes turn red and it selfdestructs obliterating the northern hemisphereclick here for more stories in cnets most exciting tech seriesdeeply ingrained in modern pop culture is the notion that some manner of ai uprising is on the cards james camerons iconic image of a terminator stamping on a mound of human skulls is never far from any geeks thoughtsthat playful cinematic and deeply poetic cultural artifact belies the very real threat humanity faces however not from killer robots overthrowing their human masters but from intelligent robots following ordersthe immediate threat experts warn comes in the form of autonomous weapons military machines capable of killing without permission from a human from unmanned planes to missile defence systems to sentry robots weve already got military hardware that functions with very little input from a human mindgroups such as the campaign to stop killer robots say were inching ever closer to closing the loop and letting machines handle our killing for us a scenario thats legally pragmatically and of course ethically problematicthe less sensationally named future of life institute recently published an open letter signed by hundreds of ai researchers and famous tech personalities warning if any major military power pushes ahead with ai weapon development a global arms race is virtually inevitable and the endpoint of this technological trajectory is obvious autonomous weapons will become the kalashnikovs of tomorrowthe campaign to stop killer robots a coalition of more than 50 nongovernmental organisations claims its making progress towards a treaty one akin to the international agreement outlawing chemical weapons the un has already hosted discussions on the subject of autonomous murderbots one huge obstacle facing these groups however is that to rave about imminent robot slaughter makes you look like a crackpot whos watched the matrix one too many timeshumanity needs to revise its popcultureinstilled notion that robots becoming selfaware and robots wiping out humanity will occur simultaneously machines that become smart enough to ponder their own existence may certainly be a problem decades down the line but phenomenal advances in ai mean that robots that kill without even being programmed to understand the barest concept of mercy are uncomfortably closeartificial intelligence takes many forms and while weve successfully programmed machines to clean our floors set alarms on our phones park our cars and take out military installations from above the clouds things like introspection and selfawareness are proving a little toughertelling a joke making an ethical judgement deciding that you want to collaborate with some individuals and not others this rich texture of human life isnt there in our machines at all said sir nigel shadbolt professor of computer science at oxford universityfor decades humans have looked forward to the socalled singularity the moment of selfawareness that creates an explosion in selfimproving machine intelligence this will be triggered its presumed by the exponential growth of computing power coupled with advancing software complexityfuturist ray kurzweil predicted in a 2005 book that a model of human intelligence would be achieved as soon as the mid 2020s what appears to be the case now however is that the complexity of our own minds the key that gives rise to consciousness is a lot more well complicated than we imaginedthat spark of awareness in your head we dont know where that comes from shadbolt said the complexity we embody that allows consciousness to happen isnt just by the fact that weve got this kind of cortex this rational brain we have an endocrine system were emotional we have the threelayer brainwe are extraordinarily complex and we have only begun to unpack just a tiny amount of that at this pointits still the hard problem shadbolt said later joking when i ask what the biggest public misconception is concerning ai that its just 10 years down the roadthat sentiment is shared by murray shanahan professor of cognitive robotics at imperial college london who told me the media often gives the impression that humanlevel ai of the sort we see in scifi movies is just around the corner but its almost certainly decades awaytwo of the major problems shanahan explained are endowing computers and robots with a common sense understanding of the everyday world and endowing them with creativity by creativity i dont mean the sort of thing we see in the picassos or einsteins of the world but rather the sort of thing that every child is capable offrom the terminator series to movies such as i robot chappie ex machina and even short circuit the way we portray ai on screen has traditionally been humancentric we tend to imagine a being that essentially looks and acts a lot like a person as ai spreads into every aspect of our life we should be prepared to broaden our horizons when it comes to imagining the bounds and types of intelligence that can be valuable after all weve got plenty of humangrade intelligence alreadythe point cant be just to replicate ourselves shadbolt said weve got very interesting biological ways of doing that so why on earth would we want to do it in siliconfrom the humble roomba to googles animallike selfdriving car siri or neural networks that oversee data centres ai is branching out in ways we couldnt have imagined decades ago if you define intelligence in a way thats more machinecentric professor alan woodward told me last year in an interview on the fading relevance of the turing test youll find some very intelligent machines out there alreadythat diversity in the kinds of ai now emerging may in part come down to the breadth of disciplines currently investigating machine intelligence theres a broad range of subjects now that look at the problem shadbolt said psychologists look at it from a human context there are animal psychologists physiologists neuroscientists ai practitioners all looking at it with a different anglefundamentally well need an interdisciplinary approach so for me there isnt one single discipline that will have all the answersthats the face of modern ai taskcentric wildly diverse intelligent systems essentially mindless for now but busily changing every aspect of human life nonetheless whether its public transport or patrolling the skies the ai of today is nothing like the gloomy glowing cyborg we once pictured its weirder more fascinating more surprising its better than we imaginedfirst black hole image revealed and its the eye of sauron the event horizon telescope captures one of the most powerful objects in

lists saving you from manually looking for materials relevant to the conversation ai coupled with a virtual voice assistant like amazons alexa for business microsofts cortana google assistant or apples siri could enable natural language data queries for example you could say hey cortana pull up the q4 sales figures and projections for q1 next year if deploying an ai engine to listen to discussions in a meeting or read textbased conversations in a team app the agent could then offer assistance such as would you like me to schedule a task for john to develop budget projections for the new marketing campaignrealtime language translation which enables global workgroups to communicate and collaborate in their native languages and receive native language meeting transcriptions efficient schedules such as calendar systems or meeting applications enabled to automatically schedule future calls based on a projects schedule and availability without individuals having to manually search calendars for availability or worse yet exchange emails to find an appropriate meeting time quicker feedback by integrating chatbots into team applications to enable native language collaboration capabilities such as polling team participants for a status update or providing alerts to team members when the ai engine detects an anomaly in a related business process for example a systems failure could trigger ai tools to create popup messages in the team apps or new conversation channels and it could automatically input relevant datathe ai application could recognize individuals as they enter a meeting room prompting the meeting system to say hi julie i see you have a 400 pm status meeting would you like me to start it this saves time starting audio video and web conferencing bridges as well as retrieving digital whiteboards and shared files it could take attendance by visually or audibly recognizing employees as they join meetings and the ai could use data analytics to help facilities and uc managers gain insight into how meeting spaces are being used how many people are in a typical meeting and how long they use the roomcompliance and security it leaders especially those in regulated industries are likely to be wary about ais access to corporate information and the way that information is stored within ai engines as ai platforms become targets for attack expect to pay closer attention to how that data is protected reliance on cloud the computing power required for ai as well as the need for rapid application evolution typically means that ai platforms are cloudbased and use microservicesbased architectures that leads to data security issues as well the need to ensure that data is stored in accordance with standards like the general data protection regulation business case many of the previously described scenarios are difficult to quantify for enterprises trying to determine return on investment vendors likely will integrate aidriven applications into their current offerings rather than sell separate tools requiring their own licenses or software acquisitions still enterprises will incur costs related to training and it support that they will need to balance with measurable productivity gains and process improvements it leaders will want to ensure that they have the necessary visibility into business processes to

discovery currently the players have started addressing the identified gaps in healthcare services and have developed applications and solutions that are aimed to enhance productivity at hospitals and clinics by providing exceptional operational ease also efforts are been made to introduce artificial intelligence based surgical robots that will help in reducing surgical complications as this industry is still in initial phases of growth key industry players will leverage advanced technology to conceptualize and market highly upgraded and reliable software that will probably replace the conventional systems utilized earlier proving beneficial for the industry growthwhat information does this report containour market research reports includewhy global market insightsconnect with our

'contact ussubscriptionscommercial', 'p': 'artificial intelligence throws up a range of legal issues says luis franco of pérezllorcaolga nikonovathe idea of artificial intelligence ‘ai’ has been around since the times of antiquity even if the actual term was coined centuries later at dartmouth college in 1956 certainly we find many examples of thinking machines in ancient myths and in more recent years the literature and film industries have recurrently drawn upon that idea to create all kinds of stories and ultimately that is how many people see ai as an idea bound up with the realm of myths and science fictionhowever this preconception may soon change considering some of the recent developments in this area selfparking cars are already available on the market and according to major car manufacturers’ expectations selfdriven cars will arrive in 5 to 10 years’ time unmanned aircrafts and drones are becoming increasingly common in many fields border control package delivery etc we also have several examples of programmes with certain learning capabilities web ads search engines like google search or apps like siri and viv which use a natural language user interface adapting to the users individual language usage and individual preferences with continuing use and returning individualized resultscertainly the opinion of a significant section of the scientific community seems to be that ai will arrive shortly considering that in the past few months several renowned scientists have emphasized the risks of ai and the need for worldwide regulation on the subject the best example of this is the open letter recently published by the future of life institute “fli” which has been signed by a number of respected scientists including elon musk cofounder of paypal tesla motors and spacex or preeminent astrophysicist dr stephen hawkinsthe letter includes a list of research priorities which put forward several interesting and complex questions requiring an adequate solution we do not presume to have any or all of the answers but we would like to outline some of the most complicated aspects and propose some additional questions to considershort term horizon autonomous systemsconsidering the short term research priorities set out in fli’s letter what we can hope to expect from ai in the near future are increasingly autonomous systems such as selfdriven cars autonomous trading systems more efficient information managing programmes fully automated factories etc from a legal perspective we would be interested in exploring one of its most fundamental aspects which is potential liability in the event of damages caused by an autonomous systemfli’s letter addresses this issue in connection with liability for accidents caused by selfdriven cars although this concern could be extended to drones and other automated vehiclesfirstly who exactly should be taking out the premiums of the obligatory insurance policies associated with the vehicle the ratio legis behind mandatory insurance policies is that a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous and thus its owner must guarantee cover for any damages caused by it however if control over the vehicle is taken from the owner and given to an autonomous system it could be argued that it should be its manufacturer who bears the cost of the insurance policy or perhaps that it should be shared between the manufacturer and the ownera different question would be the actual allocation of liability in the event of an accident assuming that all control over the vehicle is taken away from the driver for lack of a better word how could heshe be held liable for the damages caused in an accident thus we need to explore the potential liability of the manufacturerif the damages were caused due to a faulty design malfunction andor assembly of the vehicle the matter does not present any particular complexity as in such an event it is clear that the manufacturer should be held liablehowever liabilities cannot be so easily allocated if no malfunction is involved in the accident for example if a system which is working properly detects a potential risk but cannot react fast enough current legal doctrine would dictate that no liability should be allocated to the manufacturer if the system was working in accordance with current scientific knowledge and technology and had been approved by the relevant public authorityconsidering the above the standards set by the public authorities in order to approve any given autonomous system will have to be carefully measured in order to set these standards a consideration of paramount importance and great complexity is how a system should ponder the potential risk of causing injury to a person versus the risk of causing economic damagesobviously human life and health should always be prioritised over property damage thus when probabilities are levelled the system should avoid the chance of causing personal injury and assume the risk of causing economic damages however if the probability of causing personal injury is very small the answer might be different indeed if we took the avoidance of risk to humans to extremes we could reach a point where no system would operate since there would always be such a risk however there is a huge grey area in the middle where several factors should be considered in order to set boundaries which would constitute a sorites paradoxof course there are many other questions that autonomous systems will bring up from a legal perspective for example issues related to privacy and security of personal data can autonomous systems share personal data or labourrelated matterslong term sapient selfaware systemsin the long term the questions and challenges will become far more complex and challenging as they will exceed the boundaries of both computer science and laws and will enter into the territory of ethics philosophy and even religion similarly to other highly controversial fields of scientific investigation such as human cloning stem cell research or genetic engineeringif a truly sapient machine could ultimately be created which in view of fli’s letter seems conceivable it will likely be a turning point in human history the potential benefits and indeed risks are immense and a lot of them may probably be far beyond what we currently consider as even remotely possible as will be the questions that will need to be answeredindeed we may have to consider if such sapient machines should have a legal cybernetic personality and whether they could be held liable we may also have to ask ourselves if those machines can own property and have other civil rights or even if they can be actually owned or on the contrary if owning a truly sapient selfaware creature even if an artificial one would be tantamount to slaveryperhaps some of these ideas might seem farfetched and even somewhat shocking however rather than providing any answers these are merely questions that the legal community and other professionals should begin to think aboutnew questionsthe development of artificial intelligence which is likely to speed up in the near future will bring forth new and complex questions to which no legal system in the world has an answer it is therefore necessary for the legal community to begin to consider the answersluis franco is a

lawgeex a tel aviv legaltech startupwhats artificial intelligence ai and why should lawyers care about it on a practical level lawyers should be aware that software powered by ai already carries out legal tasks within a few years ai will be taking over or at least affecting a significant amount of work now done by lawyers thirtynine percent of inhouse counsel expect that ai will be commonplace in legal work within ten yearson a more philosophical level lawyers should understand that the decisions made by aipowered software will raise significant legal questions including those of tort liability and of criminal guilt for example if ai is controlling a driverless car and someones killed in an accident whos at faultwhile the philosophical questions are important to resolve this comment will focus on the practical issues to provide an overview of what ai is and how it will be used in the legal profession this comment addresses several questionslets start with a few definitionsartificial intelligence is the term used to describe how computers can perform tasks normally viewed as requiring human intelligence such as recognizing speech and objects making decisions based on data and translating languages ai mimics certain operations of the human mindmachine learning is an application of ai in which computers use algorithms rules embodied in software to learn from data and adapt with experiencea neural network is a computer that classifies information putting things into buckets based on their characteristics the hotdog identifying app from hbos silicon valley is an example of one application of this technologysome ai programs train themselves through trial and error for example using a technique called neuroevolution researchers at elon musks openai research center set up an algorithm with policies for getting high scores on atari videogames several hundred copies of these rules were created on different computers with random variations the computers then played the games to learn which policies were most effective and fed those results back into the system ai can also be used to build better ai google is building algorithms that analyze other algorithms to learn which methods are more successfulother ai programs need to be trained by humans feeding them data the ai then derives patterns and rules from that data ai programs trained through machine learning are wellsuited to solve classification problems this basically means calculating the probability that certain information is either of type a or type b for example determining whether a given bear is a panda or a koala is a classification problemthe training starts with showing the computer lots of samples of pandas and koalas these initial samples are called the training set and clearly identify which type of bear is being presented to the aithe ai builds a modela set of rulesto distinguish between pandas and koalas that model might be based on things like size coloring the shape of the ears and what the animal eats bamboo or eucalyptusafter training the ai can be tested with new pandas and koalas to see whether it classifies them correctly if it doesnt do very well the algorithm may need to be tweaked or the training set may need to be expanded to give the ai more data to crunchat this point in its development ai is good at finding items that meet humandefined criteria and detecting patterns in data in other words ai can figure out what makes a panda a panda and what distinguishes it from a koalawhich lets it find the pandas in a collection of random bears these are sometimes called searchandfind type tasksonce its identified something the ai can then apply humandefined rules and take actions in the case of legal work an ai can carry out tasks likeaccording to stefanie yuen thio joint managing partner and head of corporate at tsmp law corp in singapore legal work thats repetitive requiring minimal professional intervention or based on a template will become the sole province of software in addition she saysai can help consumers by providing a form of legal service to clients who might otherwise not be able to afford a lawyer the free service donotpay created by a 19yearold is an aipowered chatbot that lets users contest parking tickets in london and new york in its first 21 months it took on 250000 cases and won 160000 of them saving users more than 4 million worth of fines the same program is helping consumers file databreachrelated suits against equifax for up to 25000though it cant help them litigate their casesaccording to yuen thio ai cant yet replicate advocacy negotiation or structuring of complex deals the new york times suggested that tasks like advising clients writing briefs negotiating deals and appearing in court were beyond the reach of computerization at least for a while ai also isnt yet very good at the type of creative writing in a supreme court brief or a movie scriptlawyers are already using ai to do things like reviewing documents during litigation and due diligence analyzing contracts to determine whether they meet predetermined criteria performing legal research and predicting case outcomesdocument review for litigation involves the task of looking for relevant documentsfor example documents containing specific keywords or emails from ms x to mr y concerning topic z during march 2016 setting search parameters for document review doesnt require ai but using ai improves the speed accuracy and efficiency of document analysisfor example when lawyers using aipowered software for document review flag certain documents as relevant the ai learns what type of documents its supposed to be looking for hence it can more accurately identify other relevant documents this is called predictive coding predictive coding offers many advantages over oldschool manual document review among other things itpredictive coding has been widely accepted as a document review method by us courts since the 2012 decision in da silva moore v publicus groupeclients need to analyze contracts both in bulk and on an individual basisfor example analysis of all contracts a company has signed can identify risks anomalies future financial obligations renewal and expiration dates etc for companies with hundreds or thousands of contracts this can be a slow expensive laborintensive and errorprone process assuming the contracts arent already entered into a robust contract management system its also boring for the lawyers or others tasked with doing iton a daytoday basis lawyers review contracts make comments and redlines and advise clients on whether to sign contracts asis or try to negotiate better terms these contracts can range from simple eg ndas to complex a backlog of contracts to review can create a bottleneck that delays deals and the associated revenues lawyers especially inexperienced ones can miss important issues that can come back to bite their clients laterai can help with both bulk and individual contract reviewat jpmorgan an aipowered program called coin has been used since june 2017 to interpret commercial loan agreements work that previously took 360000 lawyerhours can now be done in seconds the bank is planning to use the technology for other types of legal documents as wellsome ai platforms such as the one provided by kira systems allow lawyers to identify extract and analyze business information contained in large volumes of contract data this is used to create contract summary charts for ma due diligencethe company i work for lawgeex uses ai to analyze contracts one at a time as part of a lawyers daily workflow to start with lawyers set up their lawgeex playbooks by selecting from a list of clauses and variations to require accept or reject for example a california governing law clause might be ok but genovian law isnt then when someone uploads a contract the ai scans it and determines what clauses and variations are present and missing the relevant language is highlighted and marked with a green thumbsup or a red thumbsdown based on the clients preset criteriainhouse lawyers use lawgeex to triage standard agreements like ndas contracts meeting predefined criteria can be preapproved for signature those that dont are kicked to the legal department for further review and revisionany lawyer whos ever done research using lexis or westlaw has used legal automation finding relevant cases in previous eras involving the laborious process of looking up headnote numbers and shepardizing in paper volumes but ai takes research to the next level for example ross intelligence uses the power of ibms watson supercomputer to find similar cases it can even respond to queries in plain english the power of aienabled research is striking using common research methods a bankruptcy lawyer found a case nearly identical to the one he was working on in 10 hours rosss ai found it almost instantlylawyers are often called upon to predict the future if i bring this case how likely is it that ill win and how much will it cost me should i settle this case or take a plea or take my chances at trial more experienced lawyers are often better at making accurate predictions because they have more years of data to work withhowever no lawyer has complete knowledge of all the relevant databecause ai can access more of the relevant data it can be better than lawyers at predicting the outcomes of legal disputes and proceedings and thus helping clients make decisions for example a london law firm used data on the outcomes of 600 cases over 12 months to create a model for the viability of personal injury cases indeed trained on 200 years of supreme court records an ai is already better than many human experts at predicting scotus decisionsa consensus has emerged that ai will significantly disrupt the legal market ai will impact the availability of legal sector jobs the business models of many law firms and how inhouse counsel leverage technologyaccording to deloitte about 100000 legal sector jobs are likely to be automated in the next twenty years deloitte claims 39 of legal jobs can be automated mckinsey global institute estimates that 23 of a lawyers job could be automated some estimates suggest that adopting all legal technology including ai already available now would reduce lawyers hours by 13law firms are notoriously slow to adapt to new technologies enhancing efficiency is often seen as contrary to the economic goal of maximizing billable hours lawyers are also seen as being technophobichowever many law firms are trying to understand and use new legal technologies including ai according to the london times the vast majority of the uk’s top 100 law firms are either using artificial intelligence or assessing the technology firms adopting ai systems include latham watkins baker mckenzie slaughter may and singapores dentons rodyk davidsonron dolin a senior research fellow at harvard law schools center on the legal profession says that traditional law firm business models based on armies of first year associates racking up billable hours doing ma contract review are doomed by the advent of ai this isnt necessarily bad news for junior associatesor at least for the ones who still have jobsas many hated doing contract review in the first placefirms that fail to take advantage of aipowered efficiencies may lag in competing with those who doat least to the extent clients insist on fixedrate billingthus lawyers who understand technology and educate themselves about the latest legaltech developments may be of increasing value to their firmscorporate counsel have obvious reasons to adopt ai unlike attorneys in law firms corporate counsel have no incentive to maximize their hours indeed many lawyers go inhouse to improve their worklife balance which includes getting home at a reasonable hour theyre also often subject to strict budget and headcount constraints so they have to figure out how to get more done with limited resources ai helps inhouse lawyers get home earlier without increasing their departmental budgetsthe aba model rules of professional conduct model rules require that lawyers be competentand that they keep up with new technology as comment 8 statesat least 27 states have adopted some form of this model rule in january of 2017 florida became the first state to require technology training as part of its continuing legal education requirement other states seem likely to follow suit indeed failing to use commonly available technology like email and ediscovery software can be grounds for a malpractice claim or suspension by the barof course aipowered legal automation is not yet common but it soon will bespending on ai is expected to grow rapidlyfrom 8 billion in 2016 to 47 billion in 2020as ai is seen as reducing costs and increasing efficiency top mba programs already have courses on how

strategylike digital transformation before it establishing an enterprise artificial intelligence strategy is so new there is no playbook to crib from and even if a playbook did exist cios would still have to contend with the ongoing proliferation of technology meaning theyd have to customize their investments in ai and plans of action as ai tools evolvethe good news is that early adopters of ai arent operating in a vacuum they can rely on triedandtrue methods for building a new technology competency such as creating a center of excellence by establishing an artificial intelligence center of excellence coe companies can formalize their vision for and approach to aimilind wagle global cio at data center provider equinix inc is just beginning to make a case for an enterprise artificial intelligence strategy hes tapped members of his enterprise architecture team to keep tabs on the market and to uncover potential use cases and his team has also taken on a couple of projects to prove out the value of artificial intelligence investmentsone such project is an internal chatbot embedded into the corporate intranet that helps with things like employee training submitting expense reports and ordering new equipment we call it eva wagle said and its a conversational interface that lets the employee community get answers to a whole bunch of questions in a very contextrich mannerbut these efforts are new and while wagle is optimistic about where artificial intelligence is headed hes found that the technologies for use in the enterprise are still immature right now hes busy setting the groundworkas these technologies mature as we start to get more traction we are going to put some investment behind this in terms of resourcing and governance and create a team around it he said its like any other it capability that you launch if youre getting traction then theres a need to nurture enhance and support it and that will require investment and effortwagle doesnt call this team an artificial intelligence center of excellence but he could centers of excellence are often established to deal with new technologies skills or disciplines that dont fit neatly into the enterprise their aim is to provide governance and to prioritize efforts and they can help companies avoid classic pitfalls such as a tendency to focus on technology rather than use casefor most enterprises its very important that they start from the business perspective said bern elliot an analyst at gartner the artificial intelligence center of excellence is a way to help address the technical needs while also balancing it with the business needswalking the line between shiny new tech and what the business really needs is especially delicate for artificial intelligence its the advances in technology that are propelling the conversation in the first place encouraging companies to focus on possibility rather than concrete business problems but elliot said thats a big mistakeno one does anything with a neural network he said referring to the deep learning technique modeled after the hierarchical arrangement of neurons in biological sensory systems its really the applications of ai that make ai usefulrather than a single artificial intelligence center of excellence elliot teased out three strategic components to consider ai business innovation ai policies and governance and an ai skills center of excellence cios need to keep tabs on all three he saidthe business innovation piece is conducted in consultation with the lines of business to determine what applications and uses cases are most important and how they should be prioritizedthe ai policies and governance piece establishes guidelines on what to watch out for and best practices to follow you will be using data extensively in some cases he said in others you may be exposing the application to customers and you want to make sure its done in the right wayonce a project has been selected companies will need to get their skills house in order thats where the skills center of excellence comes into play the skills coe can include general skills such as data science and data analytics skills as well as aispecific skills such as deep neural networks and natural language understanding the artificial intelligence skills center of excellence is a way to help marshal and manage your skills he saidin many cases a skills team member wont be reassigned to the artificial intelligence skills center of excellence permanently instead team members will participate virtually tapped to help with a project based on how their particular skills applyfinally the skills coe doesnt have to be internal employees only in some cases these are difficult skills to develop elliot said or it may not be in a companys best interest to hire and train employees who leave a couple of years later because their market value is significantly higherthis is a perennial problem when a new technology comes along he said its why companies go to consultants because they get a skills solution provider who comes in and helps complete a project the company can maintain the relationship but they dont have to retain the staffmoiz kohari senior vice president and chief technology architect at state street corp in boston said being fully virtual is key to an artificial intelligence strategy in fact hes pushing back against an artificial intelligence center of excellence precisely because it conjures up the idea of a physical groupas a global company with talent scattered from china to boston and everywhere in between kohari said he finds the physicality of a traditional coe to be shortsighted we find it much more useful to be able to direct the right minds to the right problems he saidhis model is inspired in part by the open source community experts from around the world dont have to be working out of the same room on a project like the linux kernel a unixlike operating system the way it works is you have maintainers of certain areas of the project and you have contributors to that project he said contributors submit code to a githublike environment where its reviewed and accepted before its approved by project maintainers that kind of workflow exists at state streetby giving up the idea of a physical coe state street can think about leadership on a global rather than local scale we find that hiring the best minds wherever they may be is the most beneficial approach for us kohari saidthe company has identified specific technology areas it believes are critical to the financial institutions future including anomaly detection natural language processing and predictive analytics for each technology theyve sought to create a nucleus an expert or a couple of experts who can build a team and oversee projects that address business challenges in these areasthese nuclei are absolute rock stars in their fields im not just saying that kohari said these are guys who arent only contributing to projects but started or were founders of some of those projects he saidstate street supports their nuclei by embedding management talent onto the team to keep track of a projects progress the last thing you want to do is take one of the smartest people who works on anomaly libraries for anomaly detection and burden them with management challenges he saidnicole

comes from the way people communicate voice and text communication provides unbelievable insight into how people engage with one another think and interact metadata – the information about who spoke to who when they spoke and how long they spoke – has always been easy to ascertain but deep analysis of text and voice communication has been a challenge voice is the most challengingvcs and other investors have rewarded twilio’s breakthroughs in voice and text comm analysis with a 38 billion valuation there’s a little risk with this play though the company’s valuation is extremely high – especially for a company that is not wellknown throughout the market but their proprietary technology and its use could make twilio one of the hottest ai stocks in 2018license wikimedia

portfolio if you’re okay with investing in a chinese company – carefully consider their nefarious trackrecord of violating international contract and patent laws – baidu is a great place to startai

must be at the service of all and contribute to international cooperation sustainable development and peace africa is a global priority for unesco and that is why the organization decided to hold its very first important international forum on artificial intelligence in africa from 12 to 13 december 2018 in moroccothe forum’s objective is to enrich the global reflection on artificial intelligence by drawing up a complete inventory of the situation and towards an assessment of an african scale by taking into account challenges opportunities and issues specific to local contexts about 150

confirm that i have read and accepted the terms of use and declaration of consentand artificial intelligence i came away wondering why theyre so far apartboth involve number crunching at their core but while bi is primarily retrospective in nature ai is all about the future the statistical analysis behind bi is primarily about basic counts in contrast with the ultrasophisticated machine learning and deep learning algorithms that underpin aibecause of these differences and the fact that ai as a useful tool is relatively new while bi is yesterdays news we treat the two disciplines as wholly separate during my time at the oreilly ai conference in new york in late june i heard not a single mention of bi conversely at dresner advisory services llcs real business intelligence conference held on the campus of mit in july ai was primarily used as a counterpoint to bi in discussions of the latters strong business value and high adoptionbut speaker mico yuk ceo of consultancy bi brainz in atlanta had an interesting idea im hoping that with more machine learning key performance indicators will grow and evolve she said im hoping we can work on metrics using data science and make kpis work for you rather than you working for themin her vision machine learning algorithms deployed in bi software will tell businesses whats interesting in their historical data right now analysts typically have to define metrics for bi tools to track its a manual process and it only makes visible data the company already knows is importantbut machine learningenabled bi could delve deeper into a business unknown unknowns finding insights in previously unexamined data taken a step further aipowered bi could take advantage of natural language generation capabilities to explain to the business what these insights mean and how they might act on themthis isnt exactly a revolutionary idea bi vendor sisense announced in april a data discovery component to its software that automatically reviews data and alerts users to new and potentially interesting features other vendors are also adding machine learning components to their software analyst firm gartner has been talking about smart data discovery since at least 2015 but it wasnt until this springs magic quadrant report on bi and analytics platforms that gartner declared smart data discovery the next disruptor in the bi software marketthere is some momentum around the idea of combining machine learning business intelligence and artificial intelligence but based on my reporting the idea seems to have seeped little into the general publics consciousness we still mostly see ai and bi as separate domainsthis has to change think of all the time aipowered bi platforms could free up for analysts who currently spend much of their time handling requests for reports they could move on to more effective data science and predictive analytics projects weve seen from companies like uber and google that smart approaches to machine learning can create entirely new profitable business models thats the kind of thing people with strong analytics skills should be spending their time onmaybe once the hype surrounding ai starts to wear off the differences between it and bi will seem smaller and the opportunity more obvious after all were already seeing ai having a big impact on crm hr and fintech software theres no

“there are crazy people out there who believe these claims of extreme danger to humanity they might take people like us as targets” the most pressing threat related to ai in other words might be

minwhat exactly is artificial intelligence and what is the difference between general intelligence and super intelligence can we expect benevolent robots to be walking amongst us in the near future40 years ago today science fiction’s most iconic film was released star wars gave us two of our most beloved onscreen robots though r2d2 and c3po were far more advanced than anything existing then and even now artificial intelligence was already well on its way when the film premiered in fact the father of ai had already designed a test to determine a machine’s intelligence back in 1950 the turing test created by mathematician and computer scientist alan turing asked a judge to field a series of questions to two participants one machine and one human based on the responses the judge would then determine the human responder the computer was deemed intelligent if it was able to fool the judge at least 50 percent of the timesimply put artificial intelligence refers to a machine’s ability to imitate human cognitive abilities like problem solving and learning these skills also require an understanding of language and speech and strategic thinking we already encounter numerous applications of artificial intelligence on a daily basis when we ask siri for directions when driving past google’s autonomous vehicles when we use selfparking or cruise control featureshowever inspired by film and literature many people are more familiar with the concept of artificial general intelligence agi computers would be equally intelligent to humans in every aspect these machines would be capable of performing the same kind of intellectual tasks that humans perform with the same level of success apple’s cofounder steve wozniak developed the coffee test as an indicator for agi during the test a robot has to enter an average home and attempt to make coffee this means finding all the tools figuring out how they operate and then performing the task a robot able to complete this test would be considered an example of agi think c3pobut what about hal 9000 the 2001 a space odyssey horror computer is also still currently the stuff of fiction this field of ai is called artificial superintelligence and it is also the field of research that stephen hawking has warned us about one of ai’s leading figures nick bostrom has defined superintelligence as “an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field including scientific creativity general wisdom and social skills” this slight or vast superiority to human intellect is disconcerting to scientists and laymen because its outcome is unknown a machine capable of constantly learning and improving itself could be unstoppablewhere exactly is ai headed some of the most exciting advancements in ai are a result of selflearning and analytics for examplea study published by nature outlined the work of a team of researchers on “simulated childhood” this is a robot’s ability to detect a malfunction and use a process of trial and error to determine the defect and repair it in a matter of minutes the robots tested could identify a problem and determine the best ways to fix itself the robots could repair 14 forms of damagein 2013 a computer had the intelligence level of a 4year old child in 2014 a computer was able to solve a mathematical problem so complex that the most

expected here are three things every geek who dreamed of a robot future needs to knowdo androids dream of electric sheep thats unclear but i know for sure that every kid dreams of intelligent thinking robots certainly every kid who goes on to work at cnet in any caseas we veer ever closer to the year 2016 my scififuelled childhood fantasies of a bot with a brain the size of a planet are closer than ever to being realised 2015 saw drones taking to the skies while back on the ground artificial intelligence programs are achieving aboveaverage scores on college entrance exams artificial intelligence or ai is the practice of making a machine behave in a practical responsive way its already changing our world and is by my reckoning the most fascinating field of technology right nowbut as one professor i spoke to for this story put it the audacity of the attempt to build an intelligent machine comes with a responsibility to know what were meddling with for everyone who ever thumbed through a copy of i robot mouth agape heres what you need to know about ai in the modern worldmention the phrase killer robot in conversation and youll almost certainly raise a smile your peers doubtless imagining a glowing blue humanoid cyborg sadly pondering what is love before its eyes turn red and it selfdestructs obliterating the northern hemisphereclick here for more stories in cnets most exciting tech seriesdeeply ingrained in modern pop culture is the notion that some manner of ai uprising is on the cards james camerons iconic image of a terminator stamping on a mound of human skulls is never far from any geeks thoughtsthat playful cinematic and deeply poetic cultural artifact belies the very real threat humanity faces however not from killer robots overthrowing their human masters but from intelligent robots following ordersthe immediate threat experts warn comes in the form of autonomous weapons military machines capable of killing without permission from a human from unmanned planes to missile defence systems to sentry robots weve already got military hardware that functions with very little input from a human mindgroups such as the campaign to stop killer robots say were inching ever closer to closing the loop and letting machines handle our killing for us a scenario thats legally pragmatically and of course ethically problematicthe less sensationally named future of life institute recently published an open letter signed by hundreds of ai researchers and famous tech personalities warning if any major military power pushes ahead with ai weapon development a global arms race is virtually inevitable and the endpoint of this technological trajectory is obvious autonomous weapons will become the kalashnikovs of tomorrowthe campaign to stop killer robots a coalition of more than 50 nongovernmental organisations claims its making progress towards a treaty one akin to the international agreement outlawing chemical weapons the un has already hosted discussions on the subject of autonomous murderbots one huge obstacle facing these groups however is that to rave about imminent robot slaughter makes you look like a crackpot whos watched the matrix one too many timeshumanity needs to revise its popcultureinstilled notion that robots becoming selfaware and robots wiping out humanity will occur simultaneously machines that become smart enough to ponder their own existence may certainly be a problem decades down the line but phenomenal advances in ai mean that robots that kill without even being programmed to understand the barest concept of mercy are uncomfortably closeartificial intelligence takes many forms and while weve successfully programmed machines to clean our floors set alarms on our phones park our cars and take out military installations from above the clouds things like introspection and selfawareness are proving a little toughertelling a joke making an ethical judgement deciding that you want to collaborate with some individuals and not others this rich texture of human life isnt there in our machines at all said sir nigel shadbolt professor of computer science at oxford universityfor decades humans have looked forward to the socalled singularity the moment of selfawareness that creates an explosion in selfimproving machine intelligence this will be triggered its presumed by the exponential growth of computing power coupled with advancing software complexityfuturist ray kurzweil predicted in a 2005 book that a model of human intelligence would be achieved as soon as the mid 2020s what appears to be the case now however is that the complexity of our own minds the key that gives rise to consciousness is a lot more well complicated than we imaginedthat spark of awareness in your head we dont know where that comes from shadbolt said the complexity we embody that allows consciousness to happen isnt just by the fact that weve got this kind of cortex this rational brain we have an endocrine system were emotional we have the threelayer brainwe are extraordinarily complex and we have only begun to unpack just a tiny amount of that at this pointits still the hard problem shadbolt said later joking when i ask what the biggest public misconception is concerning ai that its just 10 years down the roadthat sentiment is shared by murray shanahan professor of cognitive robotics at imperial college london who told me the media often gives the impression that humanlevel ai of the sort we see in scifi movies is just around the corner but its almost certainly decades awaytwo of the major problems shanahan explained are endowing computers and robots with a common sense understanding of the everyday world and endowing them with creativity by creativity i dont mean the sort of thing we see in the picassos or einsteins of the world but rather the sort of thing that every child is capable offrom the terminator series to movies such as i robot chappie ex machina and even short circuit the way we portray ai on screen has traditionally been humancentric we tend to imagine a being that essentially looks and acts a lot like a person as ai spreads into every aspect of our life we should be prepared to broaden our horizons when it comes to imagining the bounds and types of intelligence that can be valuable after all weve got plenty of humangrade intelligence alreadythe point cant be just to replicate ourselves shadbolt said weve got very interesting biological ways of doing that so why on earth would we want to do it in siliconfrom the humble roomba to googles animallike selfdriving car siri or neural networks that oversee data centres ai is branching out in ways we couldnt have imagined decades ago if you define intelligence in a way thats more machinecentric professor alan woodward told me last year in an interview on the fading relevance of the turing test youll find some very intelligent machines out there alreadythat diversity in the kinds of ai now emerging may in part come down to the breadth of disciplines currently investigating machine intelligence theres a broad range of subjects now that look at the problem shadbolt said psychologists look at it from a human context there are animal psychologists physiologists neuroscientists ai practitioners all looking at it with a different anglefundamentally well need an interdisciplinary approach so for me there isnt one single discipline that will have all the answersthats the face of modern ai taskcentric wildly diverse intelligent systems essentially mindless for now but busily changing every aspect of human life nonetheless whether its public transport or patrolling the skies the ai of today is nothing like the gloomy glowing cyborg we once pictured its weirder more fascinating more surprising its better than we imaginedfirst black hole image revealed and its the eye of sauron the event horizon telescope captures one of the most powerful objects in

materials relevant to the conversation ai coupled with a virtual voice assistant like amazons alexa for business microsofts cortana google assistant or apples siri could enable natural language data queries for example you could say hey cortana pull up the q4 sales figures and projections for q1 next year if deploying an ai engine to listen to discussions in a meeting or read textbased conversations in a team app the agent could then offer assistance such as would you like me to schedule a task for john to develop budget projections for the new marketing campaignrealtime language translation which enables global workgroups to communicate and collaborate in their native languages and receive native language meeting transcriptions efficient schedules such as calendar systems or meeting applications enabled to automatically schedule future calls based on a projects schedule and availability without individuals having to manually search calendars for availability or worse yet exchange emails to find an appropriate meeting time quicker feedback by integrating chatbots into team applications to enable native language collaboration capabilities such as polling team participants for a status update or providing alerts to team members when the ai engine detects an anomaly in a related business process for example a systems failure could trigger ai tools to create popup messages in the team apps or new conversation channels and it could automatically input relevant datathe ai application could recognize individuals as they enter a meeting room prompting the meeting system to say hi julie i see you have a 400 pm status meeting would you like me to start it this saves time starting audio video and web conferencing bridges as well as retrieving digital whiteboards and shared files it could take attendance by visually or audibly recognizing employees as they join meetings and the ai could use data analytics to help facilities and uc managers gain insight into how meeting spaces are being used how many people are in a typical meeting and how long they use the roomcompliance and security it leaders especially those in regulated industries are likely to be wary about ais access to corporate information and the way that information is stored within ai engines as ai platforms become targets for attack expect to pay closer attention to how that data is protected reliance on cloud the computing power required for ai as well as the need for rapid application evolution typically means that ai platforms are cloudbased and use microservicesbased architectures that leads to data security issues as well the need to ensure that data is stored in accordance with standards like the general data protection regulation business case many of the previously described scenarios are difficult to quantify for enterprises trying to determine return on investment vendors likely will integrate aidriven applications into their current offerings rather than sell separate tools requiring their own licenses or software acquisitions still enterprises will incur costs related to training and it support that they will need to balance with measurable productivity gains and process improvements it leaders will want to ensure that they have the necessary visibility into business processes to help identify benefits to using

'h5': 'contact ussubscriptionscommercial', 'p': 'artificial intelligence throws up a range of legal issues says luis franco of pérezllorcaolga nikonovathe idea of artificial intelligence ‘ai’ has been around since the times of antiquity even if the actual term was coined centuries later at dartmouth college in 1956 certainly we find many examples of thinking machines in ancient myths and in more recent years the literature and film industries have recurrently drawn upon that idea to create all kinds of stories and ultimately that is how many people see ai as an idea bound up with the realm of myths and science fictionhowever this preconception may soon change considering some of the recent developments in this area selfparking cars are already available on the market and according to major car manufacturers’ expectations selfdriven cars will arrive in 5 to 10 years’ time unmanned aircrafts and drones are becoming increasingly common in many fields border control package delivery etc we also have several examples of programmes with certain learning capabilities web ads search engines like google search or apps like siri and viv which use a natural language user interface adapting to the users individual language usage and individual preferences with continuing use and returning individualized resultscertainly the opinion of a significant section of the scientific community seems to be that ai will arrive shortly considering that in the past few months several renowned scientists have emphasized the risks of ai and the need for worldwide regulation on the subject the best example of this is the open letter recently published by the future of life institute “fli” which has been signed by a number of respected scientists including elon musk cofounder of paypal tesla motors and spacex or preeminent astrophysicist dr stephen hawkinsthe letter includes a list of research priorities which put forward several interesting and complex questions requiring an adequate solution we do not presume to have any or all of the answers but we would like to outline some of the most complicated aspects and propose some additional questions to considershort term horizon autonomous systemsconsidering the short term research priorities set out in fli’s letter what we can hope to expect from ai in the near future are increasingly autonomous systems such as selfdriven cars autonomous trading systems more efficient information managing programmes fully automated factories etc from a legal perspective we would be interested in exploring one of its most fundamental aspects which is potential liability in the event of damages caused by an autonomous systemfli’s letter addresses this issue in connection with liability for accidents caused by selfdriven cars although this concern could be extended to drones and other automated vehiclesfirstly who exactly should be taking out the premiums of the obligatory insurance policies associated with the vehicle the ratio legis behind mandatory insurance policies is that a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous and thus its owner must guarantee cover for any damages caused by it however if control over the vehicle is taken from the owner and given to an autonomous system it could be argued that it should be its manufacturer who bears the cost of the insurance policy or perhaps that it should be shared between the manufacturer and the ownera different question would be the actual allocation of liability in the event of an accident assuming that all control over the vehicle is taken away from the driver for lack of a better word how could heshe be held liable for the damages caused in an accident thus we need to explore the potential liability of the manufacturerif the damages were caused due to a faulty design malfunction andor assembly of the vehicle the matter does not present any particular complexity as in such an event it is clear that the manufacturer should be held liablehowever liabilities cannot be so easily allocated if no malfunction is involved in the accident for example if a system which is working properly detects a potential risk but cannot react fast enough current legal doctrine would dictate that no liability should be allocated to the manufacturer if the system was working in accordance with current scientific knowledge and technology and had been approved by the relevant public authorityconsidering the above the standards set by the public authorities in order to approve any given autonomous system will have to be carefully measured in order to set these standards a consideration of paramount importance and great complexity is how a system should ponder the potential risk of causing injury to a person versus the risk of causing economic damagesobviously human life and health should always be prioritised over property damage thus when probabilities are levelled the system should avoid the chance of causing personal injury and assume the risk of causing economic damages however if the probability of causing personal injury is very small the answer might be different indeed if we took the avoidance of risk to humans to extremes we could reach a point where no system would operate since there would always be such a risk however there is a huge grey area in the middle where several factors should be considered in order to set boundaries which would constitute a sorites paradoxof course there are many other questions that autonomous systems will bring up from a legal perspective for example issues related to privacy and security of personal data can autonomous systems share personal data or labourrelated matterslong term sapient selfaware systemsin the long term the questions and challenges will become far more complex and challenging as they will exceed the boundaries of both computer science and laws and will enter into the territory of ethics philosophy and even religion similarly to other highly controversial fields of scientific investigation such as human cloning stem cell research or genetic engineeringif a truly sapient machine could ultimately be created which in view of fli’s letter seems conceivable it will likely be a turning point in human history the potential benefits and indeed risks are immense and a lot of them may probably be far beyond what we currently consider as even remotely possible as will be the questions that will need to be answeredindeed we may have to consider if such sapient machines should have a legal cybernetic personality and whether they could be held liable we may also have to ask ourselves if those machines can own property and have other civil rights or even if they can be actually owned or on the contrary if owning a truly sapient selfaware creature even if an artificial one would be tantamount to slaveryperhaps some of these ideas might seem farfetched and even somewhat shocking however rather than providing any answers these are merely questions that the legal community and other professionals should begin to think aboutnew questionsthe development of artificial intelligence which is likely to speed up in the near future will bring forth new and complex questions to which no legal system in the world has an answer it is therefore necessary for the legal community to begin to consider the answersluis franco is a
