people look at the limitations of today’s ai systems as evidence that agi general ai is a long way off we beg to differ ai has most of agi’s needed pieces already in play they just don’t work together very well — yetthis is a key point as we’ve noted ai is getting better — at least perceptually — by the fact that developers are stringing together several narrow ai platforms but the platforms don’t talk with each other for example while alexa might now be able to start your car it can’t use the current weather conditions to adjust your car’s heater or air conditioning systems or start the defroster to make sure you’re ready to go as soon as you get in but simon argues that we may have the computational and developmental capability either already and don’t know it yet or within the next decadecompanies are spending massive amounts on money on ai right now and as long as they’re willing to spend the billions if not eventually trillions to advance the technology things are going to move quickly but there are all kinds of roadblocks in the way — whether it be a recessionary economy computational challenges and even moral and philosophical hurdles to overcome — so the road to a realworld skynet might be a long onewhile we keep coming back to the obvious skynet references it’s time for a bit of a reality check ais are long strings of programmed responses and collections of

make them sofor example if a predictive ai tells a team that storms will spawn on the east coast next week the team can send resources and warnings there in preparation but if storms actually appear in the gulf of mexico and hit the coast there that prediction was inaccurate and may have endangered lives no one would think the ai is somehow personally to blame for this instead they would look at the various data inputs and algorithm adjustments like other types of software ais remain complex tools for people to useat least for now ai is for the most part harmless and if anything helpful to

possible for machines to learn from experience adjust to new inputs and perform humanlike tasks most ai examples that you hear about today – from chessplaying computers to selfdriving cars – rely heavily on deep learning and natural language processing using these technologies computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks by processing large amounts of data and recognizing patterns in the datathe term artificial intelligence was coined in 1956 but ai has become more popular today thanks to increased data volumes advanced algorithms and improvements in computing power and storageearly ai research in the 1950s explored topics like problem solving and symbolic methods in the 1960s the us department of defense took interest in this type of work and began training computers to mimic basic human reasoning for example the defense advanced research projects agency darpa completed street mapping projects in the 1970s and darpa produced intelligent personal assistants in 2003 long before siri alexa or cortana were household namesthis early work paved the way for the automation and formal reasoning that we see in computers today including decision support systems and smart search systems that can be designed to complement and augment human abilitieswhile hollywood movies and science fiction novels depict ai as humanlike robots that take over the world the current evolution of ai technologies isn’t that scary – or quite that smart instead ai has evolved to provide many specific benefits in every industry keep reading for modern examples of artificial intelligence in health care retail and more1950s–1970sneural networksearly work with neural networks stirs excitement for “thinking machines”1980s–2010smachine learningmachine learning becomes popularpresent daydeep learningdeep learning breakthroughs drive ai boomquick watch this video to understand the relationship between ai and machine learning youll see how these two technologies work with examples and a few funny asidesplus this is a great video to share with friends and family to explain artificial intelligence in a way that anyone will understandpeek inside an aienabled hospital an aiassisted retail store and a predictive analytics system that talks this report from harvard business review examines the ai landscape takes a look at the ai workforce – and explains why you shouldn’t swear at siridata is all around us the internet of things iot and sensors have the ability to harness large volumes of data while artificial intelligence ai can learn patterns in the data to automate tasks for a variety of business benefitsfor ai to be used effectively it’s important that the strategy around it feeds into your larger business strategy always taking into account the convergence of people process and technologyai is helping to embed greater smartness into machines but it is not taking over the world says oliver schabenberger sas executive vice president and chief technology officerevery industry has a high demand for ai capabilities – especially question answering systems that can be used for legal assistance patent searches risk notification and medical research other uses of ai includeai applications can provide personalized medicine and xray readings personal health care assistants can act as life coaches reminding you to take your pills exercise or eat healthierai provides virtual shopping capabilities that offer personalized recommendations and discuss purchase options with the consumer stock management and site layout technologies will also be improved with aiai can analyze factory iot data as it streams from connected equipment to forecast expected load and demand using recurrent networks a specific type of deep learning network used with sequence dataai is used to capture images of game play and provide coaches with reports on how to better organize the game including optimizing field positions and strategyartificial intelligence is not here to replace us it augments our abilities and makes us better at what we do because ai algorithms learn differently than humans they look at things differently they can see relationships and patterns that escape us this human ai partnership offers many opportunities it canartificial intelligence is going to change every industry but we have to understand its limitsthe principle limitation of ai is that it learns from the data there is no other way in which knowledge can be incorporated that means any inaccuracies in the data will be reflected in the results and any additional layers of prediction or analysis have to be added separatelytoday’s ai systems are trained to do a clearly defined task the system that plays poker cannot play solitaire or chess the system that detects fraud cannot drive a car or give you legal advice in fact an ai system that detects health care fraud cannot accurately detect tax fraud or warranty claims fraudin other words these systems are very very specialized they are focused on a single task and are far from behaving like humanslikewise selflearning systems are not autonomous systems the imagined ai technologies that you see in movies and tv are still science fiction but computers that can probe complex data to learn and perfect specific tasks are becoming quite commonai is simplified when you can prepare data for analysis develop models with modern machinelearning algorithms and integrate text analytics all in one product plus you can code projects that combine sas with other languages including python r java or luaai works by combining large amounts of data with fast iterative processing and intelligent algorithms allowing the software to learn automatically from patterns or features in the data ai is a broad field of study that includes many theories methods and technologies as well as the following major subfieldsadditionally several technologies enable and support aiin summary the goal of ai is to provide software that can reason on input and explain on output ai will provide humanlike interactions with software and offer decision support for specific tasks but

essential to set up the system and ask the right questions ai adds intelligence to existing products in most cases ai will not be sold as an individual application rather products you already use will be improved with ai capabilities much like siri was added as a feature to a new generation of apple products automation conversational platforms bots and smart machines can be combined with large amounts of data to improve many technologies at home and in the workplace from security intelligence to investment analysisai adapts through progressive learning algorithms to let the data do the programming ai finds structure and regularities in data so that the algorithm acquires a skill the algorithm becomes a classifier or a predictor so just as the algorithm can teach itself how to play chess it can teach itself what product to recommend next online and the models adapt when given new data back propagation is an ai technique that allows the model to adjust through training and added data when the first answer is not quite rightai analyzes more and deeper data using neural networks that have many hidden layers building a fraud detection system with five hidden layers was almost impossible a few years ago all that has changed with incredible computer power and big data you need lots of data to train deep learning models because they learn directly from the data the more data you can feed them the more accurate they becomeai achieves incredible accuracy through deep neural networks – which was previously impossible for example your interactions with alexa google search and google photos are all based on deep learning – and they keep getting more accurate the more we use them in the medical field ai techniques from deep learning image classification and object recognition can now be used to find cancer on mris with the same accuracy as highly trained radiologistsai gets the most out of data when algorithms are selflearning the data itself can become intellectual property the answers are in the data you just have to apply ai to get them out since the role of the data is now more important than ever before it can create a competitive advantage if you have the best data in a competitive industry even if everyone is applying similar techniques the best data will winbring analytics to industries and domains where it’s currently underutilizedimprove the performance of existing analytic technologies like computer vision and time series analysis break down economic barriers including language and translation barriersaugment existing abilities and make us better at what we do give us better vision better understanding better memory and much moremachine learning automates analytical model building it uses methods from neural networks statistics operations research and physics to find hidden insights in data without explicitly being programmed for where to look or what to concludea neural network is a type of machine learning that is made up of interconnected units like neurons that processes information by responding to external inputs relaying information between each unit the process requires multiple passes at the data to find connections and derive meaning from undefined datadeep learning uses huge neural networks with many layers of processing units taking advantage of advances in computing power and improved training techniques to learn complex patterns in large amounts of data common applications include image and speech recognitioncognitive computing is a subfield of ai that strives for a natural humanlike interaction with machines using ai and cognitive computing the ultimate goal is for a machine to simulate human processes through the ability to interpret images and speech – and then speak coherently in response computer vision relies on pattern recognition and deep learning to recognize what’s in a picture or video when machines can process analyze and understand images they can capture images or videos in real time and interpret their surroundingsnatural language processing nlp is the ability of computers to analyze understand and generate human language including speech the next stage of nlp is natural language interaction which allows humans to communicate with computers using normal everyday language to perform tasksgraphical processing units are key to ai because they provide the heavy compute power that’s required for iterative processing training neural networks requires big data plus compute powerthe internet of things generates massive amounts of data from connected devices most of it unanalyzed automating models with ai will allow us to use more of itadvanced algorithms are being developed and combined in new ways to analyze more data faster and at multiple levels this intelligent processing is key to identifying and predicting rare events understanding complex systems and optimizing unique scenariosapis or application processing interfaces are portable packages of code that make it possible to add ai functionality to existing products and software packages they can add image recognition capabilities to home security systems and qa capabilities that describe data create captions and headlines or call out interesting patterns and insights in dataai in banking survey reveals factors for successwhat do banking executives report about their experiences with ai where are they focusing today what’s working what are their plans for the future what are chatbotschatbots are a form of conversational ai designed to simplify human interaction with computers learn how chatbots are used in business and how they can be incorporated into analytics applications how to drill a better hole with analyticsfrom drilling holes to

and in its use in the development of systems that can reason and respond to increasingly complex situations quite simply ai is everywhere and the change brought about by these technologies has just begun as ai moves from idea to implementation it is clear that future intelligent systems will be designed to partner with rather than replace or even augment human usersstemming from this growth in artificial intelligence technology is an increasing demand for individuals who can create ai systems embedded in practical settings that function alongside and in conjunction with human beingsdrawing on northwestern engineering’s wholebrain philosophy and leadership in cognitive science the master of science in artificial intelligence program aims to serve this demand by producing students who have exceptional technical skills and also understand the nature of the human environments in which the systems they build will be deployed our goal is to educate and train students in all aspects of

it’s a real live person who answers he or she might not be the one deciding how to deal with you instead a complex series of algorithms may step in to gauge your mood and react accordingly one version of ibm’s interactive technology watson assistant instantly analyzes your tone of voice then based on precisely how peeved you sound the system suggests what the service rep should offer as a fix for whatever your problem is—a refund for instance or free shipping on your next order—with the aim of holding on to your businesswondering why a human csr can’t just handle this conversation “people interpret tones of voice differently so they respond differently to customers” explains ibm consultant aman kochhar by contrast he adds “ai is not subjective so it’s much more consistent”kochhar has been learning to apply artificial intelligence to business problems since last december when he started taking ai courses as part of the first phase of a gigantic new training push inside ibm called ai skills academy aisa the program is designed to do two things first it teaches employees about integrating ai into their own jobs within the company from creating marketing apps to improving supply chain efficiency at the same time aisa educates ibmers in consulting sales operations and elsewhere how to collaborate with clients to use ai in their businesses too divided into two tracks—one for techies software developers engineers research scientists and one for everybody else—the curriculum has four levels from basic to expertmore than 2200 ibm staffers have started the training since it launched last year and ibm expects at least 4000 graduates of all four levels in 2019 but says ibm vice president for talent obed louissant that’s just for openers “all of our employees will eventually be trained in ai” moreover aisa continually adds new content in the works right now new courses on making use of ai in project management and general management rolesin one sense it’s only logical that ibm is investing big chunks of its 500 million annual training budget in aisa after all “we build these ai technologies” notes louissant “so we have a responsibility to teach people how to use them both inside and outside the company”okay but aisa also clearly does something else — to wit it makes ibm’s 350000 employees worldwide a lot more desirable to other employers as more companies rely more heavily on data analytics and more jobs call for a working knowledge of ai gartner predicts 23 million new roles worldwide that will require these skills by the end of next yearfor ibm aisa is a calculated risk on the one hand the company has no real choice but to train its workforce in ai but on the other hand helping employees develop precisely the skills most in demand in the outside world right now seems dicey “we did think a lot about this as we developed the program” louissant says adding wryly “we were concerned from the outset about whether we’d be creating a public service”it may work out that way but for now louissant thinks most graduates of ibm’s program will want to stick around he points to the fact that among the roughly 800 people who have already completed aisa training—and who are therefore even more marketable than they were a year ago—attrition so far is lower than for ibm’s workforce overallit’s early days yet of course but that tiny attrition rate may be a reflection of what employees said in detailed surveys about what motivates and engages them even more than money which of course competitors can offer too ibmers say they’re “most interested in keeping up with the cutting edge in technology and continually learning new skills” says louissant “so offering them new training is a retention strategy” in this era of persistent

and even some cons to flip into proslets get started with the advantagesadvantagesnow lets go and see the disadvantagesdisadvantagesthats all in which ai can do amongst advantages and

yqdsyriuhmnnqicaotgluvokslomgchvfcfhnmtblthere are lots of advantages to be mentioned i will start with the fact that kife becomes way easier when ai is involved artificial intelligence has made our life much easier the siri in our smartphones and the gps system we use are of great help like a proper guide gps guides us to our desired destination we are not worried anymore if we miss our way or when we take the wrong route we stay strong with the help of gps ai is also used in smartphones which helps us by guessing the word we are going to type or by automatically correcting our spelling errors we actually do not have to type the entire word but can choose from the options provided artificial intelligence is now been used in almost all fields like medical space exploration mining education fuel fraud detection etc all these have helped mankind a lot and made his life easiernext artificial intelligence is widely used in the medical field as well these machines can give a feedback to the researchers on the side effects of various medicines ai can assist doctors with lengthy medical procedures they can be an assistant as well as a tutor it all depends upon how they are programmed ai is used in recovering patients from depression state and to keep them active these achievements and developments in the medical field with the help of artificial intelligence is highly appreciatablefinally costreduction this is the greatest advantage of artificial intelligence over humans these machines can work continuously without break and rest moreover they need not be paid for whereas the human employees are been paid salary this feature attracts the employers as they can save on the monthly payment machines do not take sick leaves or annual leaves and so on additional expenditures like transportation cost allowances are not required they have no complaints of being overloaded they do not get tired like humans ai is used in decision making and it is capable of thinking fasterspeaking about disadvantages i will mention such aspects as unemployment high costs and not being creative since machines currently lack moral and emotional values valid judgments concerning what is right or wrong cannot be effectively made regarding having the ability to be creative it is true that machines can assist with creating and designing however they cannot match the power of thinking within the human brain as well as the originality present in a creative mindartificial intelligence also known as “ai” for short is revolutionizing our reality improving several fields of vital importance but few people know the true advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligencethere are people who love the benefits of ai including me but there is also the other side of the coin where many people oppose any advancement of such technology what side are you onin this article we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence in our daily lives with detailin the first place there are currently a large number of pros and cons within artificial intelligence however we will list the pro and cons that this robotic intelligence gives usadvantages of artificial intelligence aithe benefits of artificial intelligence are incredible what this area can offer us is to evolve definitively and move on to the history of artificial robots here is a list of the main advantages of artificial intelligence ai in our daily livesimmense organizations will take advantage of this situation because if artificial intelligence brings with it robots that are capable of doing what a person does but even better and faster everything will changecompanies save money in fee payments there will be fewer complaints about absurd work increase and the vacations of employees disappear there are a few advantages of all that exists2 tasks that man could never have donethere are advances that human beings have not been able to make either because it affects the integrity of the researcher or because of lack of technologywe have limitations that robots do not so they can get where we do not such as3 space explorationhere the robots could have great advances the exploration of space would not be a problem for these machinesthe advantages offered by these artificial robots can fall as a ring to mining companies and the possibility of starting the march to find new discoveries of our unknown world4 reach the depth of the earthin the area of mining it is worth mentioning advantages such as safety in the excavation and extraction of fuelin the search for new discoveries on earth it highlights the possibility of examining the ocean and other places where humans have not been able to reach5 prediction of longterm situationsthe selflearning of these algorithms is so incredible that the more you learn in the day to day the more information will reach your database which will lead to an accurate view of possible problems in the future6 less time more effectivenessthe mental process of the human being at times tends to tire the emotions and situation that we live produce that our effectiveness and spirit of doing things in our work get worseif we were to be replaced by artificial intelligence machines none of the previous situations will be decisive in the face of work performancethese systems of artificial intelligence learn in a way that the human cannot and the speeds that reach in fulfilling the functions for which they were programmed the human can never think about overcoming themthey are faster at learning and do not get tired when doing things their speed causes them to do it in less time7 greater probability of successhow are they created to learn over time and automatically share this information with the rest of intelligent prototypes the effectiveness is impressive this is an advantage for medicine and other areas where making a mistake is deadly8 reduction of insecurity and fraudnew forms of network scams or new vulnerabilities to hacking have been constantly seen thanks to artificial intelligence these shortcomings will begin to disappear progressivelythe automated technological minds will go in each attack learning from the enemy and neutralizing in such a way that the more attack the more information of the hacker9 artificial military securityit is no secret to anybody that the great world powers like russia are implementing artificial intelligence to boost their military defense they want to be ready for any threat and robots can be created as analytics of the enemy or as artificial deadly weapons10 radiation detectionit is an important advance in tumor surgeries the precision helps to improve the point where radiation is applied generating success and avoiding damaging the surrounding tissues11 faster and more victorious surgeriesthere are surgeries of an urgent nature speed is paramount and these artificial minds can get to perform surgeries very fast and with total success also artificial intelligence in the not too distant future may seek solutions to cure diseases12 not exhaustedwe all want a staff that does not get tired never complain and that it is economical it is the dream of every entrepreneur the robots came to meet these expectations which until a while ago seemed impossible but we are currently full of cravings waiting for the next creationwith the passage of time more benefits will be developed and more technological advances will appear in artificial intelligencedisadvantages of artificial intelligence aihere is a list of the main disadvantages of artificial intelligence ai in our daily lives1 systems that require a lot of time and moneythe results that we obtain thanks to these technologies are interesting nevertheless reaching such feats costs a lot therefore the capital that these great technologies require can only be achieved by giant corporations or developed countries2 increase in unemploymentthe preferences of corporations for new intelligent robots are increasingly common in fact in the united states increased the rate of unemployment thanks to the organizations decide to change their employees by robotsthe efficiency and speed with which intelligent prototypes work generate a very striking impact on business owners one solution to this is to learn how to create artificial intelligence so you monitor them3 technological dependencyas the advantages accustom us to the comfort and suffixed quality of work we begin unconsciously to depend on these wonderful benefits that this artificial intelligence gives us without taking into account the consequences that this produces4 lack of creativitythe result of an organized and limited algorithm generates a lack of creativity therefore these robots will develop with lack of creative imaginationfor more details read our full article advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligenceartificial intelligence has been around for quite a long time and all of us have been using it either in households or to improve security or to automate daily functions but the technology continues grows and gains more attention today’s ai is more humanlike than ever before we can easily get a virtual “assistant” such as siri or alexa asking specific questions where the technology can answer it for you in such a smart way it just sounds unbelievable so what is next after finding interesting facts about ai and machine learning i can list some pros and consprosconshopefully it will help you to understand the importance and also the threats since ai is improving so fastpros arecons arei also recommend ted talkdaniel paterson gives a good list i think so i’m going to give a different answerthe premisse of the question is that there exists something that is “artificial intelligence” that premisse is questionable all current “ai” is based on digital computers and as such can only be based on huge amounts of classical logic it is not by definition true that huge amounts of classical logic are or can be “intelligent” this depends on your definition of intelligencewhat these huge amounts of logic or smaller amounts of logic working on huge amounts of data can do is produce very useful statistical calculations the outcomes of which look like ‘intelligence’ to us even more so because we are unable to do this ourselves so it looks magical the same is true for computers now playing good chess or go the fact that a computer can outcalculate the intelligence of a human on a logical task is not amazing we humans are actually quite bad at logic and our intelligence is largely not based on it as andy clark wrote “humans are better at frisbee than logic” actually that it requires such a massive amount of digital calculations to outfox a human in logical tasks is testament to the efficiency and power of the human nonlogical techniqueprevious to statistics ai was based on symbolic logic and explicitly coded rules this period failed to produce true intelligence and the hundreds of billions spent on it produced so little that we got a first “winter of ai” when everybody got disillusionedthe statistical methods now being used also cannot produce proper intelligence again depending on your definition but as it does produce a lot of useful tooling eg from computerassisted medical diagnostics to manipulating elections it is not a failure especially when ai is combined with human intelligence which is based on nondiscrete massively parallel but slow ‘estimation’ and not on discrete massively parallel fast ‘calculation’ it is very powerfulso how do you decide if something is intelligent not via the turing test the turing test only measures if it is possible to fool humans that is quite an easy task as humans are quite easily fooledi propose that the best test for an ‘ai’ technique would be if it was able to do as good translation between human languages as specialist humans can as long as the best algorithms with the largest amounts of statistics translate the title of one of my books from ”mastering archimate” to what effectively means “dominating archimate” or that facebook translates “good morning” to “attack them” leading to an arrest then we have a long way to go and my guess is that digital computers will not be able to pass that test for a long time if ever there are reasons to suspect that digital technology never will maybe playing basketballfootball and winning by overpowering humans not physically but mentally would be a good test toobasically the main disadvantage limitations of the current techniques is that they are either ‘brittle’ very sensitive to input or not very reliable ie give results that are ok in maybe 70 of cases eg if you as a company use ai to address your customers and you guess wrong in 30 of the cases you cannot use that technique in situations where being wrong is damaging to your reputation 95 happy customers and 5 very vocal disgruntled customers can be a bad business case even worse in some situations being wrong can be very costly because of your responsibility for the effect class action anyone to manipulate elections on the other hand it is good enough if your targeted facebook or twitter campaigns hit the mark 70 of the time and the others do little harm to your goal let’s quotelife is not mathqmath it is mathrmathand as long as computers are still in mathqmath while reality is mathrmath even an infinite amount of computers will not be able to match realityai helps you understand customer behaviour and expectations and accordingly devise strategies and plans that address their individual needs the biggest disadvantage that comes to my mind is the high cost and the decrease in jobs check out this informative whitepaper for moreadvantages of artificial intelligence· artificial intelligence helps use to handle multidimensional data which have various variety of data types in a dynamic environment· artificial intelligence can be used in various sectors such as banking systems health care financial sectors etc· artificial intelligence helps user to utilize the resource more efficiently by using previous processed data· various social sites such as google and facebook are using artificial intelligence to push relevant advertisements those advertisements are based on users past search behavior· recommended for solving classification and regression problemsdisadvantages of artificial intelligence· no design guidelines accuracy depends on training and learning which is not always available· hard to maintain degree of meaningfulness· hard to combine cases together predictions are limited to the cases that have been observed· required accurate details on many past projects· have large data requirement to learn about various topics which may be time taking and cause various resources', 'ul': 'ai would have a low error rate compared to humans if coded properly

robots or recreate intelligence a gift of nature that shouldnt be recreated this is a discussion about ai thats popular in the daysstorage is expansive but access and retrieval may not lead to

is a possibilityfaster decisions using artificial intelligence decisions can be taken very fastdaily applications in today’s era ai is used in many applications just like apple’s siri window’s cortana google’s ok google using these type of applications we can communicate with our device using our voice which makes our work easyno emotions the complete absence of emotions makes machines to think logically and take right decision where in humans emotions are associated with moods that can affect human efficiencyno breaks unlike humans machines can work 247 without any break hmedical applications increasing the integration of ai tools in every day medical applications could improve the efficiency of treatments and avoid cost by minimizing the risk of false diagnosistaking risks on behalf of humans in various situations robots can be used instead of humans to avoid the riskspublic utilities selfdriving cars which would greatly reduce the number of car crashes facial recognition can be used for security natural language processing to communicate with humans in their languagehigh costs the hardware and software need to get updated with time to meet the latest requirementsunemployment the increasing number of machines leading to unemployment and job security issues as machines are replacing human resources the rate of people losing their jobs will increasecan’t think out of box robots can only do the work that they are programmed to do they cannot act any different outside of whatever algorithm or programming is stored in their internal circuitscan’t feel compassion and sympathy there is no doubt that machines are much better when it comes to working efficiently but they cannot replace the human connection that makes the team machines cannot develop a bond with humanshigh dependence on machines in todays generation most of the people are highly dependent on applications like siri with so much assistance from machine if humans do not need their thinking abilities these abilities will be gradually decrease in future with the heavy use of application of artificial intelligence human may become fully dependent on

vital in placesdiscussing the pros and cons of artificial intelligence is to be sure an emotional topicpeople have feared artificial intelligence ai almost as soon as it was invented hollywood in particular has done a masterful job of stoking those fears with movies like 2001 a space odyssey terminator and the matrix all making ai systems into demonic forcesmost recently renowned scientist stephen hawking told larry king he thought humans and ai could coexist but that a rogue ai could be difficult to stop without appropriate safeguards in place coming from someone like hawking that kind of warning carries some weight with peoplelike any technology there is no inherent good or evil of ai its how its used and implemented people are just projecting their own misuse onto the technology once you look past the foolish fears what you have is a technology that is hard to create easy to control and more of a threat to certain jobs than our overall existenceas a result ai is in the news a lot lately a pilot ai developed by a doctoral graduate from the university of cincinnati trounced a veteran air force pilot in a simulated dogfight every time with decades of dogfighting experiencethe retired colonel told popular science i was surprised at how aware and reactive it was it seemed to be aware of my intentions and reacting instantly to my changes in flight and my missile deployment it

get into the pros and cons of artificial intelligence as described by many people in the fieldonce youve decided to explore ai further weve established the top ai companies so you compare solutions that could fit with your businessai resourcesthe pros of artificial intelligence are numerousmundane tasks humans get bored machines dont let them do the humdrum jobs ai allows for more intricate process automation which increases productivity of resources and takes repetitive boring labor off the shoulders of humans they can focus on creative tasks instead said felicia schneiderhan ceo of 30secondtofly an ai virtual travel assistantfaster actions and decisions ai and cognitive technologies help in making faster actions and decisions areas like automated fraud detection planning and scheduling further demonstrate this benefit said kalyan kumar executive vice president at hcl technologies an it services provider in indiamachine learning big data means datasets in the petabytes far too much for a human to sift through ai can chew through that data as fast as the xeon processors in the servers can go and derive insights from the data much faster than any human couldcloudpassage cofounder and cto carson sweet argues this isn’t actual ai a lot of the big data processing and analysis being attributed to ai is really just the work of machine learning true ai would need to take things so much further toward genuine selflearning using artificial neural networks that emulate the structure and functions of neural networks in human brains he saiderrorfree processing to err is human computers dont the only mistakes they make is when you dont program them properly ai processing will insure errorfree processing of data no matter how large the dataset judgement calls however are a different mattercomputers are stupid but that is their brilliance they demand such a high level of rigor and ai adds quantitative rigor on top of that that to use ai at all you first have to ask yourself the very challenging but stimulating question of what youre trying to do with a new level of acuity said dr nathan wilson cto and cofounder of nara logics synaptic intelligence companytaking the risk aipowered machines are doing jobs humans either cant do or would have to do very carefully space exploration is one of them the mars rover curiosity is an example it is freely roaming mars because it examines the landscape as it explores and determines the best path to take the result is that curiosity is learning to think for itselfbetter research outcomes aibased technologies like computer vision help in achieving better outcomes through improved prediction which can include medical diagnosis oil exploration and demand forecasting said kumarthe cons of artificial intelligence provoke a gutlevel responsejob losses there is no way around it ai will cost lesserskilled people their jobs robots have already taken many jobs on assembly lines and as ai gets better at doing complex tasks even more lowskill jobs will be takenai will create much more wealth than it destroys but it will not be equitably distributed especially at first said wilson driverless cars is one obvious singular tech that will displace millions of human drivers fairly quickly although the recent fatality involving a tesla car on autodrive may have set the whole effort back a bitthe changes will be subliminally felt and not overt said wilson a tax accountant won’t one day receive a pink slip and meet the robot that is now going to sit at her desk rather the next time the tax accountant applies for a job it will be a bit harder to find a joba concentration of power ai could mean a lot of power will be in the hands of a few who are controlling it ai dehumanizes warfare as the nations in possession of advanced ai technology can kill humans without involving an actual human to pull the trigger said schneiderhanbad calls ai does not have the ability to make a judgement call and may never get that ability a really good example happened in sydney australia in 2014 when there was a shooting and hostage drama downtown people began ringing up uber to get out of the affected area and because of the surge in demand in a concentrated area ubers algorithms fell back on the trusted economics of supplyanddemand and ride rates skyrocketedthe uber algorithms didnt take into account the violent crisis impacting downtown and affected riders didnt care they were livid that they had been gouged at a time of crisis it forced uber to reevaluate how it handles such emergencies perhaps in the future it will handle them better but for a few aussies it left a bad taste in their mouthsthere is nothing artificial about intelligence said kartik iyengar senior vice president of iot skylab at virtusapolaris a global it consulting and technology services company intelligence is a fine balance of emotions and skill that is constantly developing today shades of gray exist when we make judgements our behavior is an outcome of the world around us – the more artificial it becomes the more our definitions are subject to deciding on simply right or wrong rather than the quick midcourse corrections that make us human replacing adaptive human behavior with rigid artificial intelligence could cause irrational behavior within ecosystems of people and thingsjudgement calls part 2 the uber situation highlights the fact that unless all such solutions are anticipated and specifically programmed to be out of bounds an ai can arrive at a situation and implement it to the detriment of people or the environment dr tim lynch who has a doctorate in the psychology of computers and intelligent machines calls this perverse instantiationwhat that means is an ai can be programmed with a benign goal but implement it in a perverse manner just because the solution is logical and expeditious so if there is a problem with the food supply an ais solution may be to reduce the population by any means available rather than find ways to increase food production or decrease food waste he saidin short an ultimate pro and con of artificial intelligence ai still isnt all that smartit solutions

and as mit sloan management review’s 2018 global executive study and research report on ai shows pioneer organizations are pulling ahead of their counterparts by deepening their commitment to ai and focusing on revenuegenerating applications over cost savings these early implementers are positioning themselves to reap the benefits of ai at scaleexecutives in companies around the world are increasingly looking to artificial intelligence to create new sources of business value this is especially true for leading adopters of ai — those that have invested in ai initiatives and seen impressive results this small group of companies is doubling down on ai investments building competencies and working to take ai to scale the opportunities and challenges these ai pioneers face are the focus of the 2018 mit sloan management review and the boston consulting group bcg artificial intelligence global executive study and research reportcontinuing last year’s analytical approach our latest research combines a global survey of 3076 business executives and 36 indepth interviews with business executives we classified the organizations surveyed into four groups based on respondents’ responses to questions about their levels of ai adoption and ai understanding pioneers are enterprises that have extensive understanding of ai tools and concepts and significant levels of ai adoption investigators understand ai but have limited adoption experimenters have adopted ai but with limited understanding of it and passives have limited adoption and understanding of aithe research and analysis for this report was conducted under the direction of the authors as part of an mit sloan management review research initiative in collaboration with and sponsored by the boston consulting group and the bcg henderson institutethis report highlights four major patterns in the survey and interview datain addition we conducted a separate survey of 300 executives in china findings from this survey contrast pioneering chinese companies with companies based in other regions chinese ai pioneers are investing more aggressively and report a greater focus on business model transformation however they may be held back by unclear business cases and shortfalls of technical capabilities other striking differences are chinese companies’ larger emphasis on using ai to achieve cost reductions versus revenue enhancements and their greater expectations of job losses due to ai whether china’s approach is successful or not the determination of chinese companies serves as a wakeup call for governments and other companies across the globeoverall the second annual mit sloan management reviewbcg research report tells a story of measurable benefits from current ai initiatives increased investments and determined efforts to expand ai across the enterpriseat allianz the munichbased insurance giant ceo oliver bäte outlined a renewal agenda for the company in 2015 he wanted allianz to energetically pursue higher levels of value creation through the kind of digitalization that he saw transforming economies and economics2 gemma garriga global head of ai and advanced business analytics at allianz says that agenda lit a fire under her group’s efforts to identify new ai applications garriga’s team has since deployed an array of aibased solutions from initial customer personalization to final claims automation she says most of these projects are delivering exciting resultsone improvement came for example when allianz’s underwriting process identified fraud in online insurance applications the problem is that when users provide information there is a possibility that they are not being truthful with the data allianz needs to calculate the right pricing car owners might exaggerate their noclaims bonus level or input a false postcode in order to reduce the cost of the insurance this naturally leads to higher costs for other customers as risks aren’t calculated correctly and distributed fairlyto address that problem garriga’s team developed ai models that calculate in realtime both the probability that an application is accurate — giving it a socalled antifraud underwriting score — as well as the potential future costs of accepting the application the models were put into production about two years ago and promptly “increased fraud detection by around 50” the new system benefits both allianz and its customers by enabling the company to better calculate risks and premiums and more fairly distribute coststhis example illustrates many of the key findings from the mit sloan management reviewbcg 2018 artificial intelligence global executive study and research report as a leader in its informationbased industry allianz though not yet an ai powerhouse is boldly building ai capabilities and determined not to lag behind more aggressive ai adopters such as chinese insurer ping an insurance see the mit smrbcg 2017 artificial intelligence global executive study and research report3we find many companies like allianz ― those experiencing positive outcomes from early ai applications ― are looking to invest even more in their ai efforts the most ambitious of those companies the pioneers have resolved to take their ai advantages to scale pioneers not only believe ai will generate a wide range of opportunities but are creating strategies for prioritizing them and building platforms to encourage ai’s use throughout the enterprise at the same time pioneers are discovering the challenges inherent in the scaling effort they are highly attuned to the workforce implications of corporatewide adoption of ai and the need to lead and manage organizational change they describe their efforts with humility and call it “early days” but they fully expect substantial business value from the implementation of aihas artificial intelligence finally reached the point where it is a practical technology for business use one indication of commercial viability would be if early adopters were not quietly shelving their projects and backing off their investments but instead actively following up with more applications this is precisely what the 2018 research reveals today’s ai pioneers are deepening their ai commitmentssign up now »as an example consider chevron in a joint interview cio bill braun and margery connor chevron fellow at the modeling and analytics center of excellence described an impressive range of ai applications already delivering value at the energy giant ― from diagnosing machinery performance and predicting maintenance needs to strengthening cybersecurity one particularly clever solution uses text analytics to review contracts with subcontractors compare them with invoices and payments and zero in on any “spend leakage”connor’s group scored so many victories that in 2017 it started sending “data science of the month” writeups to chevron’s senior leadership “just like when an executive picks up the magazine on a flight reads something and says ‘hey what are we doing about this’ we’re trying to cause that same reaction widely across the company” says braun it gets more colleagues “connecting the dots” not only to spot more immediate use cases but to see why they should back projects that require more patient investment for example “sensorization and mobility are also going to add a lot of value to us” braun says “but those are a little bit longer plays than just harnessing the power of the data that we already have”pioneers are far more likely to have increased their ai investment levels in the past year suggesting that early initiatives have been encouragingsurvey data reveals the same finding at many other companies asked if they had increased their level of investment in ai in the past year the majority of respondents said yes ― but pioneers were far more likely than others to say they had see figure 1more specifically a significant majority of pioneers reported investing more in the past year than in prior years in ai talent 81 ai technology 86 the data required to train ai algorithms 79 and the processes required to train the algorithms 80 this is not a given by any means pioneers might have just as easily decreased their investment relative to prior years but their results with ai have emboldened them to go furtherhowever compared with last year the actual percentage of pioneers did not grow the excitement around ai notwithstanding the distribution of our survey respondents across the four maturity groups pioneers investigators experimenters and passives in 2018 is comparable to what it was in 2017 in the 20 that are pioneers only the top five percentage points of respondents indicated that they have extensively incorporated ai in processes and offerings ― a result that also remains unchanged from 2017committing to a new technology is as much about learning as it is about investing respondents assessed growth in their understanding of ai over the past year not their current state of understandingthese pioneers however may be pulling further away from their investigating experimenting and passive peers for example in terms of their organization’s understanding of ai over the past year see figure 2 pioneers reported greater growth than other groups whereas enterprises in the passive category reported scant gains on average more than twothirds of pioneers believe their organization has added “a lot” to their ai understanding since 2017an organization can improve its overall understanding of artificial intelligence in many ways direct experience working with ai tools and techniques on actual business problems is one approach another is to hire new people with ai expertise at swiss specialty chemical provider clariant executive committee member britta fuenfstueck says the company has tripled the size of the team working on ai projects providing formal education and training of existing talent is another way to build organizational understanding of ai tassilo festetics vice president of global solutions at anheuserbusch inbev took his entire extended team to the university of california berkeley for a weeklong intensive immersion in ai “it is important for the team to understand the basics of machine learning and ai to be able to identify gamechanging opportunities for the company be it for commercial supply logistics or employeerelated topics” he says “we consider it a longterm investment since this is an investment into capabilities of the future that will be needed in all departments” these approaches to building organizational understanding of ai are complementary and crossfunctionallooking ahead to the next five years a majority of companies expect ai to spur business model changepioneers also differ in their perceptions of whether ai represents opportunity or risk more than any other group pioneers see the opportunity and appear confident that they can reap the benefits before competitors or new entrants do many respondents also expect change in terms of business models — a more exciting prospect than using tools merely to improve performance within existing models see figure 3overall 91 of survey respondents expect new business value from ai implementations in the coming five years even among passives ― which today primarily experience the benefits of aibased products indirectly ― 81 expect to derive value directly from ai within five yearsoverall a surprising number of respondents 28 say ai solutions have already led to business model change in their organization in the case of pioneers a majority make this claim the majority of all organizations 58 foresee modifications of their business models due to ai within five years this is true across all levels of ai maturity and across a variety of industries these results suggest that organizations don’t expect ai to merely help improve current business operations they widely expect ai adoption to change business models what’s more nine out of 10 respondents believe ai will create new value for their business in the next five years see figure 4pioneers are far more likely to see data as a corporate asset and report that data issues are on the agenda of senior managementdata can be the key to success or failure in ai not surprisingly pioneers are more mature than other respondents in their management of this fundamental asset pioneers are more likely than their less sophisticated peers to have strong companywide data governance systems and centralized data lakes their management teams are cognizant of data issues and view data as a corporate asset see figure 5 respondents to the chinese survey centralize data even more see sidebar “china’s big push into ai” committing thoroughly to the application of ai means devoting more attention to data issuesin the spring of 2018 the boston consulting group and mit sloan management review conducted a separate survey of chinese executives in an effort to address other big questions how are companies based in china — home of digital giants alibaba tencent and baidu — progressing in their adoption of ai for business purposes how does their progress compare with companies in other regions to investigate we translated our global survey into chinese and surveyed 300 executives across industries in china for the pioneers we then compared their responses with the nonchinese respondents from our global surveyi three findings are especially noteworthychinese companies are aggressively investing in ai business applications relative to their counterparts in other parts of the world buoyed by the chinese government’s recent fiveyear plan calling for businesses to achieve leadership in artificial intelligence chinese companies report greater increases in ai investment than companies in other regions their approach to data also appears advantageous because ai engines learn by ingesting training data — the more the better — companies should centralize the housing and governance of data and chinese pioneers do this particularly well for example 78 maintain their corporate data in centralized data lakes compared with only 37 and 43 of european and us pioneers respectively and 83 of chinese aileading companies surveyed manage corporate data centrally while only 39 of european pioneers and 40 of us pioneers do sochinese companies face their own challenges in their ambitious push into ai for example nearly half of chinese pioneers say the business case for ai is unclear or missing — a potential impediment to determining appropriate levels of investment the barrier chinese pioneers report most often is a lack of talent in ai nearly six in 10 pioneers in our china sample say constraints in technological talent are holding them back far higher than in the united states and europe chinese companies also report that they are focusing on using ai to cut costs and putting less emphasis on using the technology to generate new revenue streams finally and perhaps as a result of the cost focus they have more peoplerelated concerns and changes more than twothirds of chinese pioneers 68 say ai deployments are likely to reduce the size of their workforce in europe and the united states just 32 and 50 of pioneers respectively share that concernchina’s rapid rise in ai has been a wakeup call for nations industries and corporate executives globally indeed many recent national programs to advance the development of artificial intelligence refer to china as a competitive threatour interviews with individual business executives included numerous discussions of data issues especially in companies that have been in business a long time and grew through mergers and acquisitions while several interviewees noted the “treasure troves” of data they could draw on for ai applications some reported frustration with even simple projects at anheuserbusch inbev for example festetics acknowledges “i wish we would have looked at data quality much earlier we used to spend a large amount of time on getting data and making it ready” but the experience caused the company to change its approach for the better “we felt everything we had was no longer upgradeable so we looked at data from this perspective how would we enable data for analytics if we were to start the company today” he says “this allowed us to make data more readily available to run algorithms to gain insights into consumer preferences optimize our offerings for customers and produce our product with reduced energy and waste”festetics’ comment points to an advantage many pioneers enjoy robust data capabilities consider a large insurance company like allianz or netherlandsbased nationalenederlanden nn group for example4 as ceo of nn group’s home market david knibbe is responsible for about twothirds of the company’s operations which include 18 countries he notes the company started in 1845 “and i’m not saying we have all the data since then but we have enormous amounts of data” as an insurance provider with a strong background in actuarial science the company is more comfortable than many other businesses when it comes to creating models for datadriven decisionmaking the same is true of chevron where subsurface operations have long relied on highperformance computers “back in the early days of the cray supercomputer it was us and the government that were the biggest consumers of cpu” chevron’s braun notes “and for decades that was true” given that chevron engineers and scientists are “really good at applying this kind of technology” he says “letting the machines help with more datadriven decisions ― it’s going to be very natural to them”pioneers also have more top management involvement in and commitment to ai initiatives compared with other groups in identifying the top three barriers to ai adoption in their organization relatively few pioneers said they feel constrained by “lack of leadership support” or an “unclear business case” for airelated efforts see figure 6 as is the case with many business initiatives requiring new investment leadership support and a business case are critical asked to name what spelled the difference between successful and unsuccessful projects he had seen harald rudolph head of daimler strategy didn’t hesitate “next to fostering an understanding of ai throughout the entire organization it is important to get the top management’s attention and make them aware of and excited about the potential of this set of technologies”looking deeper into the data we find that pioneers are the least likely to be held back by a lack of leadership support whether early successes led to that support or conversely leadership support was a critical factor in achieving those first casemaking victories top management attention is another advantage pioneers holdrespondents ranked top barriers to ai adoption in their companies for the second year in a rowwill the pursuit of artificial intelligence prove to be another situation where leading enterprises having established a healthy head start increase the gap between themselves and their less mature peers at the moment this is an open question with rapidly evolving and unfamiliar technology “fastfollowing” might work whereby followers let others forge ahead with experiments and learn from their successes and failures but those hoping to fastfollow others’ pioneering work without taking risks themselves should beware pioneers by deepening their commitments to ai are establishing positions in both customer and labor markets that may make it hard for others to draft off of their hard work the many advantages reported by pioneers suggest that early ai movers may be especially hard to catchnn group’s knibbe is one ceo directing his personal attention to his organization’s ai agenda even in a situation that would distract most ceos — managing a recent major acquisition of delta lloyd group previously one of nn’s main competitors — he stays on top of ai developments “you don’t have the capacity during such a largescale integration to bet on a lot of things” he says but as one of his “big bets” for the combined entity’s future ai remains a personal focus of hislong before ai technology found its way into much practical business use knibbe was confident that it would prove valuable “it is for us very clear that there should be a lot of benefits given where the math and the science already is it seems that all of that is way ahead of business application so i was convinced that there would be a lot of reasons to invest in this whether it’s in process improvements customer analytics customer behavior” nn group’s first smallscale experiments made rapid progress and the company moved ahead with implementing various solutions ― and “what we’ve seen is where we did it it worked well” he saysthe challenge as knibbe sees it now is to take his company’s use of artificial intelligence to scale and in this respect he is typical of many respondents from pioneer companies certain about the promise of ai he wants to go beyond point solutions and pursue ai systemically as an overall source of competitive advantagewhat does scaling require many efforts simultaneously creating a strategic vision taking stock of current capabilities building aisupporting processes and platforms instilling ai understanding into the business and cultivating airelated activities it’s a complex undertaking most executives have yet to consider at a deep level how to scale ai in their business “people don’t really understand what enterprise ai is” says inderpal bhandari global chief data officer at ibm “they do have a good sense of it in the consumer context and they also had a good sense of ai in the context of point solutions like facial recognition and stuff like that but they don’t really understand from an enterprise context exactly what that could look like”pioneers are most likely to see the need for an ai strategy as urgent and have one in place alreadya company cannot successfully deploy ai throughout the enterprise unless management has a strategy pioneers are more likely to recognize the need for such a strategy see figure 7 at daimler for example rudolph says coming up with an ai strategy has been his priority “we are developing clear target pictures for each and every function making sure that they have ambitious but achievable targets and a clear roadmap leading to them” he says having a strategy in place rudolph believes is “the key lever to implement ai technologies to improve existing processes along the entire value chain as well as developing new products and services to delight our customers for us this is of utmost importance”another important step toward managing ai at scale is simply getting a handle on all of the ai activity going on in a sprawling enterprise as an example consider mayo clinic the health care organization has about 65000 employees spread across five us states its operations include major destination medical centers in three different states and the mayo clinic health system which has many practices in a 120mile radius around rochester minnesota there is also the mayo clinic care network an affiliated practice network that spans 50 sites across the country and beyond clark otley md described an ongoing effort by his colleague wyatt decker md an emergency medicine physician who is now ceo of mayo clinic in arizona and leading artificial intelligence efforts across the whole organization “what dr decker is trying to do is catalog and get a handle on all the different efforts that are going on across the institution” otley reports “in the preliminary assessment he collected evidence that there are probably about 250 ongoing artificial intelligence initiatives projects and research programs very disseminated across the entire enterprise” the challenge otley says is to “take an enterprise approach to this so that we develop artificial intelligence in a way that synergizes across our campuses rather than causing redundancy or confusion across the geographic distribution”peter batt it undersecretary at the german federal ministry of the interior explains how his office took stock of where german government agencies are currently leveraging algorithmbased decisionmaking processesthe wideranging feedback was a big surprise to us there are ai applications albeit some are still early stage across many institutions such as the german patent and trade mark office german archaeological institute federal police federal office for information security federal institute of sport science federal statistical office of germany federal criminal police office federal agency for cartography and geodesy federal ministry of justice federal ministry of finance not to mention defense the federal ministry of health robert koch institute and more and the technology is used to improve the service for societygorkem koseoglu global head of robotics and artificial intelligence at dutch bank ing is particularly thoughtful about how the company will take its ai capabilities to scale even as he acknowledges there is a long way to go “for each of these areas gradually we’ll move to more standardized models as a bank obviously we are not a greenfield technology company so we don’t have the luxury to say ‘ok i’m going to go back and work on a universal banking model that will solve everything — and it will take me five years’ but in a typical twospeed process while we are meeting current business needs we at the same time are trying to converge into these core models”what kinds of processes is koseoglu envisioning he says an example is “trying to build what could be the core models when it comes to price — as in what could be the core model that we can use across the segments that will give us the capabilities to do lending pricing for all our customers in a smart way” such models must be built “with the idea that they become our core components of the company and we’ll keep on investing in those as core capabilities” he adds “not as a project but they are basically our core skills and we will dedicate resources to continuously improve them that is the vision we also realize that it’s an evolution”lu hao a former google research scientist and now chief innovation officer at chinese ai innovator yitu technology says that because of yitu’s ai focus a core part of his job is to ensure that all of the infrastructural elements are in place for ai development to proceed smoothly yitu is an exception however it is still rare for companies to have built platforms for their ai application development in the way that aidriven companies have more typical is the situation at spainbased amadeus it group marion mesnage who is in charge of the company’s research innovation and ventures says the company “ultimately wants to standardize ai systems and platforms” to ensure that it is getting the most from its ai investments “it starts with having good data platforms” she notes which is the current focus pioneers are starting to develop standards for what protocols should be used what processes should be followed and how processes should be documentedjoseph sirosh cto of ai in microsoft’s ww commercial business group says the software company is “building a complete ai platform that allows it to build and operate ‘systems of intelligence’ ” the platform includes “components to ingest data to build ai models to deploy them in production to manage them monitor them report on how they are performing using dashboards take in feedback from the actions being taken learn from that and continue that cycle — the iterative learning loop” he says sirosh contends that it is “incredibly important for enterprises to not just look at the first phase of ai which is taking data analyzing it creating predictions using ai methods — which is in fact one of the easier parts of enterprise deployment — but translating that into operational deployment with the ability to debug and test such models in production and the ability to roll back and substitute new models if the older model doesn’t work and so on” for sirosh ai taken to scale means “the enterprise has an aioriented architecture capable of constantly running ai experiments reliably with continuous integration and deployment and then learning from those experiments and continuing to improve its operations”in some organizations one approach to uniting disparate ai activities is to centralize expertise in order to decentralize ai understanding and action a colocated group of professionals welleducated in basic ai technologies can develop and maintain standards and help educate business professionals throughout the organization about ai efforts to scale ai systems and initiatives are more likely to succeed at organizations that are full of people who understand the promise of ai and know something about what effective ai deployments requireseveral business leaders we interviewed described efforts to bring nontechnical employees in the organization to a new level of awareness and enthusiasm at ing koseoglu says “we are investing a lot on the training of the businesspeople because one thing we learned is actually it’s not only about getting more data science resources but more importantly what we call the translators — in our case the product owners” his group is training businesspeople to think about potential use cases for ai and also about the change management that should go along with the solutions they develop “we have a plan to train more than 3000 people in the coming two years in the organization and those may be ― well those are the critical people for scaling up” raphael micha head of corporate strategy development at bosch advocates for “transforming business with ai following a bottomup and topdown approach”at pfizer julie schiffman vice president of business analytics developed the interactive analytics studio which is designed to engage business colleagues in thinking about the potential of ai “we’ve actually taken a conference room and converted it into a lab where we bring crossfunctional teams together to look at data in real time using interactive screens and systems” she explains “what we are finding is that has completely changed the game for how we drive insights across the scientific and commercial community” compared with the traditional “powerpoint culture” she says sessions like these help her team “beat our own cycle time for driving insights by bringing colleagues together in one room from multiple disciplines to review and test initial hypotheses team members develop new questions that we have an opportunity to answer in real time” schiffman believes that this active getupoutofyourchair approach to engagement has helped the pharmaceutical company evolve and make ai and advanced analytics “not as much of a black box” she is convinced that great projects start when her analytics experts sit down with colleagues who have deep business domain experience and good data is brought into the equation that they can review together “when you pull that recipe together” she says “some magic can happen” a common theme among all of these examples is that scaling ai in the enterprise demands new ways to engage business experts with technologyhow should executives prioritize business operations that could be improved with ai judging from our survey results and interviews with business leaders many executives believe their choices are almost unlimited as mayo clinic’s otley puts it “i don’t know that there’s the sweetest spot for artificial intelligence i think it’s going to be broadly applicable across everything we do” survey respondents anticipate opportunities to apply ai to all five functional areas we asked about see figure 8among the highest expectations for ai in the next five years is that it will bring new levels of intelligence to product and service offerings but companies of all sizes also see ways to use ai to enhance internal business processesclariant’s fuenfstueck has a disciplined view about how to prioritize projects when so many operations could benefit from ai’s vast potential with new ai capabilities she says “we are sure that almost everything you can touch you can optimize if you take a process that is very complex but repeats itself all the time and has varying outputs you can always observe which input parameter yields which output and develop machine learning algorithms based on that” so far fuenfstueck claims “almost every topic that the team has touched has benefited” at the same time she is clear on the point that choices about where to use ai must be made strategically in clariant’s case she explains “the team has to touch what they consider to have the highest yield or the highest benefit for putting effort into it”fuenfstueck makes a compelling argument that this highest benefit will come from revenuefocused initiatives rather than in efforts to improve the efficiency of internal processes this is “because any npv net present value of an external business by far outperforms any internal one” she points out that failing to jump on an internal process improvement opportunity means “you just miss out on a year of ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization improvement” a much higher penalty is incurred by missing an opportunity in the external market “if you were late with a new business model somebody else will have driven it and you will have lost your chance forever” fuenfstueck says “so this has to be the rule of prioritization”while clariant first developed its familiarity with ai by applying it to costsaving opportunities — for example by optimizing yields and reducing energy costs in large chemical plant production processes ― fuenfstueck stresses that clariant quickly moved to revenueboosting opportunities with ai among the examples she mentioned are complex pricing applications churn analysis in the customer portfolio new delivery forms that significantly speed up clariant’s ability to meet customer demand and even a new service line operating on a wholly different business model in that second wave of ai projects she says clariant was “taking this knowledge of being able to optimize processes within the company and bringing it now to our customers to help them optimize their processes” creating an ai solution that provides “addon value that allows us to differentiate in a classic chemicalselling business is for us priority no 2” she says an even lower priority is “just bringing something offline to online” for clariant those types of projects aren’t worth devoting scarce resources to “priority no 1” she says is coming up with “completely new business models and really new services just based on digital”in the recent past most businesses have used ai to increase revenues in the future more managers expect ai to reduce costsour survey shows that pioneers and investigators heavily emphasize using ai to develop new revenuegenerating offerings and capabilities in comparison experimenters and passive enterprises focus more on ai applications that reduce costs see figure 9 in the future a larger percent of all maturity groups expect ai to produce cost savingsfor managers in young enterprises or new ventures within old organizations using ai to increase revenues or in the case of social enterprises to achieve their fundamental purpose is an obvious priority they do not have longestablished internal processes that need to be integrated with new ai applications and systems for example in our interviews with theresa johnson product manager at airbnb and yufeng zhang vice president of global business at chinabased horizon robotics there was little mention of resources going to improve the efficiency of legacy processes — few legacy processes exist to improve or consider optel a canadian technology company with a mission to build a sustainable world through smarter supply chains using endtoend traceability systems based on advanced ai optel connects the various segments of the supply chain and provides muchneeded visibility over the path of products in a wide range of industries the company helps fight problems such as counterfeit medicines unsafe or fraudulent food items and unnecessary waste as optel’s president louis roy puts it “for an organization like ours the use of ai is the key to fulfilling our core value proposition to customers and humanity without it we can’t achieve our goal”our survey results and executive interviews suggest that managers recognize both the opportunities as well as the risks of using ai ― to different degrees asked whether they perceive ai as a strategic opportunity or a risk to their organization respondents could choose one answer or the other or both in 2017 83 answered that it was either pure opportunity 50 or a combination of opportunity and risk 33 this year optimism was even higher with 88 giving one of those answers interestingly however there was a six percentage point jump in the subset who saw ai as a mixed blessing 39 this may reflect a dawning recognition that the same ai advantage a company is excited to pursue becomes a risk if a competitor acts faster and deploys first as chevron’s braun says “i think this is one of the most exciting valueadded and competitive parts of our business for the future and so we are passionately going to apply this and use it as part of our differentiation i think it does give us the ability to outcompete but if we are lagging on it it gives our competitors the ability to do that to us”what will be the effects of artificial intelligence on the workplace our survey respondents expect ai will have a large impact on the skills employees will need on the job see figure 10 at the same time they remain cautiously optimistic about ai’s overall effect on the workforceanother year of ai experimentation and learning has left opinions unchanged about workforce impacts — and still sharply divided on the topic of workforce reductionsan overwhelming percentage of respondents 82 believe ai will help their organization improve productivity despite those expectations managers’ opinions about the prospect of labor reductions from airelated productivity improvements are decidedly mixed in fact they are almost exactly evenly split 47 agreed with the statement “our organization’s workforce will be reduced” because of ai in the next five yearssome employees worry that the age of artificial intelligence will mean reductions in the workforce rudolph says daimler takes those concerns seriously and that organizations should take a proactive approach “we are in a very lucky position” he says in that “our company is operating in a global growth industry therefore we are in a much better position to handle any changes on the employment side”rudolph notes that in his strategic role thinking about the company’s use of ai he gets asked “how many people will we have to replace how many will we have to lay off” and he understands that his answer needs to be “not a diplomatic one but a very serious one no one at this point can be entirely sure how ai is influencing the overall workforce new products are being and will be developed demanding new skills and probably also creating new job opportunities we need to look at the processes one by one and understand that artificial intelligence will surely change the way we work but not necessarily lead to workforce reduction”rudolph’s level of uncertainty about the future of any given job at daimler mirrors the survey results overall the uncertainty around workforce reductions results from the clash of two perspectives on one hand past experience with automating technologies might reassure workers that at least at some point the result will be not fewer but rather more job opportunities on the other hand given that machines are already doing knowledge work workers might reasonably doubt that many higherlevel tasks will be left for humans to do in china such skepticism is not uncommonlinda jojo chief digital officer at united airlines summarizes the tension perfectly “history shows that there’s always a fear of new technologies whether it was the word processor or the computer replacing the typewriter through to tablets versus laptops” she says “the result people feared doesn’t tend to happen it’s usually that people just do different and highervalued tasks and jobs supported by the technology or jobs that no one even envisioned because the technology then enabled them i believe that will happen over time but right now that unknown makes it a difficult concept”on the topic of ai’s likely effect on jobs this year’s survey results and the sentiments expressed in our executive interviews are similar to last year’s even with a year of additional experience and understanding about ai these unknown aspects still make it difficult to project forwardhow exactly these effects of ai on the future of work will come together is an important unknown aspect for example while most respondents believe ai will require other existing workers in their organization to change their skill sets in the coming five years relatively few are fearful that ai will take away some of their own tasks in that time frame in fact more than twice as many are hopeful that ai would do so no doubt picturing ai taking over the parts of their jobs that are mundane and repetitive so that they can instead work on more creative tasksthis mix of hope and fear contributes to the uncertainty in roles that involve a healthy dose of both menial and strategic or creative tasks the hope is that ai will take over the menial tasks creating more time to focus on more interesting work garriga of allianz believes “the moment when people realize that this is a productivity gain and that they can focus more on nonmenial valueadding tasks the resistance comes down then it’s a gain and it’s not about ai replacing humans it’s about making people more efficient and letting them focus on the really important tasks for our customers” at the mayo clinic otley says the philosophy is to “automate the easy” and “augment the hard” that is tasks that people find mindnumbingly dull are fair game for ai solutions — but so are tasks they find mindbendingly difficult his strong belief is that humans will still be integral to the work that goes on in medical settings not just in terms of patient care but also to the process of interpreting large masses of dataanalyzing the survey results by job type helps clarify some of the unknowns for example office and operations workers along with business analysts are most likely to agree that “ai will cause us to reduce our workforce within five years” experts and specialists followed by business analysts are most fearful that ai will take over some of their own job tasks according to bonny simi president of jetblue technology ventures the corporate venture arm of the airline this same expectation is driving much investment in ai companies by venture capitalists who are gravitating to enterprise solutions that automate the kinds of repetitive internal work processes that all companies tend to have advancing ai simi is convinced will mean that some people’s jobs go away “you’ll always have controllers and accountants” she allows “but now you won’t have as many data entry people and so on it’s the lowerlevel positions that will be automated and retraining will be needed to upskill workers to fill demand for higherskilled roles”that scenario isn’t hypothetical it is a reality in some organizations at ing for example the deployment of ai applications in the area of backoffice data entry led to the replacement of 400 fulltime employees according to ing’s koseoglu the company taught software how to handle backoffice data entry tasks that the workers and others had been doingthe mit smrbcg 2018 artificial intelligence global executive study and research report makes the case that as a subset of businesses around the world succeed in securing business value from artificial intelligence their pioneering efforts are encouraging them to go further having experimented with point solutions and seen impressive results they now aspire to scale up and build systemic competitive advantages with aitoday companies are taking many approaches to adopting ai christian guttmann executive director of the nordic artificial intelligence institute says he has observed a “huge variation” in how leaders are starting to deal with ai’s opportunities and challenges with highprofile cases driving new levels of enthusiasm the next five years will see increased investments in pursuit of aienabled advantages as a result guttmann sees “enormous need by leaders of large corporations as well as the government entities to make sense of all of this”one way to think about the findings of this report is in terms of what myths the research serves to disprove it may be that some commonly held notions about business uses of ai have outlived their usefulnessmyth the benefits of ai are perpetually just out of reach reality ai is currently providing real value in real organizations not just lab demonstrations in technology organizationsmyth widely available sophisticated ai tools will level the playing field reality pioneers are increasing their investment in ai widening the gap with othersmyth companies that see success with ai flourish via smallscale experiments reality ai leaders are increasing their investments in ai and creating strategies for taking ai to industrial scalemyth the greatest promise of enterprise artificial intelligence is the ability to take mundane knowledge work and automate it yielding unprecedented operational cost savings reality keenly aware of competitive dynamics leaders are applying ai to develop new offerings that focus on revenue creationmyth senior managers view ai as a tool that will help them achieve workforce reductions reality the higher the manager’s role in the corporate hierarchy the less likely he or she will see ai as a cause of job lossesearly ai adopters in business have seen their pioneering efforts rewarded and are pushing forward having gained both competence and greater perspective on the possibilities based on the benefits of early applications we heard great enthusiasm ― but also cleareyed appreciation of the challenges of increasing ai investments and realizing value at scale we also heard many open questions do pioneers already have an unassailable advantage what is the effect of aggressive ai adoption in china on the rest of world how will ai affect economic growth what are the implications of ai on the future of workas chevron’s braun told us “it’s springtime for ai and we’re anticipating a long summer” we look forward to revisiting this research in 2019 and reporting on emerging patternsto understand the challenges and opportunities associated with the use of artificial intelligence in business mit sloan management review in collaboration with the boston consulting group conducted its second annual survey of business executives managers and analysts from organizations around the world which this year included 3076 participantsthe survey conducted in the spring of 2018 captured insights from individuals working in organizations of various sizes spread across 29 industries and located in 126 countries more than twothirds of the respondents were based outside the united states the sample was drawn from a number of sources including mit sloan management review readers and other interested partiesas a starting point for this report’s analysis the total survey population was divided into four subgroups based on the relative ai maturity of respondents’ organizations combining levels of understanding of ai tools and concepts and levels of adoption of ai applications to indicate overall understanding respondents rated their organization’s understanding of nine areas ranging from familiarity with the technological state of the art to challenges of ai application development to organizational behavior implications based on their level of adoption and understanding we divided survey respondents into these four groups“artificial intelligence” is a term that can refer to various technologies it is often used loosely and it can mean different things to people in different groups participants in this study were made aware of the definition of artificial intelligence in the oxford english dictionary “ai is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence such as visual perception speech recognition decisionmaking and translation between languages”to gain context and a deeper understanding of survey findings the research team interviewed 36 executives all of the interviewees are experienced managers representing a variety of industries and types of

varghese samuel ceo fingent', 'ol': 'pioneers are deepening their commitments to ai is ai really taking off in business in one respect the percentage of pioneers among survey respondents remained essentially the same as last year at just under onefifth of those polled yet the level of commitment to ai within the pioneer group is striking fully 88 of pioneers invested more in ai than in the previous year — in contrast to just 62 of experimenters and investigators pioneers continue to push forward pioneers are eager to scale ai throughout their enterprise typically an organization that gained early success with ai did so because some aiknowledgeable managers within a business unit spotted a problem that could be solved more effectively with for example natural language processing attacking such targets in isolation they came up with impressive solutions however these point solutions left enterprises with no greater systemic capabilities than they had before this year’s research highlights a growing ambition in organizations to scale ai for enterpriselevel advantage as ibrahim gokcen chief digital officer at danish shipping company maersk puts it “ai at scale is the next step of digital transformation” but how do you get beyond isolated ai point solutions many companies have discovered often to their surprise that it is easy to apply ai and get quick results what is not so easy is building a system of ai applications along with associated data pipelines that interact and are reliable pioneers overwhelmingly see the need for an ai strategy 85 agree they have an urgent need for an ai strategy and 90 say they have a strategy in place already organizing ai for the entire enterprise requires a strategy pioneers prioritize revenuegenerating applications over costsaving ones which is more important to pursue with ai applications new revenues or cost efficiencies in the first wave of corporate ai adoption many companies focused on making operational processes more efficient easily documented cost savings are a classic way of garnering support for further investment but the finding here is that all but the most passive organizations anticipate ai will pay off most on the revenuegenerating side more sophisticated organizations expect more in this direction as 72 of pioneers say ai will deliver mainly revenue increases in the next five years while only 28 of pioneers expect mainly cost savings for the investigators group the corresponding numbers are 59 and 41 in the near future ai initiatives will focus on generating revenues not cutting costs ai is creating both fear and hope among workers how will ai affect individual workers popular societal debate evokes the specter of smart machines outperforming humans making legions of workers redundant other research has found individuals are evenly divided on the question of whether ai will produce job losses or job gains overall1 our survey echoes the ambivalence 47 say their workforce will be reduced because of ai in the next five years yet a gulf opens when we consider the respondents’ positions in their organizations lowerlevel operational and clerical workers are most concerned that layoffs are imminent perhaps because these workers are less able to influence the course of events and thus feel particularly exposed chief executives are among those least convinced ai adoption will result in more overall job loss only 38 of surveyed ceos expect workforce reductions due to ai the effects of ai on the workforce won’t be uniform managers need to address the concerns of their employees through reskilling change management and communication'})

making intelligent machines especially intelligent computer programs” – according to the father of artificial intelligence john mccarthyartificial intelligence is designing machines that have the ability to think it is the intelligence of machinesthe discussions about the importance of artificial intelligence in our life have gained momentum in recent yearsis it a boon or a bane to the future of human existence is an ongoing debate the very idea to create an artificial intelligence is to make the lives of humans easier researchers of artificial intelligence want to bring in the emotional quotient to the machines along with the general intelligence now as we have got an idea of what is ai artificial intelligence let us have a deeper understanding on things related to it as well philosophy of aiwith the rise of computers the process of doing manual work has been decreased to a great extent now that computers are used almost in every sector humans are highly dependent on itas we are totally surrounded by machines and computer systems this gave humans a general thought like “can a machine think and behave like humans do “ though this was a general thought its curiosity leads to the development of artificial intelligence aiai development has begun with an intention of developing intelligence in machines similar to that of humansgoals of aithe main ai goals are mentioned belowcreating expert systemsthe systems which are mentioned here should have the ability to display intelligent behaviour learn demonstrate explain and provide the users with best advicesimplementing intelligence in machinesthis intends to develop systems which can understand think learn and behave like humanswhat contributes to aias per the definition of ai it is the science and technology which are based on regiments like computer science biology psychology linguistics mathematics and engineeringthe main focus of ai is to bring in advancement to computer functions associated with human intelligence which includes reasoning learning and problemsolvingwhat is ai techniquesome of the weird properties of knowledge in the real world arethe volume is huge beyond

pen or stylus on paper or screen respectively it also understands the letter shapes and will convert it into editable textintelligent robotsrobots are one of the best creation by humans they can do multiple tasks within no time though they cannot be alternate to humans but are very efficient when doing any tasksthey are comprised of sensors which detects few physical data like light heat temperature movement pressure etc just like humans they also possess good processors and huge memorythe best part about these systems is that they are adaptable to the environment around themnow let us look into the pros and cons of artificial intelligence ai advantages ai disadvantages error reduction high cost difficult exploration no replicating humans daily application no improvement with experience digital assistants no original creativity repetitive jobs unemployment medical applications no breaksadvantages of artificial intelligenceartificial intelligence is complex in nature it uses very complicated mixture of computer science mathematics and other complex sciences complex programming helps these machines replicate the cognitive abilities of human beings1 error reductionartificial intelligence helps us in reducing the error and the chance of reaching accuracy with a greater degree of precision is a possibility it is applied in various studies such as exploration of spaceintelligent robots are fed with information and are sent to explore space since they are machines with metal bodies they are more resistant and have greater ability to endure the space and hostile atmospherethey are created and acclimatized in such a way that they cannot be modified or get disfigured or breakdown in the hostile environment2 difficult explorationartificial intelligence and the science of robotics can be put to use in mining and other fuel exploration processes not only that these complex machines can be used for exploring the ocean floor and hence overcome the human limitationsdue to the programming of the robots they can perform more laborious and hard work with greater responsibility moreover they do not wear out easily3 daily applicationcomputed methods for automated reasoning learning and perception have become a common phenomenon in our everyday lives we have our lady siri or cortana to help us outwe are also hitting the road for long drives and trips with the help of gps smartphone in an apt and every day is an example of the how we use artificial intelligence in utilities we find that they can predict what we are going to type and correct the human errors in spelling that is machine intelligence at workwhen we take a picture the artificial intelligence algorithm identifies and detects the person’s face and tags the individuals when we are posting our photographs on the social media sitesartificial intelligence is widely employed by financial institutions and banking institutions to organize and manage data detection of fraud uses artificial intelligence in a smart card based system4 digital assistantshighly advanced organizations use ‘avatars’ which are replicas or digital assistants who can actually interact with the users thus saving the need for human resourcesfor artificial thinkers emotions come in the way of rational thinking and are not a distraction at all the complete absence of the emotional side makes the robots think logically and take the right program decisionsemotions are associated with moods that can cloud judgment and affect human efficiency this is completely ruled out for machine intelligence5 repetitive jobsrepetitive jobs which are monotonous in nature can be carried out with the help of machine intelligence machines think faster than humans and can be put to multitasking machine intelligence can be employed to carry out dangerous tasks their parameters unlike humans can be adjusted their speed and time are calculation based parameters onlywhen humans play a computer game or run a computercontrolled robot we are actually interacting with artificial intelligence in the game we are playing the computer is our opponent the machine intelligence plans the game movement in response to our movements we can consider gaming to be the most common use of the benefits of artificial intelligence6 medical applicationsin the medical field also we will find the wide application of ai doctors assess the patients and their health risks with the help of artificial machine intelligence it educates them about the side effects of various medicinesmedical professionals are often trained with the artificial surgery simulators it finds a huge application in detecting and monitoring neurological disorders as it can simulate the brain functionsrobotics is used often in helping mental health patients to come out of depression and remain active a popular application of artificial intelligence is radiosurgery radiosurgery is used in operating tumours and this can actually help in the operation without damaging the surrounding tissues7 no breaksmachines unlike humans do not require frequent breaks and refreshments they are programmed for long hours and

or a bane to the future of human existence is an ongoing debatethe very idea to create an artificial intelligence is to make the lives of humans easier researchers of artificial intelligence want to bring in the emotional quotient to the machines along with the general intelligencenow as we have got an idea of what is ai artificial intelligence let us have a deeper understanding on things related to it as wellwith the rise of computers the process of doing manual work has been decreased to a great extentnow that computers are used almost in every sector humans are highly dependent on itas we are totally surrounded by machines and computer systems this gave humans a general thought like “can a machine think and behave like humans do “ though this was a general thought its curiosity leads to the development of artificial intelligence aiai development has begun with an intention of developing intelligence in machines similar to that of humansthe main ai goals are mentioned belowthe systems which are mentioned here should have the ability to display intelligent behaviour learn demonstrate explain and provide the users with best advicesthis intends to develop systems which can understand think learn and behave like humansas per the definition of ai it is the science and technology which are based on regiments like computer science biology psychology linguistics mathematics and engineeringthe main focus of ai is to bring in advancement to computer functions associated with human intelligence which includes reasoning learning and problemsolvingsome of the weird properties of knowledge in the real world arethe ai technique is a process to format and uses the knowledge effectivelyartificial intelligence ai has a huge impact on many of the fields and some of them are mentioned belowit plays an important role in strategic games like chess tic tac toe etc here the machine should be able to think of multiple possible steps based on heuristic knowledgeable to communicate with the computers that understand human used natural languagethere are a few applications which incorporate machine programming and some special data to confer thinking and prompting they give clarification and exhortation to the usersthese type of systems are able to understand interpret and grasp visual input on the computerex a spying plane or drone takes pictures which are utilized to make sense of spatial data or guide of the zones and areasyou will find some systems which are able to understand the language which is used by humans and talk to them they can even understand the slang background noise accent etcthis special software will be able to read the text written either by a pen or stylus on paper or screen respectively it also understands the letter shapes and will convert it into editable textrobots are one of the best creation by humans they can do multiple tasks within no time though they cannot be alternate to humans but are very efficient when doing any tasksthey are comprised of sensors which detects few physical data like light heat temperature movement pressure etc just like humans they also possess good processors and huge memorythe best part about these systems is that they are adaptable to the environment around themnow let us look into the pros and cons of artificial intelligenceai advantages ai disadvantages error reduction high cost difficult exploration no replicating humans daily application no improvement with experience digital assistants no original creativity repetitive jobs unemployment medical applications no breaksadvantages of artificial intelligenceartificial intelligence is complex in nature it uses very complicated mixture of computer science mathematics and other complex sciences complex programming helps these machines replicate the cognitive abilities of human beings1 error reductionartificial intelligence helps us in reducing the error and the chance of reaching accuracy with a greater degree of precision is a possibility it is applied in various studies such as exploration of spaceintelligent robots are fed with information and are sent to explore space since they are machines with metal bodies they are more resistant and have greater ability to endure the space and hostile atmospherethey are created and acclimatized in such a way that they cannot be modified or get disfigured or breakdown in the hostile environment2 difficult explorationartificial intelligence and the science of robotics can be put to use in mining and other fuel exploration processes not only that these complex machines can be used for exploring the ocean floor and hence overcome the human limitationsdue to the programming of the robots they can perform more laborious and hard work with greater responsibility moreover they do not wear out easily3 daily applicationcomputed methods for automated reasoning learning and perception have become a common phenomenon in our everyday lives we have our lady siri or cortana to help us outwe are also hitting the road for long drives and trips with the help of gps smartphone in an apt and every day is an example of the how we use artificial intelligence in utilities we find that they can predict what we are going to type and correct the human errors in spelling that is machine intelligence at workwhen we take a picture the artificial intelligence algorithm identifies and detects the person’s face and tags the individuals when we are posting our photographs on the social media sitesartificial intelligence is widely employed by financial institutions and banking institutions to organize and manage data detection of fraud uses artificial intelligence in a smart card based system4 digital assistantshighly advanced organizations use ‘avatars’ which are replicas or digital assistants who can actually interact with the users thus saving the need for human resourcesfor artificial thinkers emotions come in the way of rational thinking and are not a distraction at all the complete absence of the emotional side makes the robots think logically and take the right program decisionsemotions are associated with moods that can cloud judgment and affect human efficiency this is completely ruled out for machine intelligence5 repetitive jobsrepetitive jobs which are monotonous in nature can be carried out with the help of machine intelligence machines think faster than humans and can be put to multitasking machine intelligence can be employed to carry out dangerous tasks their parameters unlike humans can be adjusted their speed and time are calculation based parameters onlywhen humans play a computer game or run a computercontrolled robot we are actually interacting with artificial intelligence in the game we are playing the computer is our opponent the machine intelligence plans the game movement in response to our movements we can consider gaming to be the most common use of the benefits of artificial intelligence6 medical applicationsin the medical field also we will find the wide application of ai doctors assess the patients and their health risks with the help of artificial machine intelligence it educates them about the side effects of various medicinesmedical professionals are often trained with the artificial surgery simulators it finds a huge application in detecting and monitoring neurological disorders as it can simulate the brain functionsrobotics is used often in helping mental health patients to come out of depression and remain active a popular application of

making intelligent machines especially intelligent computer programs” – according to the father of artificial intelligence john mccarthyartificial intelligence is designing machines that have the ability to think it is the intelligence of machinesthe discussions about the importance of artificial intelligence in our life have gained momentum in recent yearsis it a boon or a bane to the future of human existence is an ongoing debate the very idea to create an artificial intelligence is to make the lives of humans easier researchers of artificial intelligence want to bring in the emotional quotient to the machines along with the general intelligence now as we have got an idea of what is ai artificial intelligence let us have a deeper understanding on things related to it as well philosophy of aiwith the rise of computers the process of doing manual work has been decreased to a great extent now that computers are used almost in every sector humans are highly dependent on itas we are totally surrounded by machines and computer systems this gave humans a general thought like “can a machine think and behave like humans do “ though this was a general thought its curiosity

pen or stylus on paper or screen respectively it also understands the letter shapes and will convert it into editable textintelligent robotsrobots are one of the best creation by humans they can do multiple tasks within no time though they cannot be alternate to humans but are very efficient when doing any tasksthey are comprised of sensors which detects few physical data like light heat temperature movement pressure etc just like humans they also possess good processors and huge memorythe best part about these systems is that they are adaptable to the environment around themnow let us look into the pros and cons of artificial intelligence ai advantages ai disadvantages error reduction high cost difficult exploration no replicating humans daily application no improvement with experience digital assistants no original creativity repetitive jobs unemployment medical applications no breaksadvantages of artificial intelligenceartificial intelligence is complex in nature it uses very complicated mixture of computer science mathematics and other complex sciences complex programming helps these machines replicate the cognitive abilities of human beings1 error reductionartificial intelligence helps us in reducing the error and the chance of reaching accuracy with a greater degree of precision is a possibility it is applied in various studies such as exploration of spaceintelligent robots are fed with information and are sent to explore space since they are machines with metal bodies they are more resistant and have greater ability to endure the space and hostile atmospherethey are created and acclimatized in such a way that they cannot be modified or get disfigured or breakdown in the hostile environment2 difficult explorationartificial intelligence and the science of robotics can be put to use in mining and other fuel exploration processes not only that these complex machines can be used for exploring the ocean floor and hence overcome the human limitationsdue to the programming of the robots they can perform more laborious and hard work with greater responsibility moreover they do not wear out easily3 daily applicationcomputed methods for automated reasoning learning and perception have become a common phenomenon in our everyday lives we have our lady siri or cortana to help us outwe are also hitting the road for long drives and trips with the help of gps smartphone in an apt and every day is an example of the how we use artificial intelligence in utilities we find that they can predict what we are going to type and correct the human errors in spelling that is machine intelligence at workwhen we take a picture the artificial intelligence algorithm identifies and detects the person’s face and tags the individuals when we are posting our photographs on the social media sitesartificial intelligence is widely employed by financial institutions and banking institutions to organize and manage data detection of fraud uses artificial intelligence in a smart card based system4 digital assistantshighly advanced organizations use ‘avatars’ which are replicas or digital assistants who can actually interact with the users thus saving the need for human resourcesfor artificial thinkers emotions come in the way of rational thinking and are not a distraction at all the complete absence of the emotional side makes the robots think logically and take the right program decisionsemotions are associated with moods that can cloud judgment and affect human efficiency this is completely ruled out for machine intelligence5 repetitive jobsrepetitive jobs which are monotonous in nature can be carried out with the help of machine intelligence machines think faster than humans and can be put to multitasking machine intelligence can be employed to carry out dangerous tasks their parameters unlike humans can be adjusted their speed and time are calculation based parameters onlywhen humans play a computer game or run a computercontrolled robot we are actually interacting with artificial intelligence in the game we are playing the computer is our opponent the machine intelligence plans the game movement in response to our movements we can consider gaming to be the most common use of the benefits of artificial intelligence6 medical applicationsin the medical field also we will find the wide application of ai doctors assess the patients and their health risks with the help of artificial machine intelligence it educates them about the side effects of various medicinesmedical professionals are often trained with the artificial surgery simulators it finds a huge application in detecting and monitoring neurological disorders as it can simulate the brain functionsrobotics is used often in helping mental health patients to come out of depression and remain active a popular application of artificial intelligence is radiosurgery radiosurgery is used in operating tumours and this can actually help in the operation without damaging the surrounding tissues7 no breaksmachines unlike humans do not require frequent breaks and refreshments they are programmed for long hours and can continuously perform without getting bored or distracted or even tireddisadvantages of artificial intelligence1 high costcreation of artificial intelligence requires huge costs as they are very complex machines their repair and maintenance require huge coststhey have software programs which need frequent up gradation to cater to the needs of the changing environment and the need for the machines to be smarter by the dayin the case of severe breakdowns the procedure to recover lost codes and reinstating the system might require huge time and cost2 no replicating humansintelligence is believed to be a gift of nature an ethical argument continues whether human intelligence is to be replicated or notmachines do not have any emotions and moral values they perform what is programmed and cannot make the judgment of right or wrong even cannot take decisions if they encounter a situation unfamiliar to them they either perform incorrectly or breakdown in such situations3 no improvement with experienceunlike humans artificial intelligence cannot be improved with experience with time it can lead to wear and tear it stores a lot of data but the way it can be accessed and used is very different from human intelligencemachines are unable to alter their responses to changing environments we are constantly bombarded by the question whether it is really exciting to replace humans with machinesin the world of artificial intelligence there is nothing like working with a whole heart or passionately care or concerns are not present in the machine intelligence dictionary there is no sense of belonging or togetherness or a human touch they fail to distinguish between a hardworking individual and an inefficient individual4 no original creativitydo you want creativity or imaginationthese are not the forte of artificial intelligence while they can help you design and create they are no match for the power of thinking that the human brain has or even the originality of a creative mindhuman beings are highly sensitive and emotional intellectuals they see hear think and feel their thoughts are guided by the feelings which completely lacks in machines the inherent intuitive abilities of the human brain cannot be replicated5 unemploymentreplacement of humans with machines can lead to largescale unemploymentunemployment is a socially undesirable phenomenon people with nothing to do can lead to the destructive use of their creative mindshumans can unnecessarily be highly dependent on the machines if the use of artificial intelligence becomes rampant they will lose their creative power and will become lazy also if humans start thinking in a destructive way they can create havoc with these machinesartificial intelligence in wrong hands is a serious threat to mankind in general it may lead to mass destruction also there is a constant fear of machines taking over or superseding the humansbased on the above discussion the association for the advancement of artificial intelligence has two objectives – to develop and advance the science of artificial intelligence and to promote and educate about the responsible usage of artificial intelligenceidentifying and studying the risk of artificial intelligence is a very important task at hand this can help in resolving the issues at hand programming errors or cyber attacks need more dedicated and careful research technology companies and technology industry as a whole needs to pay more attention to the quality of the software everything that has been created in this world and in our individual societies is the continuous result of intelligenceartificial intelligence augments and empowers human intelligence so as long we are successful in keeping technology beneficial we will be able to help this human civilizationeverything that has been created in this world and in our individual societies is the continuous result of intelligence artificial intelligence augments and empowers human intelligence so as long we are successful in keeping technology beneficial we will be able to help this human civilizationai safety researchin the recent times and in the near future the need of having beneficial effects of artificial intelligence on the society has motivated research in many areas like security or control to nontechnical topics like economics and lawwhile laptop crash might be a little trouble but this is a highly undesirable event if it is an aeroplane autopilot software malfunction or a lapse on your trading terminal or even your power grid monitoringlethal autonomous weapons are also a product of artificial intelligence and the near future challenge is to control the samecreating artificial intelligence is perhaps the biggest event for mankind if used and developed constructively we can use artificial intelligence to eradicate poverty and hunger from the human racethe argument that will we ever achieve that supreme level of artificial ever is onthe creators and perpetrators of artificial intelligence insist that machine intelligence is beneficial and has been created to help the human racethe power of artificial intelligence that unintentionally causes destruction and damage cannot be ignored what will help us control it better is research and indepth study of the importance of artificial intelligenceresearch alone can control the potentially harmful consequences of ai and help us enjoy the fruit of this innovation computer scientist petercomputer scientist peter abbael of the university of california says “that robots will be able to keep us much safer from destruction in near future” it will help us in taking care of the old without tiring out and hence human beings will enjoy independence for a longer period he predicts that ai can help us in drastically reducing traffic accidents it can bring such incidents to zero if developed properlyshimon whiteson believes that man and computer are not separate they are in fact a single cognitive unityoky matsuoka has a unique example of ai benefit suppose a human being loses a limb now he has been given an artificial limb just imagine the wonders ai can do to the person if the limb can be operated through machine intelligence things that the human being is not able to perform on his own anymore are performed by the machine intelligence and he is able to enjoy the fruits as if he is performing the act wonderful isn’t itthomas dietterich is absolutely fascinated by the idea of the combination of human and artificial intelligence he believes that machine intelligence in future can give us augmented sensory abilities like extended vision or ability to hear and he also coined a term ‘exoskeleton’ as per him this will help us to walk around even when our bones are weak when we are old your eyes and ears fail you but ai helps you to continue to hear and seestuart russell believes that all the problems that we encounter including that of climate change can be addressed with the help of artificial intelligence artificial intelligence magnifies the human intelligence and it can only take this human civilization forward and not backward it can predict an environmental catastrophe and help us act fast cure a disease or even help us eliminate poverty“the sky is the limit” – says oren etzioni ceo of allen institute of artificial intelligence everything that human beings have contemplated starting from space exploration to finding a solution to the deadly ebola could have been more documented and tractable with the impact of artificial intelligence ai will document the footprints of human developmentsai and robotics will not only improve the way we think or live our lives but also explores new horizons whether space or the ocean as the age old saying goes the need is the mother of all innovations so it is with ai also humans are getting increasingly better in defining their wants and quickly transforming this want into reality things will happen

convert it into editable textrobots are one of the best creation by humans they can do multiple tasks within no time though they cannot be alternate to humans but are very efficient when doing any tasksthey are comprised of sensors which detects few physical data like light heat temperature movement pressure etc just like humans they also possess good processors and huge memorythe best part about these systems is that they are adaptable to the environment around themnow let us look into the pros and cons of artificial intelligenceai advantages ai disadvantages error reduction high cost difficult exploration no replicating humans daily application no improvement with experience digital assistants no original creativity repetitive jobs unemployment medical applications no breaksadvantages of artificial intelligenceartificial intelligence is complex in nature it uses very complicated mixture of computer science mathematics and other complex sciences complex programming helps these machines replicate the cognitive abilities of human beings1 error reductionartificial intelligence helps us in reducing the error and the chance of reaching accuracy with a greater degree of precision is a possibility it is applied in various studies such as exploration of spaceintelligent robots are fed with information and are sent to explore space since they are machines with metal bodies they are more resistant and have greater ability to endure the space and hostile atmospherethey are created and acclimatized in such a way that they cannot be modified or get disfigured or breakdown in the hostile environment2 difficult explorationartificial intelligence and the science of robotics can be put to use in mining and other fuel exploration processes not only that these complex machines can be used for exploring the ocean floor and hence overcome the human limitationsdue to the programming of the robots they can perform more laborious and hard work with greater responsibility moreover they do not wear out easily3 daily applicationcomputed methods for automated reasoning learning and perception have become a common phenomenon in our everyday lives we have our lady siri or cortana to help us outwe are also hitting the road for long drives and trips with the help of gps smartphone in an apt and every day is an example of the how we use artificial intelligence in utilities we find that they can predict what we are going to type and correct the human errors in spelling that is machine intelligence at workwhen we take a picture the artificial intelligence algorithm identifies and detects the person’s face and tags the individuals when we are posting our photographs on the social media sitesartificial intelligence is widely employed by financial institutions and banking institutions to organize and manage data detection of fraud uses artificial intelligence in a smart card based system4 digital assistantshighly advanced organizations use ‘avatars’ which are replicas or digital assistants who can actually interact with the users thus saving the need for human resourcesfor artificial thinkers emotions come in the way of rational thinking and are not a distraction at all the complete absence of the emotional side makes the robots think logically and take the right program decisionsemotions are associated with moods that can cloud judgment and affect human efficiency this is completely ruled out for machine intelligence5 repetitive jobsrepetitive jobs which are monotonous in nature can be carried out with the help of machine intelligence machines think faster than humans and can be put to multitasking machine intelligence can be employed to carry out dangerous tasks their parameters unlike humans can be adjusted their speed and time are calculation based parameters onlywhen humans play a computer game or run a computercontrolled robot we are actually interacting with artificial intelligence in the game we are playing the computer is our opponent the machine intelligence plans the game movement in response to our movements we can consider gaming to be the most common use of the benefits of artificial intelligence6 medical applicationsin the medical field also we will find the wide application of ai doctors assess the patients and their health risks with the help of artificial machine intelligence it educates them about the side effects of various medicinesmedical professionals are often trained with the artificial surgery simulators it finds a huge application in detecting and monitoring neurological disorders as it can simulate the brain functionsrobotics is used often in helping mental health patients to come out of depression and remain active a popular application of artificial intelligence is radiosurgery radiosurgery is used in operating tumours and this can actually help in the operation without damaging the surrounding tissues7 no breaksmachines unlike humans do not require frequent breaks and refreshments they are programmed for long hours and can continuously perform without getting bored or distracted or even tireddisadvantages of artificial intelligence1 high costcreation of artificial intelligence requires huge costs as they are very complex machines their repair and maintenance require huge coststhey have software programs which need frequent up gradation to cater to the needs of the changing environment and the need for the machines to be smarter by the dayin the case of severe breakdowns the procedure to recover lost codes and reinstating the system might require huge time and cost2 no replicating humansintelligence is believed to be a gift of nature an ethical argument continues whether human intelligence is to be replicated or notmachines do not have any emotions and moral values they perform what is programmed and cannot make the judgment of right or wrong even cannot take decisions if they encounter a situation unfamiliar to them they either perform incorrectly or breakdown in such situations3 no improvement with experienceunlike humans artificial intelligence cannot be improved with experience with time it can lead to wear and tear it stores a lot of data but the way it can be accessed and used is very different from human intelligencemachines are unable to alter their responses to changing environments we are constantly bombarded by the question whether it is really exciting to replace humans with machinesin the world of artificial intelligence there is nothing like working with a whole heart or passionately care or concerns are not present in the machine intelligence dictionary there is no sense of belonging or togetherness or a human touch they fail to distinguish between a hardworking individual and an inefficient individual4 no original creativitydo you want creativity or imaginationthese are not the forte of artificial intelligence while they can help you design and create they are no match for the power of thinking that the human brain has or even the originality of a creative mindhuman beings are highly sensitive and emotional intellectuals they see hear think and feel their thoughts are guided by the feelings which completely lacks in machines the inherent intuitive abilities of the human brain cannot be replicated5 unemploymentreplacement of humans with machines can lead to largescale unemploymentunemployment is a socially undesirable phenomenon people with nothing to do can lead to the destructive use of their creative mindshumans can unnecessarily be highly dependent on the machines if the use of artificial intelligence becomes rampant they will lose their creative power and will become lazy also if humans start thinking in a destructive way they can create havoc with these machinesartificial intelligence in wrong hands is a serious threat to mankind in general it may lead to mass destruction also there is a constant fear of machines taking over or superseding the humansbased on the above discussion the association for the advancement of artificial intelligence has two objectives – to develop and advance the science of artificial intelligence and to promote and educate about the responsible usage of artificial intelligenceidentifying and studying the risk of artificial intelligence is a very important task at hand this can

combination of human and artificial intelligence he believes that machine intelligence in future can give us augmented sensory abilities like extended vision or ability to hear and he also coined a term ‘exoskeleton’ as per him this will help us to walk around even when our bones are weak when we are old your eyes and ears fail you but ai helps you to continue to hear and seestuart russell believes that all the problems that we encounter including that of climate change can be addressed with the help of artificial intelligence artificial intelligence magnifies the human intelligence and

artificial intelligence over the years hollywood has been using this topic to make movies now the question arises what exactly is artificial intelligence according to merriam webster “artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science which deals with simulating the intelligent behavior in computers” this means that an artificially intelligent machine behaves like a human being according to britannica alan turing who was a british mathematician started working on artificial intelligencerecently there was a speech at the artificial intelligence and the singularity conference in oakland california there was a great lineup of speakers including ai experts peter voss and monica anderson new york university professor gary marcus scifi writer nicole sallak anderson and futurist scott jackisch all of us are interested in how the creation of artificial intelligence will affect the world the topic was “the morality of an artificial intelligence will be different from our humanartificial intelligence artificial intelligence once something that people thought could only come out of science fiction novels and movies but today that could all change because of a robot called cog cog is an artificial intelligence that it’s creators have given a body he is the future of ai and a new beginning for the field his creator rogney brooks a professor of electrical engineering and computer science thought of creating cog from inspiration from an artificial intelligencefor years artificial intelligence has posed the question what it means to be human and more specifically the nature of consciousness when confronted with the issue of the relationship between the mind and the body the most likely argument is that both exist independently of each other but have a twoway relationship however recent advancements in machine learning the technical algorithms that make up artificial intelligence have suggested that this is not true it is important to exploreartificial intelligence cognitive ability or information processing computers have become an integral part of our everyday lives we rely upon these machines to perform innumerable tasks that we often take for granted most people realize that computers are able to perform the multitude of functions as a consequence of the programming they receive these programs give computers a set of instructions that governs their transition from one information processing state to another thus computationallanguages and artificial intelligence artificial intelligence artificial intelligence can be defined as the theory that a technological system such as computers are able to independently perform tasks that would normally require the operation of a human being to achieve the primary goal of an artificial intelligence system in a machine is to autonomously make decisions based on its perceived environment and efficiently complete a range of given tasks artificial intelligence in all forms seekscentury artificial intelligence is one part of computer science involved with making computers behave like humans vangie beal 2015 moreover the artificial intelligence has scope very widely

humanrobotartificial intelligence ai is portrayed in many science fiction films such as i robot the terminator ex machina etc or novels as the future that holds evil in our society engineers all over the world are currently developing and making ai a reality i know that my major is involved with the project intending to bring ai into reality which is interesting but it still has me wondering if this is a good idea i imagine ai as the future such that we will have them at school in our houseartificial intelligence in missile technology kmanasa btech iiiiv branch eee shadan college of engg tech peerancheru hyderabad08 kondasowmya yahoocom abstract the development strength economy and progress depends on the status of the defence this paper deals with various generations of computer where the fifth generation computers use artificial intelligence a few applications of artificial intelligence used in various technologies have also been discussed the main focus of paperbecame sentient as computing became more and more complex and memory and advances in computer chip technology increased the study of artificial intelligence and the idea of what might be possible for computers has also undergone a dramatic evolution in fact many contemporary computing applications at home in vehicles and in business already use artificial intelligence ai as a basis for many operations many of todays machines are designed to perform a specific task and function modern manufacturinginformation does not making a single being intelligence understanding and using some of amount of cognition does searle newell and simon agree that computers and artificial intelligence can be excellent tools to study cognition in humans however they disagree on the grounds of artificial intelligence having the capability to have cognitive function according to newell and simon a computer is significantly different than a being of artificial intelligence in their perspectives since the waymentally as this interaction was at an alltime high we came up with intelligence intelligence has fascinated man since the dawn of time and lead man to create one of the greatest innovations that rivaled human intelligence artificial intelligence the competition between human intelligence and artificial intelligence ultimately leads to the battle of nature and science eventually these two forms of intelligence human and artificial must coincide and it must be understood how each would interactartificial intelligence computers are everywhere today it would be impossible to go your entire life without using a computer cars atms and tvs we use everyday and all contain computers it is for this reason that computers and their software have to become more intelligent to make our lives easier and computers more accessible intelligent computer systems can and do benefit us all however people have constantly warned that making computers too intelligent can be to our disadvantageartificial intelligence artificial intelligence or ai is the study of computer science that tries to enlighten and to imitate through machinedriven or computational procedures facets of human intelligence incorporated amid these aspects of intelligence are abilities to intermingle with the natural world across sensory methods and decision making abilities in unpredictable situations

theduring the past two hundred years scientist have made numerous achievements not thought of in previous centuries there is a questions that some people have begun to ask “will science ever advance to far” some believe this is the case with artificial intelligence or ai which is the theory or goal of a series of accomplishments that would allow a computer to house a sentient life form the idea of ai has formally been around since around 1956 there has been very slow but steady progress towards aconcerns on artificial intelligence artificial intelligence is still an infant compared to other technologies it brings about great promises for our future and some even predict that its importance will rival that of the printing press boden by human nature many tried to play god people of all generation and all over the world dreamt of creating a being that is capable of carrying out human actions a few decades ago many regarded cloning as ludicrous and simplythe applications of artificial intelligence introduction artificial intelligence ai is a branch of computer science that studies the computational requirements for tasks such as perception reasoning and learning and develops systems to perform those tasks ai is a diverse field whose researchers address a wide range of problems use a variety of methods and pursue a spectrum of scientific goals for example some researchers study the requirements for expert performance at specializedartificial intelligence artificial intelligence is a broad topic consisting of different fields from machine vision to expert systems nowadays with the use of high level techniques computers have been programmed to solve many difficult problems but the products that are available today are only a sample of what is coming in the future ai has an interesting history and has always been on the pioneering end of computer science in order to classify machines as thinkingpractical artificial intelligence in the military the idea of artificial intelligence has been around for thousands of years ancient greek myths talk about how machines were made to perform tasks for their creators the most basic forms of artificial intelligence arose from people creating machinery to do tasks for them such as using windmills to mill grain or retrieve water from the ground deriving formulas of math to reach answers quicker or to print books that would have to be hand writtenartificial intelligence is defined as the development of computer systems to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence in the scientific industry artificial intelligence is used to assist surgeons in surgery referred to as robotic surgery and is most likely to become the most dominant form of surgery robot assisted surgery has been prevalent for about ten years now and is becoming popular in many industries in aeronautics nasa is implementing robotic surgery for astronauts indemonstrated by humans gets adopted in robotics and automation by the developments intensified in the field of artificial intelligence the fear of robots taking over human tasks should get dismissed because the adoption of new technology elevates innovation levels that create alternative jobs in various sectors of the economy hence employment kelly the integration of robotics and artificial intelligence in the human tasks benefits society to a great extent by simplifying tasks handling previously dirtyrepresentation of a humanoid character that is in fact a machine functioning and learning new skills with artificial intelligence the problem with these shows is that the representation of modern day artificial intelligence is largely skewed these machines have personalities and emotions making them relatable to humans when they are still just a very elaborate computer program artificial intelligence is the cognitive ability to solve problems recognize patterns and have the capability to learn withartificial intelligence way of the

intelligence this has been a big topic in technology and science news recently especially after steven hawking’s comment on the subject but before diving head first into whether or not artificial intelligence is a good or bad thing you must first know whatavailable to move itself forward computer systems known as artificial intelligence can perform the tasks humans commonly complete keswani both a child and computer construct a way to learn the information but they do this in two abstract methods which way of learning demonstrates higher efficiency while some believe computers have the ultimate gain others see them as a threat individuals question the benefits of artificial intelligence worth pushing the limits of humanity machines have beenthroughout its history artificial intelligence has always been a topic with much controversy should human intelligence be mimicked if so are there ethical bounds on what computers should be programmed to do these are a couple of question that surround the artificial intelligence controversy this paper will discuss the pros and cons of artificial intelligence so that you will be able to make an educated decision on the issue what is artificial intelligence the first step in getting anywherejennie nguyen msdecker honors english iv 24 sept 2015 the age of artificial intelligence “intelligence is described as the ability to adapt to new environments and situations and being able to understand consequences and effects that your actions cause this is something that all living creatures have in some way or another animals can adapt to their environments and react to interference and plants do the same human intelligence however is in an entirely different ball park with the uprisein the film 2001 a space odyssey it examines artificial intelligence including both its potential and uncertainties specifically it explores the complications that can emerge when humans design and build machines for example its fictional character hal is a sentient computer with intelligence that is almost identical to humans programmed to achieve highlevel tasks when hal experiences a malfunction it starts to develop a more unpredictable humanlike behavior such as showing signs ofan overview of artificial intelligence artificial intelligence a concept that would make possible our most remote dreams specially for housewives would not it be interesting to know what is this marvelous thing that is going to make our dreams come true i think it is aiartificial intelligence is a fairly new field in computer science my subject which i found very interesting ai it is not a well defined concept yet which it is not a surprise for me considering that is a verythis paper will give a brief definition of the term artificial intelligence ai it will take an indepth look at the origins and purpose of this exciting field in computer science in particular this paper will discuss a few of the many subcategories of research applications and current technological obstacles that scientist face when developing ai in addition the author will look at ai’s various military specific applications for the purpose of training target acquisition and command andthese problems the study of intelligent systems often called “artificial intelligence” ai uses computation as a medium for simulating human perception cognition reasoning learning and action in the case of artificial intelligence the first thing that usually comes to mind is that ais are convenient for mankind it makes life much easier having the artificial intelligent systems to do peoples works having artificial intelligence around not only cuts the tasks in half but also it saves lotsin the book “computer science and artificial intelligence” by the national research council staff and published by national academies press they talk about the importance of artificial intelligence in the department of defense especially in this day and age they talk about how ai could help increase national security while reducing the risk for humans in hostile environments ch2 pg 14 along with that it states that if we could advance far enough the goal is to entirely replace the needartificial intelligence at a time when computer technology is advancing at a rapid pace and when software developers are convincingly hawking their products as having artificial intelligence the inevitable question has begun to take on a certain urgency can a computer think really think in one form or another this is actually a very old question dating back to such philosopherstangible and can be recreated according to turing turing a physicalist believed that artificial intelligence could be achieved in the future turing argued that the mind was merely due to the physical aspects of the brain and so a machine could one day be created that has a mind of its own ie artificial intelligence he created a test called the turing test to determine whether a machine has artificial intelligence in the turing test an interrogator asks two subjects a series of questions one“whoever perceives that robots and artificial intelligence are merely here to serve humanity think again with virtual domestic assistants and driverless cars just the latest in a growing list of applications it is we humans who risk becoming dumbed down and ultimately subservient to machines” ― alex morritt as the years have progressed more and more people have adapted artificial intelligence systems into their home and everyday lives a range of inventions include patient simulation systemsnot long ago spoke at the artificial intelligence and the singularity conference in oakland california there was a huge turnout of speakers including ai specialists peter voss and monica anderson new york university educator gary marcus science fiction author nicole sallak anderson and futurist scott jackisch we were all fascinated in how the introduction of artificial intelligence will impact the world my subject was the morality of an artificial intelligence will be different from ourlong lasting history deep sociocultural roots and certain health risks historical roots signs and symbols are a unique phenomenon in the world history professor david d nolte in a book on human intelligence and artificial intelligence states “the feature that most distinguishes human intelligence from that of other animals is our sophisticated manipulation of signs to represent our world” 43 these words echo with the english philosopher lady welbygregory’s opinion carefully defined by italianartificial intelligence introduction today people are interacting more and more with computers life is running at a microchip speed if all computers are stopped for a day complete civilization comes to a halt fifty years ago this mightve been a science fiction but today it is a reality further with computers being embedded in all of our life accessories like mobiles watches cars even our bodies and brains there is no indication that this microchipartificial intelligence artificial intelligence is the technology that involves computers and machines displaying it’s own intelligence the practical uses for computers making their own decisions is a very important technology to develop because this would allow the deployment of robots in environments too harsh for humans to brave such as other planets or even war zones while artificial intelligence is a very good idea true human intelligence will be very difficult to reach while a computerartificial intelligence research paper genesis creation the very beginning from his inception man has endeavored to control to name to create ultimately in his own image as he was created from god man forges his own destiny from the coals of his imagination and the raw iron of his will to create his tools have changed as time has passed but his desire his fire to create to change his world has not time and technology can temper mans creativity but the desire burns as strongartificial intelligence and investing introduction artificial intelligence can be defined as the ability of a computer to perform activities normally considered to require human intelligence the techniques of this intelligence include knowledgebased machine learning and natural language processing techniques investing can be defined as the act of committing money to an endeavour with the exception of obtaining profit investing activities require data identification asset valuation themany unresolved questions in roboethics and offer some solutions it is essential that computer scientists resolve as many ethical conflicts as possible before the inevitable arrival of true ai it is important to understand how and when artificial intelligence will form when discussing its impact on society while the expected arrival time of ai has proven to be historically unreliable professionals in the field still claim it will happen within our lifetimes but how will ai and superintelligenceartificial intelligence or al for short capability of a computer to perform functions that is normally associated with human intelligence such as reasoning learning or selfimprovement its concept requests a lot more than present information to the user it requires that the machine is not only able to store and manipulate information but also to deal with its meaning ai is what we call understanding a combination of computer science physiology and philosophy the element that the fieldsthe topic of artificial intelligence ai is very important in today s society there are opinions on both sides of this issue the issue is important because the research going into ai is showing a lot of progress this paper will explore both sides of three issues related to ai how close are we to creating artificial intelligence the first issue related to this topic is whether we are close to creating artificial intelligence or if we have a while yet before we see any form of it everyonethis intelligence being created can do monotonous jobs significantly faster than the average worker go places that are hard to reach and think better and faster compared to humans businesses are thrilled at the prospect of cutting down on their biggest cost labor and getting jobs done quickly and more efficiently but for the common middleclass bluecollar worker it could mean a loss of wages and a forced cross training into another field in the wake of this extraordinary artificial intelligenceartificial intelligence is intelligence exhibited by machines or software artificial intelligence also studies how people create computers that are capable or preforming an intelligent behavior like a human business dictionary to back up artificial intelligence there is functionalism hilary putman developed functionalism in the 1970’s which is still the dominant theory in todays’

technologies that may or may not live up to their hype the key difference we now have sufficient processing power to make good on ai’s promiseai’s strength is processing input from many signals

interest in ai has recently exploded the field has traditionally been a specialist domain this article aims to make the field of ai approachable to a broader audienceventure capitalists look for valuecreating technologies that can define the next era of innovation the potential of ai to impact the world has been compared to that of the internet or mobile computing this article summarizes the key concepts and issues surrounding ai and explains its importance to humanitytechnological progress is the primary driver of gdp per capita growth increasing output faster than labor or capital1 however the economic benefits of technological progress are not necessarily evenly distributed across society for example technological change in the 19th century increased the productivity of lowskilled workers relative to that of highskilled workers highly skilled artisans who controlled and executed full production processes saw their occupations threatened by the rise of mass production technologies eventually many highly skilled artisans were replaced by a combination of machines and lowskilled laborthroughout the late 20th century technological change worked in a different direction the introduction of personal computing and the internet increased the relative productivity of highskilled workers lowskilled occupations that were routineintensive and focused on predictable easilyprogrammable tasks—such as filing clerks travel agents and assembly line workers—were increasingly replaced by new technologiestoday precisely predicting which jobs will be most affected by ai is challenging we do know that ai will produce smarter machines that can perform more sophisticated functions and erode some of the advantages that humans currently possess in fact ai systems now regularly outperform humans at certain specialized tasks in a new study economists and computer scientists trained an algorithm to predict whether defendants were a flight risk using data from hundreds of thousands of cases in new york city when tested on over a hundred thousand more cases that it had not seen before the algorithm proved better than judges at predicting what defendants would do after being released2 ai may eliminate some jobs but it could also increase worker productivity and the demand for specific skills all occupations from low to highskilled will be affected by the technological change brought about by aialthough ai research started in the 1950s its effectiveness and progress have been most significant over the last decade driven by three mutually reinforcing factorssignificant progress in algorithms hardware and big data technology combined with the financial incentives to find new products have also contributed to the ai technology renaissanceartificial intelligenceartificial intelligence ai is an umbrella term for intelligence exhibited by machines or computer programs3 simple ai programs that use rulebased logic to mimic primitive intelligence have existed since the 1950s however such programs were incapable of handling realworld complexity reallife conditions vary and are often unpredictable and programmers could not possibly write code to handle every scenariomachine learningmachine learning ml a subfield of ai overcomes this limitation by shifting some of the burden from the programmer to the algorithm instead of basing the machine’s decisionmaking process on rules that are defined explicitly by a human a machine learning algorithm identifies patterns and relationships in data that allow it to make predictions about data it has not seen before data is to machine learning what life is to human learning thus for ml to work reliably the technology requires continual access to massive volumes and a broad variety of data—referred to as big data4ml practitioners develop their algorithms by using their data to train models a model can be thought of as a black box that is we as the observer can use it without knowing about its internal workings that ingests data and produces an output that represents a predictionmodels cannot make good predictions without data on which to base them for this reason a practitioner begins with a historical data set and divides it into a training set and a test set the training set is used to train the model and contains the inputs for the model and the real values of the metric that the model is designed to predict this allows the model to essentially check its answers and learn from its mistakes to improve its future predictions after the training is completed the test set is used to assess the effectiveness of the trained model the primary aim of ml is to create a model that can generalize and make good predictions on data it has not seen before not just for data on which it has been traineddeep learningsome of the most impressive recent advancements in ml have been in the subfield of deep learning dl dl is helpful to practitioners because it allows algorithms to automatically discover complex patterns and relationships in the input data that may be useful for forming predictions dl automates the feature engineering—the process of learning the optimal features to create the best performing model with “usual” ml techniques the burden of feature engineering is often a tedious task that relies on human domain experts dl overcomes this challenge by automatically detecting the most suitable features in essence deep learning algorithms learn how to learn given its breakthrough importance it is valuable to understand the basics of deep learning first deep learning uses a structure called an artificial neural networkan artificial neural network ann is a computational model based loosely on the biological neural network of the human brainalthough the mathematics of neural networking is highly sophisticated the basic concepts of neural networks can be demonstrated without calculationsneural networks basicsneural networks are typically organized in layers composed of interconnected nodes that contain an activation function data is presented to the network via the input layer which connects to one or more hidden layers where the actual processing is done by altering the weights of each connection the hidden layers also connect to an output layer as shown belowmost anns contain a learning rule that modifies the connection weights based on the input patterns that it was presented more simply artificial neural networks learn by example similar to biological neural networks human brains learn to do complex things such as recognizing objects not by processing exhaustive rules but through experience practice and feedback for instance a child experiences the world sees a dog makes predictions “dog” and receives feedback “yes” without being given a set of rules the child learns through traininga neural network learns through training using an algorithm called backpropagation which is an abbreviation for the backward propagation of errors in backpropagation learning occurs with each example through the forward propagation of output and the backwards propagation of weight adjustments when a neural network receives an initial input pattern it makes a random guess as to what that pattern might be it then calculates the “error”—how far its answer was from the correct answer—and appropriately adjusts its connection weights to reduce this errorbackpropagation is used in conjunction with gradient descent an optimization algorithm to find the global minimum of the error surface within the solution’s vector space the global minimum is the theoretical solution with the lowest possible error the error surface itself is a paraboloid as shown belowthe speed of learning is the rate of convergence of the current solution and the global minimum the theoretical lowest possible erroronce a neural network is trained it may be used to analyze new data that is the practitioner stops the training and allows the network to function in forward propagation mode only the forward propagation output is the predicted model used to interpret and make sense of previously unknown input dataneural networks are one of many algorithms used in machine learning additional machine learning algorithms are listed in the table belowai will continue to be a valuable tool for improving the

2009the subfield of computer science concerned with understanding the nature of intelligence and constructing computer systems capable of intelligent action it embodies the dual motives of furthering basic scientific understanding and making computers more sophisticated in the service of humanitymany activities involve intelligent action—problem solving perception learning planning and other symbolic reasoning creativity language and so forth—and therein lie an immense diversity of phenomena scientific concern for these phenomena is shared by many fields for example psychology linguistics and philosophy of mind in addition to artificial intelligence the starting point for artificial intelligence is the capability of the computer to manipulate symbolic expressions that can represent all manner of things including knowledge about the structure and function of objects and people in the world beliefs and purposes scientific theories and the programs of action of the computer itselfartificial intelligence is primarily concerned with symbolic representations of knowledge and heuristic methods of reasoning that is using common assumptions and rules of thumb two examples of problems studied in artificial intelligence are planning how a robot or person might assemble a complicated device or move from one place to another and diagnosing the nature of a persons disease or of a machines malfunction from the observable manifestations of the problem in both cases reasoning with symbolic descriptions predominates over calculatingthe approach of artificial intelligence researchers is largely experimental with small patches of mathematical theory as in other experimental sciences investigators build devices in this case computer programs to carry out their experimental investigations new programs are created to explore ideas about how intelligent action might be attained and are also developed to test hypotheses about concepts or mechanisms involved in intelligent behaviorthe foundations of artificial intelligence are divided into representation problemsolving methods architecture and knowledge to work on a task a computer must have an internal representation in its memory for example the symbolic description of a room for a moving robot or a set of features describing a person with a disease the representation also includes all the knowledge including basic programs for testing and measuring the structure plus all the programs for transforming the structure into another one in ways appropriate to the task changing the representation used for a task can make an immense difference turning a problem from impossible to trivialgiven the representation of a task a method must be adopted that has some chance of accomplishing the task artificial intelligence has gradually built up a stock of relevant problemsolving methods the socalled weak methods that apply extremely generallyan important feature of all the weak methods is that they involve search one of the most important generalizations to arise in artificial intelligence is the ubiquity of search it appears to underlie all intelligent action in the worst case the search is blind in heuristic search extra information is used to guide the searchsome of the weak methods are generateandtest a sequence of candidates is generated each being tested for solutionhood hill climbing a measure of progress is used to guide each step meansends analysis the difference between the desired situation and the present one is used to select the next step impasse resolution the inability to take the desired next step leads to a subgoal of making the step feasible planning by abstraction the task is simplified solved and the solution used as a guide and matching the present situation is represented as a schema to be mapped into the desired situation by putting the two in correspondencean intelligent agent—person or program—has multiple means for representing tasks and dealing with them also required is an architecture or operating framework within which to select and carry out these activities often called the executive or control structure it is best viewed as a total architecture as in computer architecture that is a machine that provides data structures operations on those data structures memory for holding data structures accessing operations for retrieving data structures from memory a programming language for expressing integrated patterns of conditional operations and an interpreter for carrying out programs any digital computer provides an architecture as does any programming language architectures are not all equivalent and one important scientific question is what architecture is appropriate for a general intelligent agentin artificial intelligence the basic paradigm of intelligent action is that of search through a space of partial solutions called the problem space for a goal situation each step offers several possibilities leading to a cascading of possibilities that can be represented as a branching tree the search is thus said to be combinatorial or exponential for example if there are 10 possible actions in any situation and it takes a sequence of 12 steps to find a solution a goal state then there are 1012 possible sequences in the exhaustive search tree what keeps the search under control is knowledge which suggests how to choose or narrow the options at each step thus the fourth fundamental concern is how to represent knowledge in the memory of the system so it can be brought to bear on the search when relevantan intelligent agent will have immense amounts of knowledge this implies another major problem that of discovering the relevant knowledge as the solution attempt progresses although this search does not include the combinatorial explosion characteristic of searching the problem space it can be time consuming and hard however the structure of the database holding the knowledge called the knowledge base can be carefully tailored to suit the architecture in order to make the search efficient this knowledge base with its accompanying problems of encoding and access constitutes the final ingredient of an intelligent systeman example of artificial intelligence is computer perception perception is the formation from a sensory signal of an internal representation suitable for intelligent processing though there are many types of sensory signals computer perception has focused on vision and speech perception might seem to be distinct from intelligence since it involves incident timevarying continuous energy distributions prior to interpretation in symbolic terms however all the same ingredients occur representation search architecture and knowledge speech perception starts with the acoustic wave of a human utterance and proceeds to an internal representation of what the speech is about a sequence of representations is used the digitization of the acoustic wave into an array of intensities the formation of a small set of parametric quantities that vary continuously with time such as the intensities and frequencies of the formants bands of resonant energy characteristic of speech a sequence of phons members of a finite alphabet of labels for characteristic sounds analogous to letters a sequence of words a parsed sequence of words reflecting grammatical structure and finally a semantic data structure representing a sentence or other utterance that reflects the meaning behind the soundsa class of artificial intelligence programs called expert systems attempt to accomplish tasks by acquiring and incorporating the same knowledge that human experts have many attempts to apply artificial intelligence to medicine government and other socially significant tasks take the form of expert systems even though the emphasis is on knowledge all the standard ingredients are presentin careful tests a number of expert systems have shown performance at levels of quality equivalent to or better than average practicing professionals for example average practicing physicians on the restricted domains over which they operate nearly all large corporations and many smaller ones use expert systems a common application is to provide technical assistance to persons who answer customers trouble calls computer companies use expert systems to assist in configuring components from a parts catalog into a complete system that matches a customers specifications a kind of application that has been replicated in other industries tailoring assembled products to customers needs troubleshooting and diagnostic programs are commonplace another widespread use of this technology is in software for home computers that assists taxpayers one important lesson learned from incorporating artificial intelligence software into ongoing practice is that its success depends on many other aspects besides the intrinsic intellectual quality for example ease of interaction integration into existing workflow and costsexpert systems have sparked important insights in reasoning under uncertainty causal reasoning reasoning about knowledge and acceptance of computer systems in the workplace they illustrate that there is no hard separation between pure and applied artificial intelligence finding what is required for intelligent action in a complex applied area makes a significant contribution to basic knowledge see expert systemsin addition to the subject areas mentioned above significant work in artificial intelligence has been done on puzzles and reasoning tasks induction and concept identification symbolic mathematics theorem proving in formal logic natural language understanding and generation vision robotics chemistry biology engineering analysis computerhyphenassisted instruction and computerprogram synthesis and verification to name only the most prominent as computers become smaller and less

updated 12312018issue artificial intelligence ai is the study and development by which a computer and its systems are given the ability to successfully accomplish a task typically requiring a humans intelligent behavior currently within traditional industries many tasks are achieved by humansfor example gathering information analyzing data by running a model or using personal judgement and finally making a decision ai allows technology to replace humans on all of these stepsfrom data collection and analysis down to the final decisionmakingthe use of ai has increased exponentially across industries over the past several years the rise in accessible data increased computing capabilities and changing consumer expectations has led to a strong acceleration of ai development we are now using ai throughout the landscape of our livesoften without realizing it consequently ai is rapidly evolving and creating viable opportunities for business growth it is disrupting and improving organizations across all industries including insurance companies such as ibm apple google facebook and amazon are leveraging ai platforms and solutions for customers partners and employees while insurers are in the early stages of catching this wave they are said to be ripe for transformation in areas such as underwriting customer service claims marketing and fraud detectionbackground over the past several years ai technology has progressed immensely and continues to develop and improve all the time it has become increasingly proficient at performing tasks historically difficult for computers to execute including recognizing images identifying spoken words and using unstructured data the acceleration in ai is being driven by exceptional technological advances along with a major shift in customer expectations higher computer power memory capacity cloud computing big data technologies and global connectivity of both people and machines have enabled machines to run complex algorithms faster than humans and handle more input data than a human could moreover shaped by their experiences with other industries insurance customers particularly millennials now expect quick ondemand servicesthe successes of ai are also being facilitated by the massive amounts of data we have today the wealth of data we now create is astonishing and the speed at which data is generated has only made data management tools like ai all the more important whether it is structured or unstructured data eg social media wearables telematics sensors news weather and traffic reports ai is helping organizations make sense of big data driverless cars create roughly 4 terabytes of data a day stemming from onvehicle sensors and digital maps statistical models cannot handle that amount of data as ai is able to execute complex analyses and computations at a speed impossible for humans it generates faster insightsai has the potential to affect the insurance industry in multiple ways the most obvious areas it can be used include claims processing underwriting fraud detection and customer service for example to improve customer experience many insurers are investing in virtual assistants like chatbots a chatbot is a digital service capable of holding natural sounding conversations with human beings with the aim of accomplishing particular tasks such as answering questions in addition to answering questions chatbots are available 247 to give basic advice check billing information and address common inquiries and transactions insurers currently using chatbots include startup lemonade geico allstate and lincoln financial in addition claims management can be augmented using machine learning techniques in different stages of the claim handling process for example machine learning models can help quickly assess the severity of damages and predict the repair costs from historical data sensors and images lemonade for example asserts that as early as 2016 its chatbot jim settled a claim within 3 seconds a 2018 accenture survey found four out of five insurance executives believe that ai will work next to humans in their organizations as a coworker collaborator and trusted advisor within the next two yearsmoreover insurers are sitting on a treasuretrove of big data the main ingredient ai requires to be successful the abundance of data fused with unstructured data can be leveraged to increase customer engagement create more personalized service and more meaningful marketing messages sell the right product to customers and actually target the right customerstatus the emergence of ai is a powerful form of technology with the potential to transform the insurance industry in a number of ways so far the impact of ai in insurance has been minimal the insurance industry has only begun its venture into ai with many traditional insurers experimenting with new ways to incorporate it into their daytoday operations in anticipation of further technological development insurtech startups are also harnessing ai to develop solutions to streamline operations create better underwriting models and enhance customer service however while ai provides opportunities for traditional insurers to modernize themselves implementing ai is not straightforward traditional insurers could face challenges integrating ai into their existing technology due to issues such as data quality privacy and infrastructure compatibility according to the accenture reportthe naic recently formed the innovation and technology ex task force to explore the technological developments in the insurance sector the task force will provide a forum for the discussion of innovation and technology developments in order to educate state insurance regulators on how these developments will affect consumer protection insurer and producer oversight and the state insurance regulatory framework the task force is also charged to discuss emerging issues related to insurers or licensees leveraging new technologies such as artificial intelligence'})

mainstream to begin to impact many aspects of our lives in a truly ubiquitous and meaningful way says ralph haupter the president of microsoft asiathe idea that computers have some amount of intelligence is not new says haupter pointing as far back as 1950 when computer pioneer alan turing asked whether machines can think so it has taken nearly 70 years for the right combination of factors to come together to move ai from concept to an increasingly ubiquitous reality says haupterthose factors are the mass distribution and use of internetconnected devices which generate massive quantities of data and cloud computing and software algorithms that can recognize patterns within data he saysthe development of artificial intelligence will be the story of the coming generations not just the coming year but as 2018 gets underway here are eight ways ai will begin to touch your lifepersonal assistant ais will keep getting smarter as our personal assistants learn more about our daily routines i can imagine the day i need not to worry about preparing dinner my ai knows what i like what i have in my pantry which days of the week i like to cook at home and makes sure that when i get back from work all my groceries are waiting at my doorstep ready for me to prepare that delicious meal i had been craving — alejandro troccoli senior research scientist nvidiabecause of the popularity of voicebased personal assistants were starting to see the technology embedded across a wide range of devices from lamps to tvs to cars and beyond in addition after initial experiments with a single unit many people have started putting smart speakers all over their homes the practical net result is that sometime in 2018 a large percentage of personal assistant users will have regular access to multiple assistants simultaneously—often across multiple platforms combine that with the fact that in 2018 well likely start seeing vendors enabling people to customize the trigger word for these various assistants to start listening and well its a quick recipe for disaster …dont get me wrong im certainly excited about the potential that voicebased interactions can bring to speakers and all our tech devices but im concerned we could hit some serious roadblocks in 2018 — bob odonnell president founder and chief analyst at technalysis research a market research and consulting firmthanks to ai the face will be the new credit card the new drivers license and the new barcode facial recognition is already completely transforming security with biometric capabilities being adopted and seeing how tech and retail are merging like amazon is with whole foods i can see a near future where people will no longer need to stand in line at the store — georges nahon ceo orange silicon valley president orange institute a global research colaboratoryas ai permeates the enterprise everyone—from the ceo and business unit leaders to your middle managers and frontline employees—will need to be conversant in some basic terminology speaking the same language gets organizations on the same page and helps demystify ais role in the enterprise and what it means for business processes and workers —chris curran chief technologist for pricewaterhousecoopers us and anand rao innovation lead for pricewaterhousecoopers us analytics groupgiven the rapid pace of research i expect ai to be able to create new personalized media such as music according to your taste imagine a future music service that doesnt just play existing songs you might like but continually generates new songs just for you — jan kautz senior director of visual computing and machine learning research nvidiaimagine market reports that were written on demand and not just when the market closed these reports could be more than just a simple recap of market performance but a comparison of a how a readers portfolio performed against the broader market as well as key reasons why for example its 335 pm the market is currently up 1 but your portfolio is down 2 this is attributed in part to the purchase of xx stock last week which has fallen sharply since …how close are we to being able to do this and much more the technologies are very nearly here already and newsrooms are starting to embrace the possibilities — reg chua chief operating officer reuters newsi believe practical advancements in artificial intelligence will start to enable a more contextual form of computing with some of our devices particularly smartphones and smart speakers going beyond the simple question and single discrete response that typically marks these interactions now we should start to see more humanlike responses to our queries and requests multipart conversations more comprehensive answers as well as appropriate and even insightful suggestions based on what it is were doing or trying to do will start to give us the sense that our devices are getting smart ironically part of the way this development will likely occur is by learning more about people and how they think—essentially building a form of digital empathy — bob odonnell president founder and chief analyst at technalysis research a market research and consulting firm2018 will be the year ai becomes real for medicine by the end of the year i think around half of leading healthcare systems will have adopted some form of ai within their diagnostic groups and while a lot of this adoption will happen first in the diagnostic medical specialties were seeing solutions for population health hospital operations and a broad set of clinical specialties quickly follow behind in 2018 well begin the adoption of a technology that may truly transform the way providers work and the way patients experience healthcare on a global scale — mark michalski executive director massachusetts general hospital and brigham and womens center for clinical data sciencesee alsoin the same way there was a nuclear arms race there

newsletter', 'p': 'this article is part of demystifying ai a series of posts that try to disambiguate the jargon and myths surrounding aiif you’re living on this planet you probably hear a lot about artificial intelligence these days it’s conquering every industry and domain performing tasks more efficiently than humans will put humans out of work and may one day force humans into slavery you might have also heard about narrow general and super artificial intelligence or about machine learning deep learning reinforced learning supervised and unsupervised learning neural networks bayesian networks and a whole lot of other confusing termsthat’s a lot of jargon to cover in one post and we’ll leave the learning stuff for another day in this post we’ll try to define what ai is and isn’t maybe and what are the three main known flavors of aiit’s hard to define google the term and you’ll get a lot of different and sometimes conflicting results wikipedia gives it the shortest and most ambiguous definition of “intelligence exhibited by machines” but then it gives a more understandable definition of machines that mimics cognitive functions such as problem solving and learningthe truth is that ai is hard to define because intelligence is hard to define in the first place but what we all agree on is that artificial intelligence is not natural such as what you find in human beings and some species of animals it’s manmade yet it can reason make decisions that take into account various factors such as how the human brain functions in generalrelated what is the difference between artificial intelligence machine learning and deep learninglet’s also make it clear that the term “robot” is not a synonym for ai even though it is sometimes used in that way including by myself artificial intelligence is a reference to the software that manifests intelligence whereas robots infer a physical element a shell which carries out the decisions made by the ai engine behind it not every ai needs a robot to carry out its functions and retrospectively not every robot needs true ai to power its functionalityas we move forward and technology progresses and evolves our definition of ai changes in fact john mccarthy who coined the term “artificial intelligence” in 1956 stressed that “as soon as it works no one calls it ai anymore” today many of the rules and logicbased systems that were previously considered artificial intelligence are no longer classified as ai in contrast systems that analyze and find patterns in data machine learning are becoming the dominant form of aibut regardless of the mechanisms and behind the scenes the level of ai can be broken down into three main categoriesnarrow ai is the only form of artificial intelligence that humanity has achieved so far this is ai that is good at performing a single task such as playing chess or go making purchase suggestions sales predictions and weather forecasts computer vision natural language processing are still at the current stage narrow ai speech and image recognition are narrow ai even if their advances seem fascinating even google’s translation engine sophisticated as it is is a form of narrow artificial intelligenceselfdriving car technology is still considered a type of narrow ai or more precisely a coordination of several narrow aisrelated albeit smart ai algorithms have distinct challenges to overcomein essence narrow ai works within a very limited context and can’t take on tasks beyond its field so you can’t expect the same engine that transcripts audio and video files to say order pizza for you that’s the task of another ainarrow ai is sometimes also referred to as “weak ai” however that doesn’t mean that narrow ai is inefficient in contrary it is very good at routine jobs both physical and cognitive it’s narrow ai that is threatening to replace or rather displace many human jobs and it’s narrow ai that can ferret out patterns and correlations from data that would take eons for humans to findbut it’s still not humanlevel ai that’s the stuff of artificial general intelligencegeneral ai also known as humanlevel ai or strong ai is the type of artificial intelligence that can understand and reason its environment as a human would general ai has always been elusive we’ve been saying for decades that it’s just around the cornerrelated the biggest ai developments of 2016but the more we delve into it the more we realize that it’s hard to achieve—and the more we come to appreciate the miracle that is behind the human brain it’s really hard to define what a humanlevel artificial intelligence would be you just need to look at how you perceive things juggle between multiple unrelated thoughts and memories when making a decision that’s very hard for computers to achievehumans might not be able to process data as fast as computers but they can think abstractly and plan solve problems at a general level without going into the details they can innovate come up with thoughts and ideas that have no precedence think about the invention of the telephone ships telescopes concepts such as mail social media gaming virtual reality it’s very hard to teach a computer to invent something that isn’t theresome say we’ll see general ai before the turn of the century some such as google’s peter norvig and ibm’s rob high believe we don’t even need human level aiaccording to university of oxford scholar and ai expert nick bostrom when ai becomes much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field including scientific creativity general wisdom and social skills we’ve achieved artificial super intelligenceasi is even more vague than agi at this pointby some accounts the distance between agi and asi is very short it’ll happen in mere months weeks or maybe the blink of an eye and will continue at the speed of light what happens then no one knows for sure some scientists such as stephen hawking see the development of full artificial intelligence as the potential end of humanity others such as google’s demis hassabis believe the smarter ai gets the better humans will become at saving the environment curing diseases explore the universe and at understanding themselvesrelated will general ai lead us to apocalypse or utopiaas for me for the moment i’m pestered by these smart online ads that seem to be shadowing my every move on the internet and these youtube suggestions that are all worth watching narrow ai is getting on my nerves i guess general ai will drive me crazy if i live to see itmaybe we need a new way for ai to discern self recognition as it seems to be the frontal bias used by most zoos and top researchers in the prediction game of self recognitionawareness there is nothing more self aware by any logic if you can get even ai to recognize the constrictions of reality and to have ai recognize it is in fact fallible and mortal like any of us i can’t imagine a better predictor than those simple basics problem is just because you can get a chimp to recognize an image of itself in a mirror doesn’t mean an ai given the same experiment actually perceives it in similar sense this is the logic problem in my viewi honestly don’t think we will ever see human level intelligence in ai we are well just not intelligent enough our selves to get there yet japanese fembots will mostly likely be the only future past the 2050’s for some time though… narrow artificial intelligence is now prevalent which means programs are better than humans at performing specific tasks perhaps the most famous example is ibm’s deep blue defeating garry kasparov the world champion of chess at the time — in 1997 today complex algorithms outperform humans at driving and analyzing lab results among many other things …i somehow doubt we will see agi in our lifetimes… in order to develop it we might just need to increase our own intellect first through what elon musk calls human intelligence and neurallink before then we won’t be smart enough to develop it andor it will just take centuries…this site uses akismet to reduce spam learn how your comment data is processed', 'ul': 'home blog

markkula center for applied ethics views are his ownartificial intelligence and machine learning technologies are rapidly transforming society and will almost certainly continue to do so in the coming decades this social transformation will have deep ethical impact with these powerful new technologies both improving and disrupting human lives ai as the externalization of human intelligence offers us in amplified form everything that humanity already is both good and evil much is at stake at this crossroads in history we should think very carefully about how to make this transition or we risk empowering the grimmer side of our nature rather than the brighterthe markkula center for applied ethics recently joined the partnership on ai to benefit people and society and as an institution we have been thinking deeply about the ethics of ai for several years in that spirit we offer a preliminary list of issues with ethical relevance in ai and machine learningthe first question for any technology is whether it works as intended will ai systems work as they are promised or will they fail if and when they fail what will be the results of those failures and if we are dependent upon them will we be able to survive without themfor example at least one person has already died in a semiautonomous car accident because the vehicle encountered a situation in which the manufacturer anticipated it would fail and expected the human driver to take over but the human driver didn’t correct the situationthe question of technical safety and failure is separate from the question of how a properlyfunctioning technology might be used for good or for evil questions 3 and 4 below this question is merely one of function yet it is the foundation upon which all the rest of the analysis must buildonce we have determined that the technology functions adequately can we actually understand how it works and properly gather data on its functioning ethical analysis always depends on getting the facts first – only then can evaluation beginit turns out that with some machine learning techniques such as deep learning in neural networks it can be difficult or impossible to really understand why the machine is making the choices that it makes in other cases it might be that the machine can explain something but the explanation is too complex for humans to understandfor example in 2014 a computer proved a mathematical theorem called the “erdos discrepancy problem” using a proof that was at the time at least longer than the entire wikipedia encyclopedia explanations of this sort might be true explanations but humans will never know for sureas an additional point in general the more powerful someone or something is the more transparent it ought to be while the weaker someone is the more right to privacy he or she should have therefore the idea that powerful ais might be intrinsically opaque is disconcertinga perfectly well functioning technology such as a nuclear weapon can when put to its intended use cause immense evil artificial intelligence like human intelligence will be used maliciously there is no doubtfor example aipowered surveillance is already widespread in both appropriate contexts eg airportsecurity cameras and perhaps inappropriate ones eg products with alwayson microphones in our homes more obviously nefarious examples might include aiassisted computerhacking or lethal autonomous weapons systems laws aka “killer robots” additional fears of varying degrees of plausibility include scenarios like those in the movies “2001 a space odyssey” “wargames” and “terminator”while movies and weapons technologies might seem to be extreme examples of how ai might empower evil we should remember that competition and war are always primary drivers of technological advance and that militaries and corporations are working on these technologies right now history also shows that great evils are not always completely intended eg stumbling into world war i and various nuclear closecalls in the cold war and so having destructive power even if not intending to use it still risks catastrophe because of this forbidding banning and relinquishing certain types of technology would be the most prudent solutionthe main purpose of ai is like every other technology to help people lead longer more flourishing more fulfilling lives this is good and therefore insofar as ai helps people in these ways we can be glad and appreciate the benefits it gives to usadditional intelligence will likely provide improvements in nearly every field of human endeavor including for example archaeology biomedical research communication data analytics education energy efficiency environmental protection farming finance legal services medical diagnostics resource management space exploration transportation waste management and so onas just one concrete example of a benefit from ai some farm equipment now has computer systems capable of visually identifying weeds and spraying them with tiny targeted doses of herbicide this not only protects the environment by reducing the use of chemicals on crops but it also protects human health by reducing exposure to these chemicalsone of the interesting things about neural networks the current workhorses of artificial intelligence is that they effectively merge a computer program with the data that is given to it this has many benefits but it also risks biasing the entire system in unexpected and potentially detrimental waysalready algorithmic bias has been discovered for example in areas ranging from criminal sentencing to photograph captioning these biases are more than just embarrassing to the corporations which produce these defective products they have concrete negative and harmful effects on the people who are victims of these biases as well as reducing trust in corporations government and other institutions which might be using these biased products algorithmic bias is one of the major concerns in ai right now and will remain so in the future unless we endeavor to make our technological products better than we are as one person said at a recent meeting of the partnership on ai “we will reproduce all of our human faults in artificial form unless we strive right now to make sure that we don’t”many people have already perceived that ai will be a threat to certain categories of jobs indeed automation of industry has been a major contributing factor in job losses since the beginning of the industrial revolution ai will simply extend this trend to more fields including fields that have been traditionally thought of as being safer from automation for example law medicine and education other than the job of ai developer it is not clear what new careers these unemployed people will be able to transition into and even ai programming may become at least partially automated in the futureattached to the concern for employment is the concern for how humanity spends its time and what makes a life wellspent what will millions of unemployed people do what good purposes can they have what can they contribute to the wellbeing of society how will society prevent them from becoming disillusioned bitter and swept up in evil movements such as white supremacy and terrorismrelated to the unemployment problem is the question of how people will survive if unemployment rises to very high levels where will they get money to maintain themselves and their families while prices may decrease due to lowered cost of production those who control ai will also likely rake in much of the money that would have otherwise gone into the wages of the nowunemployed and therefore economic inequality will increasesome people including some billionaires like mark zuckerberg have suggested a universal basic income ubi to address the problem but this will require a major reconstruction of national economies various other solutions to this problem may be possible but they all involve potentially major changes to human society and government ultimately this is a political problem not a technical one so this solution like those to many of the problems described here needs to be addressed at the political levelif we turn over our decisionmaking capacities to machines we will become less experienced at making decisions for example this is a wellknown phenomenon among airline pilots the autopilot can do everything about flying an airplane from takeoff to landing but pilots intentionally choose to manually control the aircraft at crucial times in order to maintain their piloting skillsbecause one of the uses of ai will be to either assist or replace humans at making certain types of decisions eg spelling driving stocktrading etc we should be aware that humans may become worse at these skills in its most extreme form if ai starts to make ethical and political decisions for us we will become worse at ethics and politics we may reduce or stunt our moral development precisely at the time when our power has become greatest and our decisions the most importantthis means that the study of ethics and ethics training are now more important than ever we should determine ways in which ai can actually enhance our ethical learning and training we should never allow ourselves to become deskilled and debilitated at ethics or when our technology finally does present us with a problem we must solve we may be like frightened and confused children before a creation we do not understandsome thinkers have wondered whether ais might eventually become selfconscious attain their own volition or otherwise deserve recognition as persons like ourselves legally speaking personhood has been given to corporations and in other countries rivers so there is certainly no need for consciousness even before legal questions may arisemorally speaking we can anticipate that technologists will attempt to make the most humanlike ais and robots possible and perhaps someday they will be such good imitations that we will wonder if they might be conscious and deserve rights – and we might not be able to determine this conclusively if future humans do conclude ais and robots might be worthy of moral status then we ought to err on the side of caution and fairness and give itin the midst of this uncertainty about the status of our creations what we will know though is that we humans have moral characters and that to quote aristotle “we become what we repeatedly do” so we ought not to treat ais and robots badly or we might be habituating ourselves towards having flawed characters regardless of the moral status of the artificial beings we are interacting with in other words no matter the status of ais and robots for the sake of our own moral characters we ought to treat them well or at least not abuse themall of the above areas of interest will have effects on how humans perceive themselves relate to each other and live their lives but there is a more existential question too if the purpose and identity of humanity has something to do with our intelligence as several prominent greek philosophers believed for example then by externalizing our intelligence and improving beyond human intelligence are we making ourselves secondclass beings to our own creationsthis is a deeper question with artificial intelligence which cuts to the core of our humanity into areas traditionally reserved for philosophy spirituality and religion what will happen to the human spirit if or when we are bested by our own creations in everything that we do will human life lose meaning will we come to a new discovery of our identity beyond our intelligence perhaps intelligence is not as important to our identity as we might think it is and perhaps turning over intelligence to machines will help us to realize thatthis is just a start at the exploration of the ethics of ai there is much more to say new technologies are always created for the sake of something good – and ai offers us amazing new powers through the concerted effort of many individuals and organizations we can hope to use ai to make a better worldthis article is an adaptation of a paper presented to the pacific coast theological society november 3rd 2017 a shorter draft was presented on october 24th 2017 at santa clara university at a panel entitled “ai ethical

artificial intelligence 2 contents overview applications languages ai introduction 3 introductionclaiming to be able to recreate the capabilities ofthe human mind is both a challenge and aninspiration for philosophy• it is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines especially intelligent computer programs 4 are there limits to how intelligentmachines can be\uf097 intelligence“the capacity to learn and solve problems”\uf097 artificial intelligence ◦ artificial intelligence ai is the intelligence of machines and robots and the branch of computer science that aims to create it \uf096 the ability to solve problems \uf096 the ability to act rationally \uf096 the ability to act like humans 5 philosophy of ai\uf097 searles strong ai hypothesis the appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds\uf097 the artificial brain argument the brain can be simulated\uf097 technologically feasible to copy the brain directly into hardware and software and that such a simulation will be essentially identical to the original 6 history of artificial intelligence\uf097 classical philosophers\uf097 programmable digital computers 1940\uf097 19431956• mcculloch pitts boolean circuit model of brain• dartmouth meeting artificial intelligence“ name adopted\uf097 the golden years 1956−1974 7 \uf097 1986 rise of machine learning ◦ neural networks return to popularity ◦ major advances in machine learning algorithms and applications\uf097 1995 ai as science ◦ integration of

intelligencewhich include ipl lisp prolog strips planner pop11 etc 12 lisp introductionlisp is a family of computerprogramming languages with a longhistory and a distinctive fullyparenthesized polish prefixnotationthe name lisp derives from listprocessing linked lists are one oflisp languages major datastructures and lisp source code isitself made up of lists as a resultlisp programs can manipulatesource code as a data structuregiving rise to the macro systemsthat allow programmers to createnew syntax or even new domainspecific languages embedded in 13 lisp syntax semantics lisp is an expressionoriented language unlike most other languages no distinction is made between expressions and statements all code and data are written as expressions mccarthys 1958 paper introduced two types of syntax \uf0a7 sexpressions symbolic expressions car cons a b \uf0a7 mexpressions meta expressions carconsab 14 lisp connection to ai \uf0a7 lisp is an important language for artificial intelligence programming \uf0a7 lisp programs define how to perform an algorithm on the expressions \uf0a7 frames networks and objects are responsible for lisp’s popularity in the ai community \uf0a7 lisp is widely used in implementing the tools of artificial intelligence 15 prolog introductionprolog is a general purpose logic programming languageassociated with ai and computational linguistics prolog has its roots in firstorder and formal logic itis declarative and expressed in terms of relationsrepresented as facts and rules 16 prolog syntax semanticsin prolog program logic is expressed in terms ofrelations and a computation is initiated by running aquery over these relationsin syntax and semantics following are considered\uf0a7 data types\uf0a7 rules and facts\uf0a7 evaluation\uf0a7 loops\uf0a7 negation 17 prolog data types\uf0a7 an atom whose meanings is not defined\uf0a7 numbers can be floats or integers\uf0a7 variables are strings consisting of letters numbers and underscore characters and beginning with an uppercase letter or underscore 18 comparison lisp prologfunctional language logical languagegeneral purpose specific useshandles wide variety of tasks easier smaller

search an extensive database to quickly provide the correct answers watson is a prototype for programs or services that can act as knowledgeable assistants or even human substitutes in such different fields as medicine catalog sales and computer technical supportthe introduction of the smartphone has brought aspects of artificial intelligence to cellular telephones most prominently in the voicecontrolled personal assistants that can provide a range of information and recommendations or perform tasks in response to the users voice commands to the schedule maintained by the users calendar application and the like first introduced on the apple smartphone in 2011 such personal assistants have become widely available on smartphones computer tablets personal computers and other electronic devices globalpositioning system gps devices or similar smartphone applications which provide turnbyturn directions as a person drives can redirect the driver in real time to avoid traffic jams and increasingly accept voice commands are another more limited but common utilization of advances in artificial intelligence as are translation and voicerecognition programs selfdriving automobiles whether fully autonomous or acting as an assistant to a human driver are another example of the use of artificial intelligence such vehicles use sensor mapping and gps information to locate where they are rely on sensors and interpretative software to determine what vehicles people objects and the like are nearby and use computercontrolled systems to drive and maneuversee also

2009the subfield of computer science concerned with understanding the nature of intelligence and constructing computer systems capable of intelligent action it embodies the dual motives of furthering basic scientific understanding and making computers more sophisticated in the service of humanitymany activities involve intelligent action—problem solving perception learning planning and other symbolic reasoning creativity language and so forth—and therein lie an immense diversity of phenomena scientific concern for these phenomena is shared by many fields for example psychology linguistics and philosophy of mind in addition to artificial intelligence the starting point for artificial intelligence is the capability of the computer to manipulate symbolic expressions that can represent all manner of things including knowledge about the structure and function of objects and people in the world beliefs and purposes scientific theories and the programs of action of the computer itselfartificial intelligence is primarily concerned with symbolic representations of knowledge and heuristic methods of reasoning that is using common assumptions and rules of thumb two examples of problems studied in artificial intelligence are planning how a robot or person might assemble a complicated device or move from one place to another and diagnosing the nature of a persons disease or of a machines malfunction from the observable manifestations of the problem in both cases reasoning with symbolic descriptions predominates over calculatingthe approach of artificial intelligence researchers is largely experimental with small patches of mathematical theory as in other experimental sciences investigators build devices in this case computer programs to carry out their experimental investigations new programs are created to explore ideas about how intelligent action might be attained and are also developed to test hypotheses about concepts or mechanisms involved in intelligent behaviorthe foundations of artificial intelligence are divided into representation problemsolving methods architecture and knowledge to work on a task a computer must have an internal representation in its memory for example the symbolic description of a room for a moving robot or a set of features describing a person with a disease the representation also includes all the knowledge including basic programs for testing and measuring the structure plus all the programs for transforming the structure into another one in ways appropriate to the task changing the representation used for a task can make an immense difference turning a problem from impossible to trivialgiven the representation of a task a method must be adopted that has some chance of accomplishing the task artificial intelligence has gradually built up a stock of relevant problemsolving methods the socalled weak methods that apply extremely generallyan important feature of all the weak methods is that they involve search one of the most important generalizations to arise in artificial intelligence is the ubiquity of search it appears to underlie all intelligent action in the worst case the search is blind in heuristic search extra information is used to guide the searchsome of the weak methods are generateandtest a sequence of candidates is generated each being tested for solutionhood hill climbing a measure of progress is used to guide each step meansends analysis the difference between the desired situation and the present one is used to select the next step impasse resolution the inability to take the desired next step leads to a subgoal of making the step feasible planning by abstraction the task is simplified solved and the solution used as a guide and matching the present situation is represented as a schema to be mapped into the desired situation by putting the two in correspondencean intelligent agent—person or program—has multiple means for representing tasks and dealing with them also required is an architecture or operating framework within which to select and carry out these activities often called the executive or control structure it is best viewed as a total architecture as in computer architecture that is a machine that provides data structures operations on those data structures memory for holding data structures accessing operations for retrieving data structures from memory a programming language for expressing integrated patterns of conditional operations and an interpreter for carrying out programs any digital computer provides an architecture as does any programming language architectures are not all equivalent and one important scientific question is what architecture is appropriate for a general intelligent agentin artificial intelligence the basic paradigm of intelligent action is that of search through a space of partial solutions called the problem space for a goal situation each step offers several possibilities leading to a cascading of possibilities that can be represented as a branching tree the search is thus said to be combinatorial or exponential for example if there are 10 possible actions in any situation and it takes a sequence of 12 steps to find a solution a goal state then there are 1012 possible sequences in the exhaustive search tree what keeps the search under control is knowledge which suggests how to choose or narrow the options at each step thus the fourth fundamental concern is how to represent knowledge in the memory of the system so it can be brought to bear on the search when relevantan intelligent agent will have immense amounts of knowledge this implies another major problem that of discovering the relevant knowledge as the solution attempt progresses although this search does not include the combinatorial explosion characteristic of searching the problem space it can be time consuming and hard however the structure of the database holding the knowledge called the knowledge base can be carefully tailored to suit the architecture in order to make the search efficient this knowledge base with its accompanying problems of encoding and access constitutes the final ingredient of an intelligent systeman example of artificial intelligence is computer perception perception is the formation from a sensory signal of an internal representation suitable for intelligent processing though there are many types of sensory signals computer perception has focused on vision and speech perception might seem to be distinct from intelligence since it involves incident timevarying continuous energy distributions prior to interpretation in symbolic terms however all the same ingredients occur representation search architecture and knowledge speech perception starts with the acoustic wave of a human utterance and proceeds to an internal representation of what the speech is about a sequence of representations is used the digitization of the acoustic wave into an array of intensities the formation of a small set of parametric quantities that vary continuously with time such as the intensities and frequencies of the formants bands of resonant energy characteristic of speech a sequence of phons members of a finite alphabet of labels for characteristic sounds analogous to letters a sequence of words a parsed sequence of words reflecting grammatical structure and finally a semantic data structure representing a sentence or other utterance that reflects the meaning behind the soundsa class of artificial intelligence programs called expert systems attempt to accomplish tasks by acquiring and incorporating the same knowledge that human experts have many attempts to apply artificial intelligence to medicine government and other socially significant tasks take the form of expert systems even though the emphasis is on knowledge all the standard ingredients are presentin careful tests a number of expert systems have shown performance at levels of quality equivalent to or better than average practicing professionals for example average practicing physicians on the restricted domains over which they operate nearly all large corporations and many smaller ones use expert systems a common application is to provide technical assistance to persons who answer customers trouble calls computer companies use expert systems to assist in configuring components from a parts catalog into a complete system that matches a customers specifications a kind of application that has been replicated in other industries tailoring assembled products to customers needs troubleshooting and diagnostic programs are commonplace another widespread use of this technology is in software for home computers that assists taxpayers one important lesson learned from incorporating artificial intelligence software into ongoing practice is that its success depends on many other aspects besides the intrinsic intellectual quality for example ease of interaction integration into existing workflow and costsexpert systems have sparked important insights in reasoning under uncertainty causal reasoning reasoning about knowledge and acceptance of computer systems in the workplace they illustrate that there is no hard separation between pure and applied artificial intelligence finding what is required for intelligent action in a complex applied area makes a significant contribution to basic knowledge see expert systemsin addition to the subject areas mentioned above significant work in artificial intelligence has been done on puzzles and reasoning tasks induction and concept identification symbolic mathematics theorem proving in formal logic natural language understanding and generation vision robotics chemistry biology engineering analysis computerhyphenassisted instruction and computerprogram synthesis and verification to name only the most prominent as computers become smaller and less

industrial robots mimic the movements and seemingly the intentionality of human workerstoday’s robots are not only working faster and more reliably than their human counterparts but also performing tasks beyond human capability altogether such as microscopically precise assembly but many of those robots are dumber than they look that is they may be more dexterous than humans but they are programmed to perform a limited range of tasks many robots can’t safely work in close proximity to humans and literally have to be caged or regulated in ways that safeguard human coworkersartificial intelligence ai is just now finding its niche in manufacturing as the technology matures and costs drop—and as manufacturers discover applications for which ai algorithms can make complex decisions and as it becomes ubiquitous the future of artificial intelligence in manufacturing is already becoming feasible in emerging markets showcasing better sensory capabilities and off the factory floor predicting what will be needed and whenin manufacturing capital investments are high and profit margins are often thin those conditions helped to drive a lot of manufacturing to lowwage countries where the humanresource costs have been so low that the capital investment in ai and related automation was hard to justify but rising living standards and wages in places like india have made ai an easier sell in fact china is already making significant investments in ai for manufacturing and ecommerceand just as us workers have lamented loss of jobs to automation the same is now happening in chinese factories although many workers will be replaced by robots in the short term the end game will be to retrain those workers to perform higherlevel design programming or maintenance tasks the real driver however will be to develop applications for ai in manufacturing that don’t just automate tasks but make entirely new business processes feasible—for example custom configuration of products to individual customer requirementsai has its roots in the 1950s but only found broad acceptance with the development of machinelearning algorithms that could be loosed on a body of data to discover meaningful patterns—without deliberate programming “without flexible algorithms computers can only do what we tell them” says michael mendelson a curriculum developer at the nvidia deep learning institute “many tasks especially those involving perception can’t be translated into rulebased instructions in a manufacturing context some of the more immediately interesting applications will involve perception” this would make factory robots more capable and better able to interact with—and take instructions from—humansmachine vision is one of these applications devising cameras many times more sensitive than the human eye has been the easy part what ai adds is the increasingly useful ability to make sense of the images landingai a startup formed by silicon valley veteran andrew ng focuses on manufacturing problems such as precise quality analysis it has developed machinevision tools to find microscopic defects in products such as circuit boards at resolutions well beyond human vision using a machinelearning algorithm trained on remarkably small volumes of sample imagesthat’s a microlevel challenge a macrolevel problem is training a robot to sense what is going on around it so that it can avoid disruptions or danger this is analogous to the selfdrivingvehicle problem which is nearing realworld adoption there is a likely role in factories for smart selfdriving forklifts and conveyors to move materials and finished goods aroundrobots often are stationary but are still at risk of crashing into things or people wandering into their workspaces machine vision or motion sensors can cause robots to stop what they are doing if there is a potential obstruction but there is increasing demand for truly collaborative robots—“cobots”—that can work productively with human colleagues ai is enabling them to take instructions from humans including novel instructions not anticipated in the robot’s original programming for this robots and humans need a common language which could increasingly be plain speech this concept already has been demonstrated at the university of rochester and at mit“as humans we’ve got millennia of practice explaining things to each other verbally while written word is a much newer and often clunkier technology” mendelson says “talking to robots allows us to communicate concepts that we might not be able to as clearly with text”ai certainly is making robots more capable and easier for humans to collaborate with but it will have an impact in areas that have nothing to do with robotics in the supply chain for example algorithms can perceive patterns of demand for products across time geographic markets and socioeconomic segments while accounting for macroeconomic cycles political developments and even weather patterns the output can be a projection of market demand which in turn could drive raw material sourcing human staffing financing decisions inventory maintenance of equipment and energy consumptionin manufacturing ai is also increasingly important in predictive maintenance for equipment with sensors tracking operating conditions and performance of factory tooling learning to predict breakdowns and malfunctions and taking or recommending preemptive actions “in other industries this is already straightforward” says som shahapurkar director of machine learning at fico which has been commercializing ai for more than 40 years “the application has spread across domains from generating sophisticated consumer email alerts to automobile owners to failure prediction in ‘blades’ in server farms at facebook and google”much of the data will come from sensors embedded in the processing equipment not only at the factory but also at suppliers’ facilities tracking parts inventories and other frontend inputs and monitoring productquality issues at distributor locations or retail outletsai can in fact provide clues to help manufacturers predict demand before they build products to fill the pipeline in 2010 informatics professor johan bollen and colleagues at indiana university demonstrated that algorithms could read and interpret sentiment in twitter feeds precisely enough to accurately predict stockmarket movements similar sentiment analyses could be used to project demand for products or even specific brands bollen says especially now that consumers are transmitting their sentiments daily by chatting with household ai assistants from google and amazon much of bollen’s recent work has been focused on socialmedia influence on political opinions but he has studied consumer behavior as wellstill ai’s proponents assert that the technology is only an evolutionary form of automation an inevitable outcome of the fourth industrial revolution in the future ai may be effective at making things making them better and making them cheaper but there is no substitute for human ingenuity in dealing with the unexpected changes in tastes and demands—or in deciding whether to make things at

intelligence also known as ai is a 2001 american science fiction drama film directed by steven spielberg the screenplay by spielberg and screen story by ian watson were loosely based on the 1969 short story supertoys last all summer long by brian aldiss the film was produced by kathleen kennedy spielberg and bonnie curtis it stars haley joel osment jude law frances oconnor brendan gleeson and william hurt set in a futuristic postclimate change society ai tells the story of david osment a childlike android uniquely programmed with the ability to lovedevelopment of ai originally began with producerdirector stanley kubrick after he acquired the rights to aldiss story in the early 1970s kubrick hired a series of writers until the mid1990s including brian aldiss bob shaw ian watson and sara maitland the film languished in protracted development for years partly because kubrick felt computergenerated imagery was not advanced enough to create the david character whom he believed no child actor would convincingly portray in 1995 kubrick handed ai to spielberg but the film did not gain momentum until kubricks death in 1999 spielberg remained close to watsons film treatment for the screenplaythe film received positive reviews and grossed approximately 235 million the film was nominated for two academy awards at the 74th academy awards for best visual effects and best original score by john williamsin a 2016 bbc poll of 177 critics around the world steven spielbergs ai artificial intelligence was voted the eightythirdgreatest film since 20003 ai is dedicated to stanley kubrickin the late 22nd century rising sea levels from global warming have wiped out coastal cities such as amsterdam venice and new york and drastically reduced the worlds population a new type of robots called mecha advanced humanoids capable of displaying thought and emotion have been createdin madison david a mecha that resembles a human child and is programmed to display love for his owners is given to henry swinton and his wife monica whose son martin after contracting a rare disease has been placed in suspended animation and is not expected to recover monica feels uneasy with david but eventually warms to him and activates his imprinting protocol causing him to have an enduring childlike love for her david is befriended by teddy a robotic teddy bear that belonged to martinmartin is unexpectedly cured of his disease and brought home as he recovers he grows jealous of david he tricks david into entering the parentss bedroom at night and cutting off a lock of monicas hair this upsets the parents particularly henry who fears david intended to injure them at a pool party one of martins friends pokes david with a knife activating davids selfprotection programming david grabs martin and they fall into the pool martin is saved from drowning but henry persuades monica to return david to his creators for destruction instead she abandons david and teddy in the forest she warns david to avoid all humans and tells him to find other unregistered mecha who can protect himdavid is captured for an antimecha flesh fair outside haddonfield where obsolete unlicensed mecha are destroyed before cheering crowds david is placed on a platform with gigolo joe a male sex worker mecha who is on the run after being framed for murder before the pair can be destroyed with acid the crowd thinking david is a real boy since he unlike other mechas desperately cries begins booing and throwing things at the shows emcee in the chaos david and joe escape since joe survived thanks to david he agrees to help him find blue fairy whom david remembers from the adventures of pinocchio and believes can turn him into a real boy allowing monica to love him and take him homejoe and david make their way to the decadent resort town of rouge city where dr know a holographic answer engine directs them to the top of rockefeller center in the flooded ruins of manhattan there david meets a copy of himself and destroys it he then meets professor hobby his creator who tells david he was built in the image of the professors dead son david the engineers are thrilled by his ability to have a will without being programmed he reveals they have been monitoring him to see how he progresses and altered dr know to guide him to manhattan back to the lab he was created in david finds more copies of him as well as female versions called darlene that have been made theredisheartened david lets himself fall from a ledge of the building he is rescued by joe flying an amphibicopter he has stolen from the police who were pursuing him david tells joe he saw the blue fairy underwater and wants to go down to meet her joe is captured by the authorities who snare him with an electromagnet before he is pulled up he activates the amphibicopters dive function for david telling him to remember him for he declares i am i was david and teddy dive to see the fairy which turns out to be a statue at the nowsunken coney island the two become trapped when the wonder wheel falls on their vehicle david repeatedly asks the fairy to turn him into a real boy eventually the ocean freezes and davids power source is depletedtwo thousand years later humans are extinct and manhattan is buried under glacial ice the mecha have evolved into an advanced siliconbased form called specialists they find david and teddy and discover they are original mecha who knew living humans making them special the specialists revive david and teddy david walks to the frozen fairy statue which collapses when he touches it the mecha use davids memories to reconstruct the swinton home david asks the specialists if they can make him human but they cannot however he insists they recreate monica from dna from the lock of her hair which teddy has kept the mecha warn david that the clone can live for only a day and that the process cannot be repeated david spends a joyous day with monica and teddy at the end of which\u200d—\u200cbefore she drifts off to sleep\u200d—\u200cmonica tells david i do love you i have always loved you david falls asleep as wellkubrick began development on an adaptation of supertoys last all summer long in the late 1970s hiring the storys author brian aldiss to write a film treatment in 1985 kubrick asked steven spielberg to direct the film with kubrick producing6 warner bros agreed to cofinance ai and cover distribution duties7 the film labored in development hell and aldiss was fired by kubrick over creative differences in 19898 bob shaw briefly served as writer leaving after six weeks due to kubricks demanding work schedule and ian watson was hired as the new writer in march 1990 aldiss later remarked not only did the bastard fire me he hired my enemy watson instead kubrick handed watson the adventures of pinocchio for inspiration calling ai a picaresque robot version of pinocchio79three weeks later watson gave kubrick his first story treatment and concluded his work on ai in may 1991 with another treatment of 90 pages gigolo joe was originally conceived as a gi mecha but watson suggested changing him to a male sex worker kubrick joked i guess we lost the kiddie market7 meanwhile kubrick dropped ai to work on a film adaptation of wartime lies feeling computer animation was not advanced enough to create the david character however after the release of spielbergs jurassic park with its innovative computergenerated imagery it was announced in november 1993 that production of ai would begin in 199410 dennis muren and ned gorman who worked on jurassic park became visual effects supervisors8 but kubrick was displeased with their previsualization and with the expense of hiring industrial light magic11– producer jan harlan on spielbergs first meeting with kubrick about ai12in early 1994 the film was in preproduction with christopher fangorn baker as concept artist and sara maitland assisting on the story which gave it a feminist fairytale focus7 maitland said that kubrick never referred to the film as ai but as pinocchio11 chris cunningham became the new visual effects supervisor some of his unproduced work for ai can be seen on the dvd the work of director chris cunningham13 aside from considering computer animation kubrick also had joseph mazzello do a screen test for the lead role11 cunningham helped assemble a series of little robottype humans for the david character we tried to construct a little boy with a movable rubber face to see whether we could make it look appealing producer jan harlan reflected but it was a total failure it looked awful hans moravec was brought in as a technical consultant11 meanwhile kubrick and harlan thought ai would be closer to steven spielbergs sensibilities as director1415 kubrick handed the position to spielberg in 1995 but spielberg chose to direct other projects and convinced kubrick to remain as director1216 the film was put on hold due to kubricks commitment to eyes wide shut 199917 after the filmmakers death in march 1999 harlan and christiane kubrick approached spielberg to take over the directors position1819 by november 1999 spielberg was writing the screenplay based on watsons 90page story treatment it was his first solo screenplay credit since close encounters of the third kind 197720 spielberg remained close to watsons treatment but removed various sex scenes with gigolo joe preproduction was briefly halted during february 2000 because spielberg pondered directing other projects which were harry potter and the philosophers stone minority report and memoirs of a geisha1721 the following month spielberg announced that ai would be his next project with minority report as a followup22 when he decided to fast track ai spielberg brought chris baker back as concept artist16the original start date was july 10 200015 but filming was delayed until august23 aside from a couple of weeks shooting on location in oxbow regional park in oregon ai was shot entirely using sound stages at warner bros studios and the spruce goose dome in long beach california24 the swinton house was constructed on stage 16 while stage 20 was used for rouge city and other sets2526 spielberg copied kubricks obsessively secretive approach to filmmaking by refusing to give the complete script to cast and crew banning press from the set and making actors sign confidentiality agreements social robotics expert cynthia breazeal served as technical consultant during production1527 haley joel osment and jude law applied prosthetic makeup daily in an attempt to look shinier and robotic4 costume designer bob ringwood studied pedestrians on the las vegas strip for his influence on the rouge city extras28 spielberg found postproduction on ai difficult because he was simultaneously preparing to shoot minority report29the films soundtrack was released by warner sunset records in 2001 the original score was composed and conducted by john williams and featured singers lara fabian on two songs and josh groban on one the films score also had a limited release as an official for your consideration academy promo as well as a complete score issue by lala land records in 201530 the band ministry appears in the film playing the song what about us but the song does not appear on the official soundtrack albumwarner bros used an alternate reality game titled the beast to promote the film over forty websites were created by atomic pictures in new york city kept online at cloudmakersorg including the website for cybertronics corp there were to be a series of video games for the xbox video game console that followed the storyline of the beast but they went undeveloped to avoid audiences mistaking ai for a family film no action figures were created although hasbro released a talking teddy following the films release in june 200115ai had its premiere at the venice film festival in 200131ai artificial intelligence was released on vhs and dvd in the us by dreamworks home entertainment on march 5 200232 in widescreen and fullscreen 2disc special editions featuring an eightpart documentary detailing the films development production music and visual effects the bonus features also included interviews with haley joel osment jude law frances oconnor steven spielberg and john williams two teaser trailers for the films original theatrical release and an extensive photo gallery featuring production sills and stanley kubricks original storyboards33 it was released overseas by warner home videothe film was first released on bluray disc in japan by warner home video on december 22 2010 followed shortly after with a us release by paramount home media distribution current owners of the dreamworks catalog on april 5 2011 this bluray

on june 29 2001 earning 29352630 during its opening weekend ai went on to gross 7862 million in us totals as well as 15731 million in foreign countries coming to a worldwide total of 23593 million35based on 192 reviews collected by rotten tomatoes 73 of critics gave the film positive notices with a score of 6610 the websites critical consensus reads a curious not always seamless amalgamation of kubricks chilly bleakness and spielbergs warmhearted optimism ai is in a word fascinating36 by comparison metacritic collected an average score of 65 based on 32 reviews which is considered favorable37producer jan harlan stated that kubrick would have applauded the final film while kubricks widow christiane also enjoyed ai38 brian aldiss admired the film as well i thought what an inventive intriguing ingenious involving film this was there are flaws in it and i suppose i might have a personal quibble but its so long since i wrote it of the films ending he wondered how it might have been had kubrick directed the film that is one of the ifs of film history—at least the ending indicates spielberg adding some sugar to kubricks wine the actual ending is overly sympathetic and moreover rather overtly engineered by a plot device that does not really bear credence but its a brilliant piece of film and of course its a phenomenon because it contains the energies and talents of two brilliant filmmakers39 richard corliss heavily praised spielbergs direction as well as the cast and visual effects40 roger ebert gave the film three stars saying that it was wonderful and maddening41 leonard maltin on the other hand gives the film two stars out of four in his movie guide writing the intriguing story draws us in thanks in part to osments exceptional performance but takes several wrong turns ultimately it just doesnt work spielberg rewrote the adaptation stanley kubrick commissioned of the brian aldiss short story super toys last all summer long the result is a curious and uncomfortable hybrid of kubrick and spielberg sensibilities however he calls john williams music score striking jonathan rosenbaum compared ai to solaris 1972 and praised both kubrick for proposing that spielberg direct the project and spielberg for doing his utmost to respect kubricks intentions while making it a profoundly personal work42 film critic armond white of the new york press praised the film noting that each part of davids journey through carnal and sexual universes into the final eschatological devastation becomes as profoundly philosophical and contemplative as anything by cinemas most thoughtful speculative artists – borzage ozu demy tarkovsky43 filmmaker billy wilder hailed ai as the most underrated film of the past few years44 when british filmmaker ken russell saw the film he wept during the ending45mick lasalle gave a largely negative review ai exhibits all its creators bad traits and none of the good so we end up with the structureless meandering slowmotion endlessness of kubrick combined with the fuzzy cuddly mindlessness of spielberg dubbing it spielbergs first boring movie lasalle also believed the robots at the end of the film were aliens and compared gigolo joe to the useless jar jar binks yet praised robin williams for his portrayal of a futuristic albert einstein46not in citation given peter travers gave a mixed review concluding spielberg cannot live up to kubricks darker side of the future but he still put the film on his top ten list that year for best movies47 david denby in the new yorker criticized ai for not adhering closely to his concept of the pinocchio character spielberg responded to some of the criticisms of the film stating that many of the so called sentimental elements of ai including the ending were in fact kubricks and the darker elements were his own48 however sara maitland who worked on the project with kubrick in the 1990s claimed that one of the reasons kubrick never started production on ai was because he had a hard time making the ending work49 james berardinelli found the film consistently involving with moments of nearbrilliance but far from a masterpiece in fact as the longawaited collaboration of kubrick and spielberg it ranks as something of a disappointment of the films highly debated finale he claimed there is no doubt that the concluding 30 minutes are all spielberg the outstanding question is where kubricks vision left off and spielbergs began50screenwriter ian watson has speculated worldwide ai was very successful and the 4thhighest earner of the year but it didnt do quite so well in america because the film so im told was too poetical and intellectual in general for american tastes plus quite a few critics in america misunderstood the film thinking for instance that the giacomettistyle beings in the final 20 minutes were aliens whereas they were robots of the future who had evolved themselves from the robots in the earlier part of the film and also thinking that the final 20 minutes were a sentimental addition by spielberg whereas those scenes were exactly what i wrote for stanley and exactly what he wanted filmed faithfully by spielberg51 despite mr watsons reference to worldwide box office of 4th the movie actually finished 16th worldwide among 2001 movie releases52in 2002 spielberg told film critic joe leydon that people pretend to think they know stanley kubrick and think they know me when most of them dont know either of us and whats really funny about that is all the parts of ai that people assume were stanleys were mine and all the parts of ai that people accuse me of sweetening and softening and sentimentalizing were all stanleys the teddy bear was stanleys the whole last 20 minutes of the movie was completely stanleys the whole first 35 40 minutes of the film—all the stuff in the house—was word for word from stanleys screenplay this was stanleys vision eighty percent of the critics got it all mixed up but i could see why because obviously ive done a lot of movies where people have cried and have been sentimental and ive been accused of sentimentalizing hardcore material but in fact it was stanley who did the sweetest parts of ai not me im the guy who did the dark center of the movie with the flesh fair and everything else thats why he wanted me to make the movie in the first place he said this is much closer to your sensibilities than my own53 he also added while there was divisiveness when ai came out i felt that i had achieved stanley’s wishes or goals54upon rewatching the film many years after its release bbc film critic mark kermode apologized to spielberg in an interview in january 2013 for getting it wrong on the film when he first viewed it in 2001 he now believes the film to be spielbergs enduring masterpiece55visual effects supervisors dennis muren stan winston michael lantieri and scott farrar were nominated for the academy award for best visual effects while john williams was nominated for best original music score56 steven spielberg jude law and williams received nominations at the 59th golden globe awards57 ai was successful at the saturn awards winning five awards

answer of sorts thanks to the work of katja grace at the future of humanity institute at the university of oxford and a few pals to find out these guys asked the experts they surveyed the world’s leading researchers in artificial intelligence by asking them when they think intelligent machines will better humans in a wide range of tasks and many of the answers are something of a surprisethe experts that grace and co coopted were academics and industry experts who gave papers at the international conference on machine learning in july 2015 and the neural information processing systems conference in december 2015 these are two of the most important events for experts in artificial intelligence so it’s a good bet that many of the world’s experts were on this listgrace and co asked them all—1634 of them—to fill in a survey about when artificial intelligence would be better and cheaper than humans at a variety of tasks of these experts 352 responded grave and co then calculated their median responsesthe experts predict that ai will outperform humans in the next 10 years in tasks such as translating languages by 2024 writing high school essays by 2026 and driving trucks by 2027but many other tasks will take much longer for machines to master ai won’t be better than humans at working in retail until 2031 able to write a bestselling book until 2049 or capable of working as a surgeon until 2053the experts are far from infallible they predicted that ai would be better than humans at go by about 2027 this was in 2015 remember in fact google’s deepmind subsidiary has already developed an artificial intelligence capable of beating the best humans that took two years rather than 12 it’s easy to think that this gives the lie to these predictionsthe experts go on to predict a 50 percent chance that ai will be better than humans at more or less everything in about 45 yearsthat’s the kind of prediction that needs to be taken with a pinch of salt the 40year prediction horizon should always raise alarm bells according to some energy experts costeffective fusion energy is about 40 years away—but it always has been it was 40 years away when researchers first explored fusion more than 50 years ago but it has stayed a distant dream because the challenges have turned out to be more significant than anyone imaginedforty years is an important number when humans make predictions because it is the length of most people’s working lives so any predicted change that is further away than that means the change will happen beyond the working lifetime of everyone who is working today in other words it cannot happen with any technology that today’s experts have any practical experience with that suggests it is a number to be treated with cautionbut teasing apart the numbers shows something interesting this 45year prediction is the median figure from all the experts perhaps some subset of this group is more expert than the othersto find out if different groups made different predictions grace and co looked at how the predictions changed with the age of the researchers the number of their citations ie their expertise and their region of originit turns out that age and expertise make no difference to the prediction but origin does while north american researchers expect ai to outperform humans at everything in 74 years researchers from asia expect it in just 30 yearsthat’s a big difference that is hard to explain and it raises an interesting question what do asian researchers know that north americans don’t or vice versaref

nasdaqnvda and microsoft corporation nasdaqmsft come to mind — and well they shouldnvidia’s graphics processing hardware has proven an ideal way to complete the intensive numbercrunching required by most ai applications and microsoft has arguably acquired a number of artificial intelligence companies garnering some new and impressive technologies it has yet to turn into a practical product those products are in the works thoughmany more organizations have waded into artificial intelligence waters however — more than you might realize a bunch of them are smaller and perhaps even unknown names that doesn’t make them inferior ai stocks however indeed many of these unknown names rank among the best artificial intelligence stocks available to investors todaywith that as the backdrop here’s a rundown of three ai names you may not have realized were artificial intelligence plays — if you realized they existed at allxilinx inc nasdaqxlnx isn’t exactly off the radar on the other hand with a modest market cap of 17 billion it’s not exactly turning a lot of heads eithergive it time thoughxilinx for the unfamiliar makes a variety of technologies that connect usually dissimilar things that can mean a lot of course but xilinx does a lot of different things its big claim to fame within the world of ai stocks is the development of highperformance fpgas or field programmable gate arraysfpgas can be as the name suggests programmed and reprogrammed on the fly by a coder that needs a device to do something not previously foreseen that’s in contrast with asic chips or applicationspecific integrated circuits which can only be programmed once at the time as they’re being manufacturedit seems like a minor benefit but the flexibility of fpgas has proven indispensable in many machinelearning environments and edge computing in particularit’s not the highend artificial applications like selfdriving vehicles rather much of xilinx’s wares are the lowbrow stuff like managing sensors that make internet of things networks work as they should that’s where the tangible practical opportunity is thoughbaidu inc adr nasdaqbidu the same baidu that’s usually described as the “google of china” is also an artificial intelligence stock yep in fact it may quietly be one of the best artificial intelligence stocks one can ownto be clear ai is still a very small sliver of what the company does its meatandpotatoes business is still advertising revenue generated operating china’s preferred search engine just like its western counterpart though it’s branching out into other opportunities knowing there will come a time when online ads are no longer a growth enginethat said baidu ceo robin li has made no bones about it baidu is now an aifirst company whatever that ends up meaningone such practical even if bold effort is the development of an opensource autonomous driving platform called apollo the platform’s openness to all developers and tweaks has proven popular with potential partners in the meantime baidu has created some more practical artificial intelligence tools like a smart speaker dubbed little fish vs1 yes it’s akin to the echo from amazoncom inc nasdaqamzn the underlying technology powering the little fish holds tremendous promise as the digital backbone for a whole host of iot devicesyext inclast but certainly not least put yext inc nyseyext on your list of artificial intelligence stocks worth a lookthe short version of a long story while many ai developers are proverbially swinging for the fences in hopes of a payoff down the road yext is creating practical aidriven services here and now specifically yext has developed ways to turn the mountains of data most companies are now collecting into actionable intelligenceat first glance it might not even look like true artificial intelligence it may look and feel more like a wellplanned means of repackaging information that already exists in a difficulttouse format take a closer look though and one can see that its platform understands certain contexts and its aipowered chatbot for use by client companies wouldn’t function properly just using a mere scriptsexy not in

democratic presidential candidate has thought through issues big and small and because he has crossed the 65000 individual donor threshold to participate in the democratic debates we’ll likely be hearing more about his ideas in the next year“the american people are very smart and they realize there are genuine problems that got donald trump elected and that we’re in the midst of this incredible economic transformation and no one’s talking about it” says yang “i think that’s why my campaign has caught fire the last couple weeks”when we sat down with yang his donor list had expanded to 80000 donors albeit small donors who he jokes “are cheaper than bernie’s” donors to sen bernie sanders’s campaign the day he announced in 2016 gave an average of 27 yang’s average donor gives 19 although he is barely registering support or name recognition in early polls he’s garnering buzz on social media where fans show support under yanggangthe 44year old yang was born in schenectady ny the son of taiwanese immigrants his father was a researcher at ibm his mother a systems administrator at a local university a product of the prep school and ivy league pipeline yang briefly practiced law before becoming an entrepreneur after launching a few startups with mixed success yang founded the nonprofit venture for america a fellowship program to place recent college graduates at startups and help them launch their own businesses a selfdescribed nerd who asks what better foil is there to trump than “an asian man who’s good at math” yang has done his homework he rattles off numbers hard data and statistical projections to enforce his policy positions which are copious to say the leastyang2020’s website lists more than 80 policy positions including boilerplate stances in line with mainstream democrats on “medicare for all” gun control and criminal justice reform his more obscure stances include setting up a robocall complaint hotline that could lead to fcc fines and a plan to tackle divorce rates by mandating that health insurers provide family counseling in their plans yang may be asking the right questions but some of his proposed solutions seem like candidacy killers — politically nonviable and nichetake for example one of the ways yang would address climate change if he were in the white house while he is in favor of a carbon tax plan that has been floated by moderate democrats and republicans he also supports a highly controversial approach to lowering the earth’s temperature through direct technical means known as geoengineeringaccording to the union of concerned scientists geoengineering or climate engineering involves the “intentional largescale intervention in the earth’s climate system to counter climate change” the term encompasses more benign and agreedupon technologies such as carbon capture and lowtech solutions such as planting trees but also concepts like solar radiation management which could extend to placing mirrors in space to reflect the sun’s radiation away from earth or setting off volcanic eruptions to spread sunreflecting aerosols into the stratosphere critics including the union of concerned scientists say these unproven technologies could interfere with natural systems with unforeseen consequences and run the risk of setting off geopolitical conflicts yang argues the conventional proposals to solve climate change are too incremental“we have to face facts that we are in all likelihood going to be facing a warming planet rising sea levels different weather patterns and we need to start thinking bigger about how we’re going to mitigate these effects” says yang “we’re messing with mother nature right now … in a catastrophic fashion and we have to at least explore what we have to do to blunt the worst effects for our civilization”yang’s plans to tackle climate change aren’t his only ideas far outside the box he is reviving a 1970sera concept that would guarantee every american monthly income from the federal government repackaging it as a solution to job losses from automation and artificial intelligenceas with climate change yang’s signature economic policy — a universal basic income — assumes that the world is already on a trajectory toward the most devastating outcomes many economists are warning that superintelligent computers will displace millions of workers by 2030 but yang’s view is even more dire he believes for example that the current generation of selfdriving technology could replace millions of truck drivers in the next five to 10 years which would lead to “epic levels of distress displacement and even violence”in 10 trips each to iowa and new hampshire yang is targeting voters who would be most affected by automation workingclass americans without college degrees offering them a seemingly farfetched promise if they make him president he will give every american over the age of 18 a check for 1000 a month no strings attached the monthly income would ease the transition to joblessness but the impact would be wider he says — addressing problems as broad as the mental health epidemic the education gap and persistent poverty and as specific as helping battered women escape abusive spouses and compensating people who drop out of the workforce to take care of children or elderly relatives“people realize there’s nothing stopping the members of a democracy from voting ourselves a dividend” says yang “we’re the richest and most advanced economy in the history of the world our economy is about 20 trillion we can easily afford a dividend of a thousand dollars per american”he would pay for the massive 3 trillion program in part with a valueadded tax on tech companies but balancing a yang budget also requires optimism that a monthly paycheck for every american would be a massive economic stimulus — leading to job creation more spending and eventually increased tax revenue he also believes the stipend would lower government bills for things like homelessness emergency room visits and incarceration watch video for more details of yang’s ubi planas hawkish as yang is on the imminent dangers of automation he is a foreignpolicy dove and his asianamerican identity seems to play into his nuanced view on the trump administration’s increasingly antagonistic relationship with china in the competition for cyber superiority during a talk to members of the asianamerican community earlier this year yang made an astounding assertion about the potential fallout from confrontation with china “we’re probably one generation from americans shooting up a bunch of asians saying ‘damn the chinese’ because there’s a giant cold war with china that’s the great danger i fear my children are going to grow up in”yang clarified his remarks in his yahoo news interview saying they were meant to motivate asianamericans who have been “politically disengaged” however the comments are consistent with yang’s view that us politicians are intentionally framing china as an antagonist when it should be seen as a potential collaborator on big issues that cross national boundaries including ai and climate changewhile he acknowledges that china’s pirating of intellectual property is costing us businesses billions of dollars and must be resolved he refutes “the traditional american lens that has been if someone is rising we must be falling”“the goal is not always to be ahead of china” says yang “the goal is to be strong enough so that we can maintain a cooperative relationship with china as one of the leaders”yang’s worldview is at once fearful and optimistic his policies are underpinned with an anxiety about present realities and a future when an explosion of aiequipped automatons will deepen all the divisions in american

was first proposed in the 1950s defined as the part of computer science concerned with designing systems that exhibit the characteristics associated with human intelligence—understanding language learning reasoning solving problems and so on barr and feigenbaum 1981—the field has attracted researchers because of its ambitious goals and enormous underlying intellectual challenges the field has been controversial because of its social ethical and philosophical implications such controversy has affected the funding environment for ai and the objectives of many research programsai research is conducted by a range of scientists and technologists with varying perspectives interests and motivations scientists tend to be interested in understanding the underlying basis of intelligence and cognition some with an emphasis on unraveling the mysteries of human thought and others examining intelligence more broadly engineeringoriented researchers by contrast are interested in building systems that behave intelligently some attempt to build systems using techniques analogous to those used by humans whereas others apply a range of techniques adopted from fields such as information theory electrical engineering statistics and pattern recognition those in the latter category often do not necessarily consider themselves ai researchers but rather fall into a broader category of researchers interested in machine intelligencethe concept of ai originated in the private sector but the growth ofthe field both intellectually and in the size of the research community has depended largely on public investments public monies have been invested in a range of ai programs from fundamental longterm research into cognition to shorterterm efforts to develop operational systems most of the federal support has come from the defense advanced research projects agency darpa known during certain periods as arpa and other units of the department of defense dod other funding agencies have included the national institutes of health national science foundation and national aeronautics and space administration nasa which have pursued ai applications of particular relevance to their missions—health care scientific research and space explorationthis chapter highlights key trends in the development of the field of ai and the important role of federal investments the sections of this chapter presented in roughly chronological order cover the launching of the ai field the governments initial participation the pivotal role played by darpa the success of speech recognition research the shift from basic to applied research and ai in the 1990s the final section summarizes the lessons to be learned from history this case study is based largely on published accounts the scientific and technical literature reports by the major ai research centers and interviews conducted with several leaders of ai research centers little information was drawn from the records of the participants in the field funding agencies editors and publishers and other primary sources most valued by professional historian1the origins of ai research are intimately linked with two landmark papers on chess playing by machine2 they were written in 1950 by claude e shannon a mathematician at bell laboratories who is widely acknowledged as a principal creator of information theory in the late 1930s while still a graduate student he developed a method for symbolic analysis of switching systems and networks shannon 1938 which provided scientists and engineers with muchimproved analytical and conceptual tools after working at bell labs for half a decade shannon published a paper on information theory shannon 1948 shortly thereafter he published two articles outlining the construction or programming of a computer for playing chess shannon 1950abshannons work inspired a young mathematician john mccarthy who while a research instructor in mathematics at princeton university joined shannon in 1952 in organizing a conference on automata studies largely to promote symbolic modeling and work on the theory of machine intelligence3 a year later shannon arranged for mccarthy and anotherfuture pioneer in ai marvin minsky then a graduate student in mathematics at princeton and a participant in the 1952 conference to work with him at bell laboratories during 19534by 1955 mccarthy believed that the theory of machine intelligence was sufficiently advanced and that related work involved such a critical mass of researchers that rapid progress could be promoted by a concentrated summer seminar at dartmouth university where he was then an assistant professor of mathematics he approached the rockefeller foundations warren weaver also a mathematician and a promoter of cuttingedge science as well as shannons collaborator on information theory weaver and his colleague robert s morison director for biological and medical research were initially skeptical weaver 1955 morison pushed mccarthy and shannon to widen the range of participants and made other suggestions mccarthy and shannon responded with a widened proposal that needed much of morisons advice they brought in minsky and a wellknown industrial researcher nathaniel rochester5 of ibm as coprincipal investigators for the proposal submitted in september 19556in the proposal the four researchers declared that the summer study was to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it they sought to bring a number of us scholars to dartmouth to create a research agenda for ai and begin actual work on it in spite of morisons skepticism the rockefeller foundation agreed to fund this summer project with a grant of 7500 rhind 1955 primarily to cover summer salaries and expenses of the academic participants researchers from industry would be compensated by their respective firmsalthough most accounts of ai history focus on mccarthys entrepreneurship the role of shannon—an intellectual leader from industry—is also critical without his participation mccarthy would not have commanded the attention he received from the rockefeller foundation shannon also had considerable influence on marvin minsky the title of minskys 1954 doctoral dissertation was neural nets and the brain model problemthe role of ibm is similarly important nathan rochester was a strong supporter of the ai concept and he and his ibm colleagues who attended the 1956 dartmouth workshop contributed to the early research in the field after the workshop ibm welcomed mccarthy to its research laboratories in large part because of ibms previous work in ai and because ibm looked like a good bet to pursue artificial intelligence research vigorously in the future7 rochester was a visiting professor at the massachusetts institute of technology mit during 19581959 and he unquestionably helped mccarthy with the development of lisp an important listprocessing language see box 918 rochester also apparently lent his support to the creation in 1958 of the mit artificial intelligence project rochester and gelertner 19589 yet in spite of the early activity of rochester and other ibm researchers the corporations interest in ai cooled although work continued on computerbased checkers and chess an internal report prepared about 1960 took a strong position against broad support for aithus the activities surrounding the dartmouth workshop were at the outset linked with the cuttingedge research at a leading private research laboratory att bell laboratories and a rapidly emerging industrial giant ibm researchers at bell laboratories and ibm nurtured the earliest work in ai and gave young academic researchers like mccarthy and minsky credibility that might otherwise have been lacking moreover the dartmouth summer research project in ai was funded by private philanthropy and by industry not by government the same is true for much of the research that led up to the summer projectthe federal governments initial involvement in ai research was manifested in the work of herbert simon and allen newell who attended the 1956 dartmouth workshop to report on complex information processing trained in political science and economics at the university of chicago simon had moved to carnegie institute of technology in 1946 and was instrumental in the founding and early research of the graduate school of industrial administration gsia funded heavily by the ford foundation and the office of naval research onr and the air force gsia was the pioneer in bringing quantitative behavioral social sciences research including operations research into graduate management education10 because of his innovative work in human decision making simon became in march 1951 a consultant to the rand corporation the pioneering think tank established by the air force shortly after world war ii11at rand where he spent several summers carrying out collaborative research simon encountered newell a mathematician who helped to conceive and develop the systems research laboratory which was spun out of rand as the system development corporation in 1957 in 1955 simon and newell began a long collaboration on the simulation of human thought which by the summer of 1956 had resulted in their fundamental work with rand computer programmer jc shaw on the logic theorist a computer program capable of proving theorems found in thebox 91 the development and influence of lisplisp has been an important programming language in ai research and its history demonstrates the more general benefits resulting from the efforts of ai researchers to tackle exceptionally difficult problems as with other developments in ai lisp demonstrates how in addressing problems in the representation and computational treatment of knowledge ai researchers often stretched the limits of computing technology and were forced to invent new techniques that found their way into mainstream applicationearly ai researchers interested in logical reasoning and problem solving needed tools to represent logical formulas proofs plans and computations on such objects existing programming techniques were very awkward for this purpose inspiring the development of specialized programming languages such as listprocessing languages list structures provide a simple and universal encoding of the expressions that arise in symbolic logic formal language theory and their applications to the formalization of reasoning and natural language understanding among early listprocessing languages the name is based on that phrase lisp was the most effective tool for representing both symbolic expressions and manipulations of them it was also an object of study in itself lisp can readily operate on other lisp programs that are represented as list structures and it thus can be used for symbolic reasoning on programs lisp is also notable because it is based on ideas of mathematical logic that are of great importance in the study of computability and formal systems see chapter 8lisp was successful in niche commercial applications for instance lisp is the scripting language in autocad the widely used computeraided design cad program from autodesk but it had much broader implications for other languages effective implementation of lisp demanded some form of automatic memory management thus lisp had critical influence far beyond ai in the theory and design of programming languages including all functional programming languages as well as objectoriented languages such as simula67 smalltalk and most notably java this is not just a happy accident but rather a consequence of the conceptual breakthroughs arising from the effort to develop computational models of reasoning other examples include framebased knowledge representations which strongly influenced the development of objectoriented programming and object databases rulebased and logicprogramming language ideas which found practical applications in expert systems databases and optimization techniques and cad representations for reasoning with uncertainty which have found their way into manufacturing control medical and equipment diagnosis and humancomputer interfacesprincipia of bertrand russell and alfred north whitehead newell and simon 195612this program is regarded by many as the first successful ai program and the language it used ipl2 is recognized as the first significant listprocessing language as programmed by simon newell and shaw a computer simulated human intelligence solving a problem in logic inmuch the same way as would a skilled logician in this sense the machine demonstrated artificial intelligence the project was funded almost entirely by the air force through project rand and much of the computer programming was done at rand on an air forcefunded computer the johnniac named after rand consultant john von neumann the creator of the basic architecture for digital electronic computers13newells collaboration with simon took him to carnegie tech where in 1957 he completed the institutions first doctoral dissertation in ai information processing a new technique for the behavioral sciences its thrust was clearly driven by the agenda laid out by the architects of gsia as newell later stressed his work with simon and that of simons several other ai students at gsia reflected the larger agenda of gsia even though most of this work was funded by the air force and onr until the early 1960s all of this work concentrated on the formal modeling of decision making and problem solvingsimon and newell developed another wellknown ai program as a sequel to logic theorist—the general problem solver gps first run in 1957 and developed further in subsequent years their work on gps like that on logic theorist was characterized by its use of heuristics ie efficient but fallible rules of thumb as the means to simulate human cognitive processes newell et al 1959 the gps was capable of solving an array of problems that challenge human intelligence an important accomplishment in and of itself but most significantly it solved these problems by simulating the way a human being would solve them these overall research efforts at gsia including the doctoral research of simons students—all funded principally by air force and onr money—remained modest in scale compared to those at carnegie tech after 196214also modest were the efforts at mit where mccarthy and minsky established the artificial intelligence project in september 1957 this effort was funded principally through a wordofmouth agreement with jerome wiesner then director of mits militaryfunded research laboratory in electronics rle in exchange for a room two programmers a secretary and a keypunch machine the two assistant professors of mathematics agreed according to mccarthy to undertake the supervision of some of the six mathematics graduate students that rle had undertaken to support15the research efforts at carnegie tech which became carnegie mellon university cmu in 1967 rand and mit although limited yielded outstanding results in a short time simon and newell showed that computers could demonstrate humanlike behavior in certain welldefined tasks16 substantial progress was also made by mccarthy with his pioneering development of lisp and minsky who formalized heuristic processes and other means of reasoning including pattern recognitionpreviously computers had been used principally to crunch numbers and the tools for such tasks were primitive the ai researchers found ways to represent logical formulas carry out proofs conduct plans and manipulate such objects buoyed by their successes researchers at both institutions projected bold visions—which as the research was communicated to the public became magnified into excessive claims—about the future of the new field of ai and what computers might ultimately achieve17the establishment in 1962 of arpas information processing techniques office ipto radically changed the scale of research in ai propelling it from a collection of small projects into a largescale highprofile domain from the 1960s through the 1990s darpa provided the bulk of the nations support for ai research and thus helped to legitimize ai as an important field of inquiry and influence the scope of related research over time the nature of darpas support changed radically—from an emphasis on fundamental research at a limited number of centers of excellence to more broadbased support for applied research tied to military applications—both reflecting and motivating changes in the field of ai itselfthe early academic centers were mit and carnegie tech following john mccarthys move to stanford in 1963 to create the stanford artificial intelligence laboratory sail ipto worked a similar transformation of ai research at stanford by making it the third center of excellence in ai indeed the ipto increased stanfords allocation in 1965 allowing it to upgrade its computing capabilities and to launch five major team projects in ai research commenting in 1984 about how airelated research at carnegie tech migrated out of gsia into what became an autonomous department and later a college of cmu newell 1984 captured the transformation wrought by iptothe darpa support of ai and computer science is a remarkable story of the nurturing of a new scientific field not only with mit stanford and cmu which are now seen as the main darpasupported university computerscience research environments but with other universities as well darpa began to build excellence in information processing in whatever fashion we thought best the darpa effort or anything similar had not been in our wildest imaginingsanother center of excellence—the stanford research institutes sris artificial intelligence center—emerged a bit later in 1966 with charles rosen at the command it focused on developing automatons capable of gathering processing and transmitting information in a hostile environment nilsson 1984 soon sri committed itself to the development of an aidriven robot shakey as a means to achieve its objective shakeys development necessitated extensive basic research in several domains including planning naturallanguage processing and machine vision sris achievements in these areas eg the strips planning system and work in machine vision have endured but changes in the funders expectations for this research exposed sris ai program to substantial criticism in spite of these real achievementsunder jcr licklider ivan sutherland and robert taylor darpa continued to invest in ai research at cmu mit stanford and sri and to a lesser extent other institutions18 licklider 1964 asserted that ai was central to darpas mission because it was a key to the development of advanced commandandcontrol systems artificial intelligence was a broad category for licklider and his immediate successors who supported work in problem solving natural language processing pattern recognition heuristic programming automatic theorem proving graphics and intelligent automata various problems relating to humanmachine communication—tablets graphic systems handeye coordination—were all pursued with ipto support norberg and oneill 1996these categories were sufficiently broad that researchers like mccarthy minsky and newell could view their institutions research during the first 10 to 15 years of darpas ai funding as essentially unfettered by immediate applications moreover as work in one problem domain spilled over into others easily and naturally researchers could attack problems from multiple perspectives thus ai was ideally suited to graduate education and enrollments at each of the ai centers grew rapidly during the first decade of darpa fundingdarpas early support launched a golden age of ai research and rapidly advanced the emergence of a formal discipline much of darpas funding for ai was contained in larger program initiatives licklider considered ai a part of his general charter of computers command and control project mac see box 42 a project on timeshared computing at mit allocated roughly onethird of its 23 million annual budget to ai research with few specific objectivesthe history of speech recognition systems illustrates several themes common to ai research more generally the long time periods between the initial research and development of successful products and the interactions between ai researchers and the broader community of researchers in machine intelligence many capabilities of todays speechrecognition systems derive from the early work of statisticians electrical engineersinformation theorists and patternrecognition researchers another key theme is the complementary nature of government and industry funding industry supported work in speech recognition at least as far back as the 1950s when researchers at bell laboratories worked on systems for recognizing individual spoken digits zero through nine research in the area was boosted tremendously by darpa in the 1970sdarpa established the speech understanding research sur program to develop a computer system that could understand continuous speech lawrence roberts initiated this project in 1971 while he was director of ipto against the advice of a national academy of sciences committee19 roberts wanted a system that could handle a vocabulary of 10000 english words spoken by anyone his advisory board which included allen newell and jcr licklider issued a report calling for an objective of 1000 words spoken in a quiet room by a limited number of people using a restricted subject vocabulary newell et al 1971roberts committed 3 million per year for 5 years with the intention of pursuing a 5year followon project major sur project groups were established at cmu sri mits lincoln laboratory systems development corporation sdc and bolt beranek and newman bbn smaller contracts were awarded to a few other institutions five years later sur products were demonstrated cmu researchers demonstrated two systems harpy and hearsayi and bbn developed hear what i mean hwim the system developed cooperatively by sri and sdc was never tested green 1988 the system that came the closest to satisfying the original project goals—and may have exceeded the benchmarks—was harpy but controversy arose within darpa and the ai community about the way the tests were handled full details regarding the testing of system performance had not been worked out at the outset of the sur program20 as a result some researchers—including darpa research managers—believed that the sur program had failed to meet its objectives darpa terminated the program without funding the followon21 nevertheless industry groups including those at ibm continued to invest in this research area and made important contributions to the development of continuous speech recognition methods22darpa began funding speech recognition research on a large scale again in 1984 as part of the strategic computing program discussed later in this chapter and continued funding research in this area well into the late 1990s many of the same institutions that had been part of the sur program including cmu bbn sri and mit participated in the new initiatives firms such as ibm and dragon systems also participated as a result of the controversy over sur testing evaluation methods and criteria for these programs were carefully prescribed though mutual agreements between darpa managers and the funded researchers someresearchers have hailed this development and praised darpas role in benchmarking speechrecognition technology not only for research purposes but also for the commercial marketby holding annual system evaluations on carefully designed tasks and test materials darpa and the national bureau of standards later the national institute of standards and technology led the standardsdefinition process drawing the participation of not only government contractors but also industry and university groups from around the world such as att cambridge university of the united kingdom and limsi of france the overall effect was the rapid adoption of the most successful techniques by every participant and quick migration of those techniques into products and services although it resulted in quick diffusion of successful techniques this approach may also have narrowed the scope of approaches taken critics have seen this as symptomatic of a profound change in darpas philosophy that has reduced the emphasis on basic researchdarpas funding of research on understanding speech has been extremely important first it pushed the research frontiers of speech recognition and ai more generally hearsayii is particularly notable for the way it parsed information into independent knowledge sources which in turn interacted with each other through a common database that cmu researchers labeled a blackboard englemore et al 1988 this blackboard method of information processing proved to be a significant advance in ai moreover although early speechrecognition researchers appeared overly ambitious in incorporating syntax and semantics into their systems others have recently begun to adopt this approach to improve statistically based speechrecognition technologyperhaps more important the results of this research have been incorporated into the products of established companies such as ibm and bbn as well as startups such as nuance communications an sri spinoff and dragon systems microsoft corporation too is incorporating speech recognition technology into its operating system darpa 1997 mcclain 1998 the leading commercial speechrecognition program on the market today the dragon systems software traces its roots directly back to the work done at cmu between 1971 and 1975 as part of sur see box 92 the dragon program developed in cmus sur project the predecessor of the harpy program pioneered the use of techniques borrowed from mathematics and statistics hidden markov models to recognize continuous speech baker 1975 according to some scholars the adoption of hidden markov models by cmus research team owes much to activities outside the ai field such as research by engineers and statisticians with an interest in machine intelligence23other examples of commercial success abound charles schwab andbox 92 dragon systems profits from success in speech recognitiondragon systems was founded in 1982 by james and janet baker to commercialize speech recognition technology as graduate students at rockefeller university in 1970 they became interested in speech recognition while observing waveforms of speech on an oscilloscope at the time systems were in place for recognizing a few hundred words of discrete speech provided the system was trained on the speaker and the speaker paused between words there were not yet techniques that could sort through naturally spoken sentences james baker saw the waveforms—and the problem of natural speech recognition—as an interesting patternrecognition problemrockefeller had neither experts in speech understanding nor suitable computing power and so the bakers moved to carnegie mellon university cmu a prime contractor for darpas speech understanding research program there they began to work on natural speech recognition capabilities their approach differed from that of other speech researchers most of whom were attempting to recognize spoken language by providing contextual information such as the speakers identity what the speaker knew and what the speaker might be trying to say in addition to rules of english the bakers approach was based purely on statistical relationships such as the probability that any two or three words would appear one after another in spoken english they created a phonetic dictionary with the sounds of different word groups and then set to work on an algorithm to decipher a string of spoken words based on phonetic sound matches and the probability that someone would speak the words in that order their approach soon began outperforming competing systemsafter receiving their doctorates from cmu in 1975 the bakers joined ibms tj watson research center one of the only organizations at the time working on largevocabulary continuous speech recognition the bakers developed a program that could recognize speech from a 1000word vocabulary but it could not do so in real time running on an ibm system 370 computer it took roughly an hour to decode a single spoken sentence nevertheless the bakers grew impatient with what they saw as ibms reluctance to develop simpler systems that could be more rapidly put to commercial use they left in 1979 to join verbex voice systems a subsidiary of exxon enterprises that had built a system for collecting data over the telephone using spoken digits less than 3 years later however exxon exited the speech recognition businesswith few alternatives the bakers decided to start their own company dragon systems the company survived its early years through a mix of custom projects government research contracts and new products that relied on the more mature discrete speech recognition technology in 1984 they provided apricot computer a british company with the first speech recognition capability for a personal computer pc it allowed users to open files and run programs using spoken commands but apricot folded shortly thereafter in 1986 dragon systems was awarded the first of a series of contracts from darpa to advance largevocabulary speakerindependent continuous speech recognition and by 1988 dragon conducted the first public demonstration of a pcbased discrete speech recognition system boasting an 8000word vocabularyin 1990 dragon demonstrated a 5000word continuous speech system for pcs and introduced dragon dictate 30k the first largevocabulary speechtotext systemfor generalpurpose dictation it allowed control of a pc using voice commands only and found acceptance among the disabled the system had limited appeal in the broader marketplace because it required users to pause between words other federal contracts enabled dragon to improve its technology in 1991 dragon received a contract from darpa for work on machineassisted translation systems and in 1993 dragon received a federal technology reinvestment project award to develop in collaboration with analog devices corporation continuous speech recognition systems for desktop and handheld personal digital assistants pdas dragon demonstrated pda speech recognition in the apple newton messagepad 2000 in 1997late in 1993 the bakers realized that improvements in desktop computers would soon allow continuous voice recognition they quickly began setting up a new development team to build such a product to finance the needed expansion of its engineering marketing and sales staff dragon brokered a deal whereby seagate technologies bought 25 percent of dragons stock by july 1997 dragon had launched dragon naturally speaking a continuous speech recognition program for generalpurpose use with a vocabulary of 23000 words the package won rave reviews and numerous awards ibm quickly followed suit offering its own continuous speech recognition program viavoice in august after a crash development program by the end of the year the two companies combined had sold more than 75000 copies of their software other companies such as microsoft corporation and lucent technologies are expected to introduce products in the near future and analysts expect a 4 billion worldwide market by 2001source the primary source for this history is garfinkel 1998 a corporate history is available on the companys web site at httpwwwdragonsyscomcompany adopted darpa technology to develop its voice broker system which provides stock quotes over the telephone the system can recognize the names of 13000 different securities as well as major regional us accents on the military side darpa provided translingual communication devices for use in bosnia these devices translated spoken english phrases into corresponding serbocroatian or russian phrases the total market for these new personaluse voice recognition technologies is expected to reach about 4 billion in 2001 garfinkel 1998although most founders of the ai field continued to pursue basic questions of human and machine intelligence some of their students and other secondgeneration researchers began to seek ways to use ai methods and approaches to tackle realworld problems their initiatives were important not only in their own right but also because they were indicative of a gradual but significant change in the funding environment toward more applied realms of research the development fo expert systems such as dendral at sail provides but one example of this trend see box 93box 93 pioneering expert systemsthe dendral project was initiated in 1965 by edward feigenbaum one of herbert simons doctoral students in ai nobel prizewinning geneticist and biochemist joshua lederberg and bruce buchanan a recent recipient of a doctorate in philosophy from michigan state university1 dendral began as an effort to explore the mechanization of scientific reasoning and the formalization of scientific knowledge by working within a specific domain of science organic chemistry developed in part with an initial research grant from the national aeronautics and space administration in anticipation of landing unmanned spacecraft on other planets but also picked up under darpa funding dendral used a set of knowledgeor rulebased reasoning commands to deduce the likely molecular structure of organic chemical compounds from known chemical analyses and mass spectrometry data the program took almost 10 years to develop combining the talents of chemists geneticists and computer scientists in addition to rivaling the skill of expert organic chemists in predicting the structures of molecules in certain classes of compounds dendral proved to be fundamentally important in demonstrating how rulebased reasoning could be developed into powerful knowledge engineering tools its use resulted in a number of papers published in the chemistry literature although it is no longer a topic of academic research the most recent version of the interactive structure generator genoa has been licensed by stanford university for commercial usedendral led to the development of other rulebased reasoning programs at the stanford artificial intelligence laboratory sail the most important of which was mycin which helped physicians diagnose a range of infectious blood diseases based on sets of clinical symptoms2 begun in 1972 and completed in 1980 the mycin project went further than dendral in that it kept the rules or embodied knowledge separate from the inference engine that applied the rules this latter part of the mycin project was essentially the first expertsystem shell buchanan and shortliffe 19843the development of these pioneering expert systems not only constituted major achievements in ai but also gave both researchers and research funders a glimpse of the ultimate power of computers as a tool for reasoning and decision making moreover the apparent success of these projects helped to touch off the rapid development of expert systems promoted by sails edward feignbaum expert systems became the rage in ai research in the late 1970s and early 1980s and a commercial tool in the 1980s when corporations were seeking to embody the knowledge of theirskilled employees who were facing either retirement or downsizing feigenbaum et al 1988 expertsystem shells based in large part on the empty mycin emycin shell moved on to the commercial software marketstarting in the mid1980s numerous startup ai companies began to appear many with products akin to expert systems many such companies came and went but some flourished for example gensym corporation founded in 1986 by an alumnus of the massachusetts institute of technologys artificial intelligence laboratory built a substantial business based on its g2 product for development of intelligent systems more recently trilogy development group inc went public selling both software and services that apply rulebased reasoning and other ai methods to marketing operations one of trilogys founders a stanford university graduate learned about the expert system that carnegie mellon university cmu had developed for digital equipment corporation to configure its vax computers xcon4 basing their work in part on the systems that had emerged from dendral and mycin and what they learned about xcon trilogys founders also used constraintbased equations and objectoriented programming methods derived in part from ai research5 another of trilogys founders applied the companys methods to the marketing of personal computers pcs over the internet this new firm pcordercominc promises to simplify the configuration of pcs and drastically lower the cost of buying or selling one mchugh 1996many corporations committed substantial capital and human resources to the development of expert systems and many reported substantial returns on these investments others found that as ai pioneer mccarthy 1990 had argued these expert systems were extremely brittle in that a small development in knowledge or change in practice rendered such programs obsolete or too narrow to use in one study of ai office of technology assessment 1985 expert systems were singled out as evidence of the first real commercial products of about 25 years of ai research but were also criticized for several serious weaknesses that demanded fundamental breakthroughs to overcome but expert systems represented a failure to meet expectations as much as a failure of technology they provided valuable help for users who understand the limitations of a system that embodied narrow domains of knowledge one of the biggest problems with expert systems was the term itself which implied a certain level of capability a number of users started calling them knowledgebased systems to refer to the technology instead of the goaldespite these criticisms work on expert systems continues to be published some corporations with strong knowledgeengineering capabilities continue to report substantial savings from expert systems and have demonstrated a continued commitment to expanding their use expertsystem shell programs continue to be developed improved and sold by 1992 some 11 shell programs were available for the macintosh platform 29 for ibmdos platforms 4 for unix platforms and 12 for dedicated mainframe applications6 a recent review of expert systems reported that the north american market for expert systems is roughly 250 million representing about 70 percent of the total commercial ai market estimates suggest that more than 12000 standalone expert systems are in use liebowitz 1997 moreover small expert systems are being incorporated into other types of computer software most of it proprietary1the literature on dendral is extensive for the most recent participants account see lindsay et al 19932another important program carried out in the early 1970s was metadendral this inductive program automatically formulates new rules for dendral to use in explaining data about unknown chemical compounds using the plangeneratetest paradigm metadendral has successfully formulated rules of mass spectrometry both by rediscovering existing rules and by proposing entirely new rules although metadendral is no longer an active program its contributions to ideas about learning and discovery are being applied to new domains these ideas suggest for example that induction can be automated as a heuristic search that for efficiency search can be broken into two steps—approximate and refined that learning must be able to cope with noisy and incomplete data and that learning multiple concepts at the same time is sometimes inescapable more information is available online at httpwwwcamisstanfordeduresearchhistorythmldendral3the mycin team also developed an important program known as teiresias which made the basis of mycins reasoning transparent to its users and allowed mycins knowledge base to be changed or upgraded more easily the literature on these programs is extensive4xcon for expert configurer has been widely hailed as one of the first successful expert systems programs it was the work of john mcdermott and his team at cmu see crevier 19945trilogys history is discussed by mchugh 19966these data were compiled from rr bowker company 1992 and table 3 in pickett and case 1991the promotion in 1969 of lawrence roberts to director of ipto also contributed to a perceived tightening of ai research under roberts ipto developed a formal ai program which in turn was divided into formal subprograms norberg and oneill 1996 the lineitem budget of ai research inevitably led to greater scrutiny owing to reporting mechanisms and the need to justify programs to the dod the administration and the us congress consequently researchers began to believe that they were being boxed in by ipto and darpa and to a certain extent they were the flow of darpas ai research money to cmu mit and stanford university did not cease or even diminish much but the demand grew for interim reports and more tangible resultsexternal developments reinforced this shift the most important was the passage of the mansfield amendment in 196924 passed during the vietnam war amid growing public concern about the militaryindustrial complex and the domination of us academic science by the military the mansfield amendment restricted the dod to supporting basic research that was of direct and apparent utility to specific military functions and operations it brought about a swift decline in some of the militarys support for basic research often driving it toward the applied realm25 roberts and his successors now had to justify ai research programs on the basis of immediate utility to the military mission the move toward relevance spawned dissatisfaction among both the established pioneers of the ai field and its outside skeptics26another external development provided further impetus for change in 1973 at the request of the british scientific research council sir james lighthill the lucasian professor of applied mathematics at cambridge university and a fellow of the royal society of london produced a survey that expressed considerable skepticism about ai in general and research domains in particular despite having no expertise in ai himself lighthill suggested that any particular successes in ai had stemmed from modeling efforts in more traditional disciplines not from ai per se he singled out robotics research for especially sharp criticism the lighthill report raised questions about ai research funding in the united states and led dod to establish a panel to assess darpas ai programknown as the american study group the panel which included some of ais major research figures raised some of the same questions as did lighthills report and served to inform george heilmeier a former research manager from rca corporation who was then assistant director of defense rd and later became director of darpa the lighthill report and its us equivalent led to a shifting of darpa funds out of robotics research hurting institutions such as sri that had committed heavily to the area and toward missionoriented direct research rather than basic undirected research fleck 198227as a result of these forces darpas emphasis on relevance in ai research grew during the late 1970s and 1980s despite the disgruntlement among some scientists the changes led to increased funding—although not directly to widespread commercial success—for ai research a magnet for these monies was the strategic computing program scp announced in 1983 darpa 1983 darpa committed 1 billion over the planned 10year course of the program the four main goals of the scp were as followsto achieve these goals darpa established three specific applications as rd objectives a pilots associate for the air force an autonomous land vehicle for the army and an aircraft battle management system for the navy the applications were intended to spark the military services interest in developing ai technology based on fundamental research the scp differed from some other largescale national efforts in that its goals were extremely ambitious requiring fundamental advances in the underlying technology by contrast efforts such as the apollo space program were principally engineering projects drawing from an established scientific base office of technology assessment 1985 the scp also differed from earlier large ai programs in that some 60 percent of its funds were committed to industry however of the 30 prime contractors for the scp involved in software or ai research more than 20 were established defense contractors goldstein 1992the scp significantly boosted overall federal funding for ai research but also altered its character between 1984 and 1988 total federal funding for ai research excluding the scp tripled from 57 million to 159 million see table 91 with support for the scp included federal funding increased from 106 million to 274 million because the scp was budgeted as an applied program it tipped the balance of federal funding toward applied research although darpas funding for basic ai research doubled from roughly 20 million to 40 million during this same period the dods overall role in basic ai research declined see table 92 meanwhile it continued to play the dominant role in supporting applied research in ai see table 93 although budget categorizations for programs such as the scp are somewhat arbitrary and subject to political influence researchers noted a change in darpas funding stylethe scp also attracted a tremendous amount of industry investment and venture capital to ai research and development firms developing and selling expert systems entered the market often basing their systems on the lisp machines developed by the ai community several new firms entered the market to design make and sell the very expensive lisp machines yet the rapid development of engineering workstations especially those of sun microsystems inc soon undermined the lisp machine industry this segment of the market which was clearly tied totable 91 total federal funding for artificial intelligence research in millions of dollars 1984198819841985198619871988excluding strategic

expertsystem shells to run on lesscostly machines doubts began to arise about the capabilities and flexibility of expert systems this doubt hampered the commercialization of ai in addition commercial contractors had difficulty meeting the highprofile milestones of the major scp projects because of difficulties with either the ai technologies themselves or their incorporation into larger systems such problems undermined the emergence of a clearly identifiable ai industry and contributed to a shift in emphasis in highperformance computing away from ai and toward other grand challenges such as weather modeling and prediction and scientific visualizationdespite the commercial difficulties associated with the strategic computing program the aidriven advances in rulebased reasoning systems ie expert systems and their successors—many of which were initiated with darpa funding in the 1960s and 1970s—proved to be extremely valuable for the emerging national information infrastructure and electronic commerce these advances including probabilistic reasoning systems and bayesian networks natural language processing and knowledge representation brought ai out of the laboratory and into the marketplace paradoxically the major commercial successes of ai research applications are mostly hidden from view today because they are embedded in larger software systems none of these systems has demonstrated general human intelligence but many have contributed to commercial and military objectivesan example is the lumiere project initiated at microsoft research in 1993 lumiere monitors a computer users actions to determine when assistance may be needed it continuously follows the users goals and tasks as software programs run using bayesian networks to generate a probability distribution over topic areas that might pose difficulties and calculating the probability that the user will not mind being bothered with assistance lumiere forms the basis of the office assistant that monitors the behavior of users of microsofts office 97 and assists them with applications lumiere is based on earlier work on probabilistic models of user goals to support the display of customized information to pilots of commercial aircraft as well as user modeling for display control for flight engineers at nasas mission control center these earlier projects sponsored by the nasaames research center and nasas johnson space center were undertaken while some of the lumiere researchers were students at stanford university28patent trends suggest that ai technology is being incorporated into growing numbers of commercial products the number of patents in aiexpert systems and neural networks jumped from fewer than 20 in 1988 to more than 120 in 1996 and the number of patents citing patents in these areas grew from about 140 to almost 80029 the number of airelated patents including patents in ai expert systems neural networks intelligent systems adaptive agents and adaptive systems issued annually in the united states increased exponentially from approximately 100 in 1985 to more than 900 in 1996 see figure 91 changes in the us patent and trademark offices rules on the patentability of algorithms have no doubt contributed to this growth as has the increased commercial value of ai technology the vast majority of these patents are held by private firms including large manufacturers of electronics and computers as well as major users of information technology see table 94 these data indicate that ai technology is likely to be embedded in larger systems from computers to cars to manufacturing lines rather than used as standalone productsa central problem confronting the wider commercialization of ai today revolves around integration both the software and the hardware developed by the ai research community were so advanced that their integration into older more conservative computer and organizationalfigure 91artificialintelligencerelated

proved to be an enormous challenge as one observer has noted because ai was a leadingedge technology it arrived in this world too early as a consequence the ai application community had to ride many waves of technological quick fixes and fads many of these integration problems are now being addressed head on by a broad community of information technologists using internetbased frameworks such as corba common object request broker architecture and the world wide web shrobe 1996the rapid development of computer hardware and software the networking of information systems and the need to make these systems function smoothly and intelligently are leading to wide diffusion of ai knowledge and technology across the infrastructure of the information age federal funding reflects these changes see box 94 meanwhile much of the knowledge acquired through ai research over the years isnow being brought to bear on realworld problems and applications while also being deepened and broadened the economic and social benefits are enormous technologies such as expert systems naturallanguage processing and computer vision are now used in a range of applications such as decision aids planning tools speechrecognition systems pattern recognition knowledge representation and computercontrolled robots30box 94 darpas current artificial intelligence programat darpa funding for al research is spread among a number of program areas each with a specific application focus for example funding for al is included in the intelligent systems and software program which received roughly 60 million in 1995 this applied research program is intended to leverage work in intelligent systems and software that supports military objectives enabling information systems to assist in decisionmaking tasks in stressful timesensitive situations areas of emphasis include intelligent systems software development technology and manufacturing automation and design engineering intelligent systems encompass autonomous systems interactive problem solving and intelligent integration of information1additional darpa funding for al is contained in the intelligent integration of information 13 program which is intended to improve commanders awareness of battlefield conditions by developing and demonstrating technology that integrates data from heterogeneous sources specific goals include a 100fold reduction in the time needed to retrieve information from large dynamically changing databases as well as the development demonstration and transition to the services of tools that will reduce the time needed to develop maintain and evolve largescale integrated data systems2 the program supports basic computer sciences specifically in al relevant to integration technology development prototyping demonstrations and early phases of technology transferdarpa continues to fund some basic research in al as well such funding is included in its information sciences budget which declined from 35 million to 22 million annually between 1991 and 1996 the al funding supports work in software technology development humancomputer interfaces microelectronics and speech recognition and understanding in addition to intelligent systems the work on intelligent systems focuses on advanced techniques for knowledge representation reasoning and machine learning which enable computer understanding of spoken and written language and images also included are advanced methods for planning scheduling and resource allocation1this definition was obtained from the fy 97 implementation plan on the web site of the national science and technology councils committee on computing information and communications at httpwwwccicgovpubsimp9714html2this information was obtained from the project description intelligent integration of information on darpas web site at httpwebext2darpamilisoi3aboutmainhtmlai technologies help industry diagnose machine failures design new products and plan simulate and schedule production they help scientists search large databases and decode dna sequences and they help doctors make moreinformed decisions about diagnosis and treatment of particular ailments ai technologies also make the larger systems into which they are incorporated easier to use and more productive these benefits are relatively easy to identify but measuring them is difficultfederal investments in ai have produced a number of notable results some envisioned by the founders of the field and others probably not even imagined without question darpas generous enduring funding of various aspects of ai research created a scientific research discipline that meets the standard criteria of discipline formation laid out by sociologists of science31 at least three major academic centers of excellence and several other significant centers were established and they produced a large number of graduates with phds who diffused ai research to other research universities crosspollinated the major research centers and moved ai methods into commercial markets figure 92 shows the production of phd degrees in ai and related fields at us universitiesfigure 92phd dissertations submitted annually in artificial intelligence and related fields 19561995source data from dissertation abstracts online which is available through subscription to the oclc first search

available through subscription to the oclc first search database from umi companyfigure 93 compares phd production in ai and related disciplines to degree production in computer science more broadly in sum the returns on the public investment are clearly enormous both in matters of national security which are beyond the scope of this study32 and in contributions to the us economyas this case study demonstrates federal funding is critical in establishing new disciplines because it can sustain longterm highrisk research areas and nurture a critical mass of technical and human resources darpa helped legitimize the ai field and served as the major source of research funds beginning in the 1960s it created centers of excellence that evolved into todays major computer science research centers this support was particularly critical given that some objectives took much longer to realize than was originally anticipateda diversity of approaches to research problems can be critical to the development of practical tools a prime example is the field of speech recognition in which the most effective products to date have used techniques borrowed from the mathematics and statistics communities rather than more traditional ai techniques this outcome could not have been predicted and demonstrates the importance of supporting competing approaches even those outside the mainstreamfederal funding has promoted innovation in commercial products such as expert systems the establishment of new companies the growth of billiondollar markets for technologies such as speech recognition and the development of valuable military applications ai technologies often enhance the performance of the larger systems into which they are increasingly incorporatedthere is a creative tension between fundamental research and attempts to create functional devices original attempts to design intelligent thinking machines motivated fundamental work that created a base of knowledge initial advances achieved through research were not sufficient to produce by themselves commercial products but they could be integrated with other components and exploited in different applications efforts to apply ai technology often failed initally because they uncovered technical problems that had not yet been adequately addressed applications were fed back into the research process thus motivating inquiries into new areas1several histories of ai research have appeared over the last 25 years some written by members of the ai community some published by those outside the field and still others produced by science journalists these histories have been based largely on the published scientific literature journalistic accounts of work in the field published accounts of participants in the field and interviews with participants with some notable exceptions few of these histories have relied on original source materials such as manuscript records of participants or

participants account see lindsay et al 1993 2 another important program carried out in the early 1970s was metadendral this inductive program automatically formulates new rules for dendral to use in explaining data about unknown chemical compounds using the plangeneratetest paradigm metadendral has successfully formulated rules of mass spectrometry both by rediscovering existing rules and by proposing entirely new rules although metadendral is no longer an active program its contributions to ideas about learning and discovery are being applied to new domains these ideas suggest for example that induction can be automated as a heuristic search that for efficiency search can be broken into two steps—approximate and refined that learning must be able to cope with noisy and incomplete data and that learning multiple concepts at the same time is sometimes inescapable more information is available online at httpwwwcamisstanfordeduresearchhistorythmldendral 3 the mycin team

91 the development and influence of lisp lisp has been an important programming language in ai research and its history demonstrates the more general benefits resulting from the efforts of ai researchers to tackle exceptionally difficult problems as with other developments in ai lisp demonstrates how in addressing problems in the representation and computational treatment of knowledge ai researchers often stretched the limits of computing technology and were forced to invent new techniques that found their way into mainstream application early ai researchers interested in logical reasoning and problem solving needed tools to represent logical formulas proofs plans and computations on such objects existing programming techniques were very awkward for this purpose inspiring the development of specialized programming languages such as listprocessing languages list structures provide a simple and universal encoding of the expressions that arise in symbolic logic formal language theory and their applications to the formalization of reasoning and natural language understanding among early listprocessing languages the name is based on that phrase lisp was the most effective tool for representing both symbolic expressions and manipulations of them it was also an object of study in itself lisp can readily operate on other lisp programs that are represented as list structures and it thus can be used for symbolic reasoning on programs lisp is also notable because it is based on ideas of mathematical logic that are of great importance in the study of computability and formal systems see chapter 8 lisp was successful in niche commercial applications for instance lisp is the scripting language in autocad the widely used computeraided design cad program from autodesk but it had much broader implications for other languages effective implementation of lisp demanded some form of automatic memory management thus lisp had critical influence far beyond ai in the theory and design of programming languages including all functional programming languages as well as objectoriented languages such as simula67 smalltalk and most notably java this is not just a happy accident but rather a consequence of the conceptual breakthroughs arising from the effort to develop computational models of reasoning other examples include framebased knowledge representations which strongly influenced the development of objectoriented programming and object databases rulebased and logicprogramming language ideas which found practical applications in expert systems databases and optimization techniques and cad representations for reasoning with uncertainty which have found their way into manufacturing control medical and equipment diagnosis and humancomputer interfacesbox 92 dragon systems profits from success in speech recognition dragon systems was founded in 1982 by james and janet baker to commercialize speech recognition technology as graduate students at rockefeller university in 1970 they became interested in speech recognition while observing waveforms of speech on an oscilloscope at the time systems were in place for recognizing a few hundred words of discrete speech provided the system was trained on the speaker and the speaker paused between words there were not yet techniques that could sort through naturally spoken sentences james baker saw the waveforms—and the problem of natural speech recognition—as an interesting patternrecognition problem rockefeller had neither experts in speech understanding nor suitable computing power and so the bakers moved to carnegie mellon university cmu a prime contractor for darpas speech understanding research program there they began to work on natural speech recognition capabilities their approach differed from that of other speech researchers most of whom were attempting to recognize spoken language by providing contextual information such as the speakers identity what the speaker knew and what the speaker might be trying to say in addition to rules of english the bakers approach was based purely on statistical relationships such as the probability that any two or three words would appear one after another in spoken english they created a phonetic dictionary with the sounds of different word groups and then set to work on an algorithm to decipher a string of spoken words based on phonetic sound matches and the probability that someone would speak the words in that order their approach soon began outperforming competing systems after receiving their doctorates from cmu in 1975 the bakers joined ibms tj watson research center one of the only organizations at the time working on largevocabulary continuous speech recognition the bakers developed a program that could recognize speech from a 1000word vocabulary but it could not do so in real time running on an ibm system 370 computer it took roughly an hour to decode a single spoken sentence nevertheless the bakers grew impatient with what they saw as ibms reluctance to develop simpler systems that could be more rapidly put to commercial use they left in 1979 to join verbex voice systems a subsidiary of exxon enterprises that had built a system for collecting data over the telephone using spoken digits less than 3 years later however exxon exited the speech recognition business with few alternatives the bakers decided to start their own company dragon systems the company survived its early years through a mix of custom projects government research contracts and new products that relied on the more mature discrete speech recognition technology in 1984 they provided apricot computer a british company with the first speech recognition capability for a personal computer pc it allowed users to open files and run programs using spoken commands but apricot folded shortly thereafter in 1986 dragon systems was awarded the first of a series of contracts from darpa to advance largevocabulary speakerindependent continuous speech recognition and by 1988 dragon conducted the first public demonstration of a pcbased discrete speech recognition system boasting an 8000word vocabulary in 1990 dragon demonstrated a 5000word continuous speech system for pcs and introduced dragon dictate 30k the first largevocabulary speechtotext systemfor generalpurpose dictation it allowed control of a pc using voice commands only and found acceptance among the disabled the system had limited appeal in the broader marketplace because it required users to pause between words other federal contracts enabled dragon to improve its technology in 1991 dragon received a contract from darpa for work on machineassisted translation systems and in 1993 dragon received a federal technology reinvestment project award to develop in collaboration with analog devices corporation continuous speech recognition systems for desktop and handheld personal digital assistants pdas dragon demonstrated pda speech recognition in the apple newton messagepad 2000 in 1997 late in 1993 the bakers realized that improvements in desktop computers would soon allow continuous voice recognition they quickly began setting up a new development team to build such a product to finance the needed expansion of its engineering marketing and sales staff dragon brokered a deal whereby seagate technologies bought 25 percent of dragons stock by july 1997 dragon had launched dragon naturally speaking a continuous speech recognition program for generalpurpose use with a vocabulary of 23000 words the package won rave reviews and numerous awards ibm quickly followed suit offering its own continuous speech recognition program viavoice in august after a crash development program by the end of the year the two companies combined had sold more than 75000 copies of their software other companies such as microsoft corporation and lucent technologies are expected to introduce products in the near future and analysts expect a 4 billion worldwide market by 2001 source the primary source for this history is garfinkel 1998 a corporate history is available on the

geneticist and biochemist joshua lederberg and bruce buchanan a recent recipient of a doctorate in philosophy from michigan state university1 dendral began as an effort to explore the mechanization of scientific reasoning and the formalization of scientific knowledge by working within a specific domain of science organic chemistry developed in part with an initial research grant from the national aeronautics and space administration in anticipation of landing unmanned spacecraft on other planets but also picked up under darpa funding dendral used a set of knowledgeor rulebased reasoning commands to deduce the likely molecular structure of organic chemical compounds from known chemical analyses and mass spectrometry data the program took almost 10 years to develop combining the talents of chemists geneticists and computer scientists in addition to rivaling the skill of expert organic chemists in predicting the structures of molecules in certain classes of compounds dendral proved to be fundamentally important in demonstrating how rulebased reasoning could be developed into powerful knowledge engineering tools its use resulted in a number of papers published in the chemistry literature although it is no longer a topic of academic research the most recent version of the interactive structure generator genoa has been licensed by stanford university for commercial use dendral led to the development of other rulebased reasoning programs at the stanford artificial intelligence laboratory sail the most important of which was mycin which helped physicians diagnose a range of infectious blood diseases based on sets of clinical symptoms2 begun in 1972 and completed in 1980 the mycin project went further than dendral in that it kept the rules or embodied knowledge separate from the inference engine that applied the rules this latter part of the mycin project was essentially the first expertsystem shell buchanan and shortliffe 19843 the development of these pioneering expert systems not only constituted major achievements in ai but also gave both researchers and research funders a glimpse of the ultimate power of computers as a tool for reasoning and decision making moreover the apparent success of these projects helped to touch off the rapid development of expert systems promoted by sails edward feignbaum expert systems became the rage in ai research in the late 1970s and early 1980s and a commercial tool in the 1980s when corporations were seeking to embody the knowledge of theirskilled employees who were facing either retirement or downsizing feigenbaum et al 1988 expertsystem shells based in large part on the empty mycin emycin shell moved on to the commercial software market starting in the mid1980s numerous startup ai companies began to appear many with products akin to expert systems many such companies came and went but some flourished for example gensym corporation founded in 1986 by an alumnus of the massachusetts institute of technologys artificial intelligence laboratory built a substantial business based on its g2 product for development of intelligent systems more recently trilogy development group inc went public selling both software and services that apply rulebased reasoning and other ai methods to marketing operations one of trilogys founders a stanford university graduate learned about the expert system that carnegie mellon university cmu had developed for digital equipment corporation to configure its vax computers xcon4 basing their work in part on the systems that had emerged from dendral and mycin and what they learned about xcon trilogys founders also used constraintbased equations and objectoriented programming methods derived in part from ai research5 another of trilogys founders applied the companys methods to the marketing of personal computers pcs over the internet this new firm pcordercominc promises to simplify the configuration of pcs and drastically lower the cost of buying or selling one mchugh 1996 many corporations committed substantial capital and human resources to the development of expert systems and many reported substantial returns on these investments others found that as ai pioneer mccarthy 1990 had argued these expert systems were extremely brittle in that a small development in knowledge or change in practice rendered such programs obsolete or too narrow to use in one study of ai office of technology assessment 1985 expert systems were singled out as evidence of the first real commercial products of about 25 years of ai research but were also criticized for several serious weaknesses that demanded fundamental breakthroughs to overcome but expert systems represented a failure to meet expectations as much as a failure of technology they provided valuable help for users who understand the limitations of a system that embodied narrow domains of knowledge one of the biggest problems with expert systems was the term itself which implied a certain level of capability a number of users started calling them knowledgebased systems to refer to the technology instead of the goal despite these criticisms work on expert systems continues to be published some corporations with strong knowledgeengineering capabilities continue to report substantial savings from expert systems and have demonstrated a continued commitment to expanding their use expertsystem shell programs continue to be developed improved and sold by 1992 some 11 shell programs were available for the macintosh platform 29 for ibmdos platforms 4 for unix platforms and 12 for dedicated mainframe applications6 a recent review of expert systems reported that the north american market for expert systems is roughly 250 million representing about 70 percent of the total commercial ai market estimates suggest that more than 12000 standalone expert systems are in use liebowitz 1997 moreover small expert systems are being incorporated into other types of computer software most of it proprietary1 the literature on dendral is extensive for the most recent participants account see lindsay et al 1993 2 another important program carried out in the early 1970s was metadendral this inductive program automatically formulates new rules for dendral to use in explaining data about unknown chemical compounds using the plangeneratetest paradigm metadendral has successfully formulated rules of mass spectrometry both by rediscovering existing rules and by proposing entirely new rules although metadendral is no longer an active program its contributions to ideas about learning and discovery are being applied to new domains these ideas suggest for example that induction can be automated as a heuristic search that for efficiency search can be broken into two steps—approximate and refined that learning must be able to cope with noisy and incomplete data and that learning multiple concepts at the same time is sometimes inescapable more information is available online at httpwwwcamisstanfordeduresearchhistorythmldendral 3 the mycin team also developed an important program known as teiresias which made the basis of mycins reasoning transparent to its users and allowed mycins knowledge base to be changed or upgraded more easily the literature on these programs is extensive 4 xcon for expert configurer

application focus for example funding for al is included in the intelligent systems and software program which received roughly 60 million in 1995 this applied research program is intended to leverage work in intelligent systems and software that supports military objectives enabling information systems to assist in decisionmaking tasks in stressful timesensitive situations areas of emphasis include intelligent systems software development technology and manufacturing automation and design engineering intelligent systems encompass autonomous systems interactive problem solving and intelligent integration of information1 additional darpa funding for al is contained in the intelligent integration of information 13 program which is intended to improve commanders awareness of battlefield conditions by developing and demonstrating technology that integrates data from heterogeneous sources specific goals include a 100fold reduction in the time needed to retrieve information from large dynamically changing databases as well as the development demonstration and transition to the services of tools that will reduce the time needed to develop maintain and evolve largescale integrated data systems2 the program supports basic computer sciences specifically in al relevant to integration technology development prototyping demonstrations and early phases of technology transfer darpa continues to fund some basic research in al as well such funding is included in its information sciences budget which declined from 35 million to 22 million annually between 1991 and 1996 the al funding supports work in software technology development humancomputer interfaces microelectronics and speech recognition and understanding in addition to intelligent systems the work on intelligent systems focuses on advanced techniques for knowledge representation reasoning and machine learning which enable computer understanding of spoken and written language and images also included are advanced methods for planning scheduling and resource allocation 1 this definition was obtained from the fy 97 implementation plan on the web site of the national science and technology

intelligence into our daily lives we are now living in the era that we used to watch in scifi movies all the mesmerising inventions in those movies are “given” now and it is getting harder to blow our minds when the selfdriving and talking dream car of our childhoods “kitt in knight rider” is just a “car” and those futuristic video calls in “back to the future” became just ordinary daily calls for uswell we might not be “wowed” that easily nowadays however the future of artificial intelligence is looking quite interesting for 2018 and the near future with the attempts to apply reinforcement learning to problems which enables machines to model human psychology in order to make better predictions or contesting neural networks with generative adversarial networks algorithms which requires less human supervision and enables computers to learn from unlabeled data making them more intelligentlet’s leave the details to artificial intelligence scientists and take a look at the most exciting developments in various fields that we will benefit from in the near futureprobably one of the most researched and studied areas in artificial intelligence is healthcare – as it is a matter of life and death a very important application of big data and ai technology to the healthcare industry that has started to be a new trend is the area of “personalised medicine” or “precision medicine” since medicines and treatments are tailored for large populations and statistical data the current efforts focus on identifying symptoms however with this new approach which is based on data patient medical history present outbreaks environmental determinants clinical studies etc machine learning algorithms and precision molecular tools it is now possible to understand mechanisms of disease and match up individual problems with personalised treatments precision medicine initiative project created in 2015 by usa government states their shortterm goal is to expand cancer genomics to develop better prevention and treatment methods within a year they aim to build a comprehensive scientific knowledge base by creating a network of scientists and initiating a national cohort study of one million americans to expand their understanding of health and diseaseadvanced healthcare technology has already provided us sensory abilities such as better vision and hearing and with the entrance of ai now we have intelligent prosthetics for manipulation since the firstever integrated lower limb that behaves like a human leg has been created in 2016 it was milestone of next generation of prosthetics with its ai platform in fact this year a bionic hand which knows what it’s grabbing with an aipowered camera has been developed since the system and the ai software that recognises objects are cheap within one year we will see more sensors implemented to prosthetics in order for them to detect things like pressure or temperature another step closer to organic limbs future systems will also be able to communicate with our brains which will significantly reduce the limitations that amputees deal with and they will make life easier for elderly people or maybe create cyborgsthe last important ai application in the healthcare industry is robot assistants for many patients or elderly people ai is at a stage where replacing robots instead of people is getting more common robots help people with daily activities making sure they take their medications or notify someone when they don’t get out of bed etc in fact a japanese company has made the first big step toward a robot companion “pepper” in 2014 which is able to understand human emotions in addition to developing its own pepper went on sale in 2015 sold out within a minute in 2016 it was put on the market in different countries and started working at belgium hospitals by the end of this year they are planned to be placed at more hospitals and homes as healthcare assistantsimageartificial intelligence and its subsets machinedeep learning are recently the hottest trends in the finance industryai and machine learning techniques are being used in realtime data processing in contract compliance and regulation intelligence risk management trade monitoring and intelligent cash management where millions of unstructured and fluctuant data can be processed and analysed simultaneously– leaving no room for human errors when this is the case big data management is not a big concern anymore therefore predictions show us that in 2018 finance organisations will focus more on collecting and analysing more data across cultures and geographics such as customer behaviours location sociodemographics spending patterns and earnings etc in order to visualise customer information better and offer more personalised servicesai will be also used more in fraud detection where deep learning is used for delivering predictive models of transactions based on attributes such as their likelihood of being fraudulent as an example in 2016 citi group started correlating data from multiple unrelated and various sources which they believe has the potential to catch fraudulent activities earlier than current methods they claim that this doesn’t only improve fraud detection but also decreases the number of false positives more financial institutions are planning to leverage ai for fraud detection and apply machine learning to connect relations between different customers transactions and graphs of cash flow patterns with enhanced visualisation capabilitiesthe finance industry will continue to proactively deploying ai technologies as a matter of fact idc financial insights predicts total it spending by financial institutions globally will exceed 310 billion by 2019 which proves to us that we will be seeing more use cases in the futureif you want to learn more about the impact of ai in the fintech industry you can take a look at our articles hereone of the most beneficial outcomes of ai for customer service we will see in next years is personalisation ai algorithms will able to track analyse and visualise customer data behavioural demographics location etc in order for organisations to determine the customer identity and in addition to recommend the best servicein addition to better identifying consumer preferences ai tools will react with insight and emotional intelligence soon therefore another application where we will not only hear about but also start to experience in 2018 is virtual assistants chatbots or roboadvisors they won’t just only understand emotions and act proactively but they will also suppress language barriers which is currently a big disturbance in customer services customers will easily have conversations in their own languages and chatbots will understand their problems and give recommendations accordingly when added the increased speed these improvements will definitely build more meaningful relationships with customers maybe better than humans when this is the case we can say that there will be an explosion of companies focused on enabling chatbots and digital assistants within a yearorganisations are already harnessing artificial intelligence technology to reduce the time and effort spent on routine frequent and repetitive operational tasks accentura survey ‘benefits of robotics in financial services’ indicates that in some areas in the banking industry time to perform tasks was reduced by up to 90 with the addition of chatbots and virtual assistants that can understand human emotions and act proactively more jobs will be performed by machines by the end of 2017this might sound threatening at first since it looks like humans are likely to lose their jobs to machines however as more jobs become automated there will be more people working on the automation training building maintenance repairing etc therefore next year we will see new types of jobs and organisational roles within the industries also artificial intelligence will open employees up to the ability to be creative and direct them to highervalue tasks and more strategic activitiesanother important point is machines will be taking over most of the dangerous jobs currently drones are used in bomb defusing still requiring human control however ai integration will be also used for controlling the drones in the future other hazardous jobs will be also reconsidered for ai integration for example welding well known for producing toxic substances intense heat and loud noise will be outsourced to robots in most cases that will prevent humans from bodily harm2016 was the first year when artificial intelligence started to be in our lives truly with significantly increasing startups developing remarkable projects in fact ai startups have attracted over a billion dollars in exits in 2016 this year and next year we will not only see more startups with more sophisticated products but also see new players other than usbased tech companies such as china with clear benefits across industries ai will be integrated more into our lives and continue to revolutionise our world… advertising is poised to thrive in a market where customization

astronomers at the university of texas at austin in partnership with google have used artificial intelligence ai to uncover two more hidden planets in the kepler space telescope archive the technique shows promise for identifying many additional planets that traditional methods could not catchthe planets discovered this time were from kepler’s extended mission called k2to find them the team led by an undergraduate at ut austin anne dattilo created an algorithm that sifts through the data taken by kepler to ferret out signals that were missed by traditional planethunting methods long term the process should help astronomers find many more missed planets hiding in kepler data the discoveries have been accepted for publication in an upcoming issue of the astronomical journalother team members include nasa sagan fellow at ut austin andrew vanderburg and google engineer christopher shallue in 2017 vanderburg and shallue first used ai to uncover a planet around a kepler star — one already known to harbor seven planets the discovery made that solar system the only one known to have as many planets as our owndattilo explained that this project necessitated a new algorithm as data taken during kepler’s extended mission k2 differs significantly from that collected during the spacecraft’s original mission“k2 data is more challenging to work with because the spacecraft is moving around all the time” vanderburg explained this change came about after a mechanical failure while mission planners found a workaround the spacecraft was left with a wobble that ai had to take into accountthe kepler and k2 missions have already discovered thousands of planets around other stars with an equal number of candidates awaiting confirmation so why do astronomers need to use ai to search the kepler archive for more“ai will help us search the data set uniformly” vanderburg said “even if every star had an earthsized planet around it when we look with kepler we won’t find all of them that’s just because some of the data’s too noisy or sometimes the planets are just not aligned right so we have to correct for the ones we missed we know there are a lot of planets out there that we don’t see for those reasons“if we want to know how many planets there are in total we have to know how many planets we’ve found but we also have to know how many planets we missed that’s where this comes in” he explainedthe two planets dattilo’s team found “are both very typical of planets found in k2” she said “they’re really close in to their host star they have short orbital periods and they’re hot they are slightly larger than earth”of the two planets one is called k2293b and orbits a star 1300 lightyears away in the constellation aquarius the other k2294b orbits a star 1230 lightyears away also located in aquariusonce the team used their algorithm to find these planets they followed up by studying the host stars using groundbased telescopes to confirm that the planets are real these observations were done with the 15meter telescope at the smithsonian institution’s whipple observatory in arizona and the gillett telescope at gemini observatory in hawaiithe future of the ai concept for finding planets hidden in data sets looks bright the current algorithm can be used to probe the entire k2 data set dattilo said — approximately 300000 stars she also believes the method is applicable to kepler’s successor planethunting mission tess which launched in april 2018 kepler’s mission ended later that yeardattilo plans to continue her work using ai for planet hunting

necessarily require the full extent of ai capabilities this limit of machine intelligence is known to researchers as narrow intelligencethere is little doubt among the community that artificial machines will be capable of intelligent thought in the near future its just a question of what and when the machines may be pure silicon quantum computers or hybrid combinations of manufactured components and neural tissue as for the date expect great things to happen within this centurywhat about the future of artificial intelligencethere are many different approaches to artificial intelligence none of which are either completely right or wrong some are obviously more suited than others in some cases but any working alternative can be defended over the years trends have emerged based on the state of mind of influencial researchers funding opportunities as well as available computer hardwareover the past five decades ai research has mostly been focusing on solving specific problems numerous solutions have been devised and improved to do so efficiently and reliably this explains why the field of artificial intelligence is split into many branches ranging from pattern recognition to artificial life including evolutionary computation and planningshow me artificial intelligence knowledgethe potential applications of artificial intelligence are abundant they stretch

the year before but if you learned like an ai system does you actually would have — as you sat down for your first day of class your brain would take that as a cue to wipe the slate clean and start from scratchai systems’ tendency to forget the things it previously learned upon taking on new information is called catastrophic forgettingthat’s a big problem see cuttingedge algorithms learn so to speak after analyzing countless examples of what they’re expected to do a facial recognition ai system for instance will analyze thousands of photos of people’s faces likely photos that have been manually annotated so that it will be able to detect a face when it pops up in a video feed but because these ai systems don’t actually comprehend the underlying logic of what they do teaching them to do anything else even if it’s pretty similar — like say recognizing specific emotions — means training them all over again from scratch once an algorithm is trained it’s done we can’t update it anymorefor years scientists have been trying to figure out how to work around the problem if they succeed ai systems would be able to learn from a new set of training data without overwriting most of what they already knew in the process basically if the robots should someday rise up our new overlords would be able to conquer all life on earth and chew bubblegum at the same timebut still catastrophic forgetting is one of the major hurdles preventing scientists from building an artificial general intelligence agi — ai that’s allencompassing empathetic and imaginative like the ones we see in tv and moviesin fact a number of ai experts who attended the joint multiconference on humanlevel artificial intelligence last week in prague said in private interviews with futurism or during panels and presentations that the problem of catastrophic forgetting is one of the top reasons they don’t expect to see agi or humanlevel ai anytime soonbut irina higgins a senior research scientist at google deepmind used her presentation during the conference to announce that her team had begun to crack the codeshe had developed an ai agent — sort of like a video game character controlled by an ai algorithm — that could think more creatively than a typical algorithm it could “imagine” what the things it encountered in one virtual environment might look like elsewhere in other words the neural net was able to disentangle certain objects that it encountered in a simulated environment from the environment itselfthis isn’t the same as a human’s imagination where we can come up with new mental images altogether think of a bird — you can probably conjure up an image of what a fictional spherical red bird might look like in your mind’s eye the ai system isn’t that sophisticated but it can imagine objects that it’s already seen in new configurations or locations“we want a machine to learn safe common sense in its exploration so it’s not damaging itself” said higgins in her speech at the conference which had been organized by goodai she had published her paper on the preprint server arxiv earlier that week describing work that allows previouslydeveloped ai agents to continuously learn without forgetting earlier traininglet’s say you’re walking through the desert as one does and you come across a cactus one of those big twoarmed ones you see in all the cartoons you can recognize that this is a cactus because you have probably encountered one before maybe your office bought some succulents to liven up the place but even if your office is cactusfree you could probably imagine what this desert cactus would look like in a big clay pot maybe next to brenda from accounting’s desknow higgins’ ai system can do pretty much the same thing with just five examples of how a given object looks from various angles the ai agent learns what it is how it relates to the environment and also how it might look from other angles it hasn’t seen or in different lighting the paper highlights how the algorithm was trained to spot a white suitcase or an armchair after its training the algorithm can then imagine how that object would look in an entirely new virtual world and recognize the object when it encounters it there“we run the exact setup that i used to motivate this model and then we present an image from one environment and ask the model to imagine what it would look like in a different environment” higgins said again and again her new algorithm excelled at the task compared to ai systems with entangled representations which could predict fewer qualities and characteristics of the objectsin short the algorithm is able to note differences between what it encounters and what it has seen in the past like most people but unlike most other algorithms the new system higgins built for google can understand that it hasn’t come across a brand new object just because it’s seeing something from a new angle it can then use some spare computational power to take in that new information the ai system updates what it knows about the world without needing to be retrained and relearn everything all over again basically the system is able to transfer and apply its existing knowledge to the new environment the end result is a sort of spectrum or continuum showing how it understands various qualities of an objecthiggins’ model alone won’t get us to agi of course but it marks an important first step towards ai algorithms that can continuously update as they go learning new things about the world without losing what they already had“i think it’s very crucial to reach anything close to artificial general intelligence” higgins saidand this work is all still in its early stages these algorithms like many other object recognition ai tools excel at a rather narrow task with a constrained set of rules such as looking at a photo and picking out a face among many things that are not faces but higgins’ new ai system is doing a narrow task in such a way that more closely resembles creativity and some digital simulation of an imaginationand even though higgins’ research didn’t immediately bring about the era of artificial general intelligence her new algorithm already has the ability to improve the existing ai systems we use all the time for instance higgins tried her new ai system on a major set of data used to train facial recognition software after analyzing the thousands and thousands of headshots found in the dataset the algorithm could create a spectrum of any quality with which those photos have been labeled as an example higgins presented the spectrum of faces ranked by skin tonehiggins then revealed that her algorithm was able to do the same for the subjective qualities that also find their ways into these datasets ultimately teaching human biases to facial recognition ai higgins showed how images that people had labeled as “attractive” created a spectrum that pointed straight towards the photos of young pale women that means any ai system that had been trained with these photos — and there are many of them out there — now hold the same racist views as do the people who labeled the photos in the first place that white people are more attractivethis creative new algorithm is already better than we are when it comes to finding new ways to detect human biases in other algorithms so engineers can go in and remove themso while it can’t replace artists quite yet higgins’ team’s work is a pretty big step towards getting ai to imagine more like a human and less like an algorithmmore on artificial general intelligence advanced artificial intelligence could run the world better than humans ever could'})

pathological or beneficialarticlemar 2012theor comput scimitja luštrek ivan bratko matjaz gamsminimax search which is used by most gameplaying programs is considered pathological when deeper searches produce worse evaluations than shallower ones this phenomenon was first observed in theoretical analyses under seemingly reasonable conditions it was most commonly explained by the lack of dependence between nearby positions in the analyses if nearby positions have similar values as is typically the case in real games the pathology no longer occurs in this paper we show that the pathology can be eliminated even without positionvalue dependence by assigning enough different values to the positions and modeling the heuristic error as normally distributed noise that is independent of the depth in the game tree this leads to the conclusion that minimax is less prone to the pathology than was previously thought and indicates the importance of the number of different position valuesviewshow

grabs ai could contribute up to 157 trillion1 to the global economy in 2030 more than the current output of china and india combined of this 66 trillion is likely to come from increased productivity and 91 trillion is likely to come from consumptionside effectswhile some markets sectors and individual businesses are more advanced than others ai is still at a very early stage of development overall from a macroeconomic point of view there are therefore opportunities for emerging markets to leapfrog more developed counterparts and within your business sector one of today’s startups or a business that hasn’t even been founded yet could be the market leader in ten years’ timeview how we got our resultsai is set to be the key source of transformation disruption and competitive advantage

which small deviations flag a possible health condition in need of further investigation and treatment ai is initially likely to be adopted as an aid rather than replacement for human physicians it will augment physicians’ diagnoses but in the process also provide valuable insights for the ai to learn continuously and improve this continuous interaction between human physicians and the aipowered diagnostics will enhance the accuracy of the systems and over time provide enough confidence for humans to delegate the task entirely to the ai system to operate autonomouslybarriers to overcomeit would be necessary to address concerns over the privacy and protection of sensitive health data the complexity of human biology and the need for further technological development also mean than some of the more advanced applications may take time to reach their potential and gain acceptance from patients healthcare providers and regulatorsview morehigh potential use case autonomous fleets for ride sharingautonomous fleets would enable travellers to access the vehicle they need at that point rather than having to make do with what they have or pay for insurance and maintenance on a car that sits in the drive for much of the time most of the necessary data is available and technology is advancing however businesses still need to win consumer trustbarriers to overcometechnology still needs development – having an autonomous vehicle perform safely under extreme weather conditions might prove more challenging even if the technology is in place it would need to gain consumer trust and regulatory acceptanceview morehigh potential use case personalised financial planningwhile human financial advice is costly and time consuming ai developments such as roboadvice have made it possible to develop customised investment solutions for mass market consumers in ways that would until recently only have been available to high net worth hnw clients finances are managed dynamically to match

being produced uniformly apparels and consumables can be tailored on demand if we look at fashion and clothing as an example we could eventually move to fully interactive and customised design and

tl and large online retailers vertically integrating their tlbarriers to overcometechnology for autonomous fleets is still in developmentview morethe starting point for strategic evaluation is a scan of the technological developments and competitive pressures coming up within your sector how quickly they will arrive and how you will respond you can then identify the operational pain points that automation and other ai techniques could address what disruptive opportunities are opened up by the ai that’s available now and what’s coming up on the horizonin determining your strategic response key questions include how can different ai options help you to deliver your business goals and what is your appetite and readiness for change do you want to be an early adopter fast follower or follower is your strategic objective for ai to transform your business or to disrupt your sectorwhile investment in ai may seem expensive now pwc subject matter specialists anticipate that the costs will decline over the next ten years as the software becomes more commoditised eventually we’ll move towards a free or ‘freemium’ model for simple activities and a premium model for businessdifferentiating services while the enabling technology is likely to be increasingly commoditised the supply of data and how it’s used are set to become the primary assettrust and transparency are critical in relation to autonomous vehicles for example ai requires people to trust their lives to a machine – that’s a huge leap of faith for both passengers and public policymakers anything that goes wrong be it a malfunction or a crash is headline news and this reputational risk applies to all forms of ai not just autonomous vehicles customer engagement robots have been known to acquire

others does an intelligent decision include doing things to reduce negative outcomesimagine you touch a stove and it’s hot and your hand burns two days later you are in front of another stove would you touch the stove without thinking or would you remember how you burned your hand and try to figure out if the stove is hot before you touch itnot touching the stove the second time is an example of intelligence the ability to gain and apply knowledge and skills remembering your hand was burned the first time is not intelligence intelligence is the ability to take your memory then do something based on the details of the memoryit also turns out intelligence has different definitions and ways to decide who or what is intelligent there’s emotional intelligence the ability to connect with people and read their emotions there’s practical intelligence the ability to figure out how to cook food or build a desk most of us think of intelligence in intellectual terms what you know how much you know and how you apply your knowledgecomputers are great at some things but not others so it’s no surprise building computers that are intelligent is complicated scientists and programmers are busy trying to make computers have artificial intelligence the ability to gain and apply knowledge and skills artificial intelligence also is called ai the term was coined in 1955 by john mccarthy a computer scientist working on the problem of making computers intelligentif a computer is intelligent however is it really artificial intelligence or is intelligence a more accurate word to use we don’t say “jane has great human intelligence” we say instead “jane has great intelligence she’s smart” maybe intelligent computers are simply intelligent the way people are intelligent as a result of parenting school and life experiences some day the term artificial intelligence may disappear when computers become more like human beings capable of more independent thoughtyou might have heard of watson the ibm computer that can answer questions in the style of the jeopardy quiz show watson is capable of responding to questions posed naturally also known as natural language by processing massive amounts of structured and unstructured data the question and answer format however limits its intelligence to the data watson consumesto teach computers how to be intelligent researchers train them to play and beat old video games games provide a limited universe with a set of rules computers play the games and use trial and error to figure out different ways to win the same way we do when playing these games they use memory to build on successes and learn from mistakesa more direct example of computers processing data and gaining intelligence through experience are fanuc industrial robots these robots share data as they all learn how to sort parts in bins each robot snaps a picture of a bin analyzes the photo for clues that match what its programming code tells it to pick up then picks up what the robot thinks is the correct part successes and mistakes are shared among the robots the result is a robot that can learn to process parts in a bin with 90 accuracy in a matter of eight hours starting with no knowledgethere are other interesting projects with computers and artificial intelligencefor example mit has a project called dragonbot which helps young kids learn however it requires a human to operate the intelligent robot at a distance out of sight which is called the wizard of oz effect or woz in the book and the movie the wizard of oz is a scary person who turns out to be a little man standing behind a curtain who operates machines which make him sound scaryhowever the woz effect with dragonbot is not about scaring kids it’s about building a computer that can share the curiosity kids have and encourage kids to explore what interests them dragonbot responds to what kids say and their answers to questions dragonbot asksthe wikipedia online reference site also uses artificial intelligence to help in their article editing process their software identifies and flags potential bogus articles human editors are freed up to focus on more complicated tasks while the software handles mundane tasksanother media related use of artificial intelligence involves reporting sports events the financial markets and business news narrative science offers a product called quill which collects facts and turns them into what they call data storytelling and humans call articles and content the results are similar and in some cases more comprehensive than a human reporting the same event and factsthe associated press for example uses software from automated insights to write thousands of articles instead of hundreds instead of writing one article to be read by many the goal is to write many articles for often small audiences of readerswhile buying software to write reports and articles sounds wonderful it’s unclear whether or not the software fact checks with human sources there are plenty of examples online where misinformation or false information is repeated endlessly in computer terms it’s called gigo or garbage in garbage out presumably these articles are fact checked by humans somewhere in the processin the near future driving cars will be automated in part — maybe parallel parking — or completely the sensors and software will blend together to create artificial intelligence the software will need to handle routine tasks like right turns or parking and unexpected situations since the 1990s cars have used the can bus technology standard to manage sensors located all over a car in the future these sensors will connect to software that makes decisions as you drive down a roadyou also might be familiar with siri on the iphone or cortana on windows android and iphones both are intelligent personal assistants ipa who listen to your requests for information and perform tasks you might ask siri for example to add an event to your calendar or dial your best friend’s phone number these applications combine speech recognition image matching natural language processing and question and answer systemssiri cortana and other personal assistant software use information stored on multiple computers connected to the internet that can act as one computer this makes a vast network of data and processing power available to answer queries in real time other more complicated intelligent machines use a neural network which is like a mesh net with lots of small lights on it the human brain is a neural network with data from experience stored in different places recalling a memory of your favorite food triggers some lights in the network in your brain but not all lights figuring out how to create a neural network for a computer to use is a really interesting problem to solve neural networks also harness the power of multiple computers to store vast amounts of data and provide processing powergoogle recently open sourced their tensor flow project code which makes it available to anyone interested to experiment with neural network software and data sets there are other data sets and software available for programmers and researchersas with any new technology whether or not artificial intelligence software will be good or bad for humanity is an open question definitely ai software will put people out of jobs and it is equally certain ai will create jobs for example programming and fixing robotsit is possible software and machines with artificial intelligence also will treat people unfairly and kill people this is already a reality in the world before software and intelligent computers people acted unfairly and worse towards people willfully and based on lack of information or misinformationperhaps the more interesting question is how humans will set limits for intelligent computers and how those limits will be

news office february 11 2019karllydie jeanbaptisteemail kjeanbapmiteduphone 617 2531682mit newsapplying just a bit of strain to a piece of semiconductor or other crystalline material can deform the orderly arrangement of atoms in its structure enough to cause dramatic changes in its properties such as the way it conducts electricity transmits light or conducts heatnow a team of researchers at mit and in russia and singapore have found ways to use artificial intelligence to help predict and control these changes potentially opening up new avenues of research on advanced materials for future hightech devicesthe findings appear this week in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences in a paper authored by mit professor of nuclear science and engineering and of materials science and engineering ju li mit principal research scientist ming dao and mit graduate student zhe shi with evgenii tsymbalov and alexander shapeev at the skolkovo institute of science and technology in russia and subra suresh the vannevar bush professor emeritus and former dean of engineering at mit and current president of nanyang technological university in singaporealready based on earlier work at mit some degree of elastic strain has been incorporated in some silicon processor chips even a 1 percent change in the structure can in some cases improve the speed of the device by 50 percent by allowing electrons to move through the material fasterrecent research by suresh dao and yang lu a former mit postdoc now at city university of hong kong showed that even diamond the strongest and hardest material found in nature can be elastically stretched by as much as 9 percent without failure when it is in the form of nanometersized needles li and yang similarly demonstrated that nanoscale wires of silicon can be stretched purely elastically by more than 15 percent these discoveries have opened up new avenues to explore how devices can be fabricated with even more dramatic changes in the materials’ propertiesstrain made to orderunlike other ways of changing a material’s properties such as chemical doping which produce a permanent static change strain engineering allows properties to be changed on the fly “strain is something you can turn on and off dynamically” li saysbut the potential of strainengineered materials has been hampered by the daunting range of possibilities strain can be applied in any of six different ways in three different dimensions each one of which can produce strain inandout or sideways and with nearly infinite gradations of degree so the full range of possibilities is impractical to explore simply by trial and error “it quickly grows to 100 million calculations if we want to map out the entire elastic strain space” li saysthat’s where this team’s novel application of machine learning methods comes to the rescue providing a systematic way of exploring the possibilities and homing in on the appropriate amount and direction of strain to achieve a given set of properties for a particular purpose “now we have this very highaccuracy method” that drastically reduces the complexity of the calculations needed li says“this work is an illustration of how recent advances in seemingly distant fields such as material physics artificial intelligence computing and machine learning can be brought together to advance scientific knowledge that has strong implications for industry application” suresh saysthe new method the researchers say could open up possibilities for creating materials tuned precisely for electronic optoelectronic and photonic devices that could find uses for communications information processing and energy applicationswhen a small amount of strain is applied to a crystalline material like silicon its properties can change dramatically for example it can shift from blocking electrical current to conducting it freely like a metal credit frank shithe team studied the effects of strain on the bandgap a key electronic property of semiconductors in both silicon and diamond using their neural network algorithm they were able to predict with high accuracy how different amounts and orientations of strain would affect the bandgap“tuning” of a bandgap can be a key tool for improving the efficiency of a device such as a silicon solar cell by getting it to match more precisely the kind of energy source that it is designed to harness by finetuning its bandgap for example it may be possible to make a silicon solar cell that is just as effective at capturing sunlight as its counterparts but is only onethousandth as thick in theory the material “can even change from a semiconductor to a metal and that would have many applications if that’s doable in a massproduced product” li sayswhile it’s possible in some cases to induce similar changes by other means such as putting the material in a strong electric field or chemically altering it those changes tend to have many side effects on the material’s behavior whereas changing the strain has fewer such side effects for example li explains an electrostatic field often interferes with the operation of the device because it affects the way electricity flows through it changing the strain produces no such interferencediamond’s potentialdiamond has great potential as a semiconductor material though it’s still in its infancy compared to silicon technology “it’s an extreme material with high carrier mobility” li says referring to the way negative and positive carriers of electric current move freely through diamond because of that diamond could be ideal for some kinds of highfrequency electronic devices and for power electronicsby some measures li says diamond could potentially perform 100000 times better than silicon but it has other limitations including the fact that nobody has yet figured out a good and scalable way to put diamond layers on a large substrate the material is also difficult to “dope” or introduce other atoms into a key part of semiconductor manufacturingby mounting the material in a frame that can be adjusted to change the amount and orientation of the strain dao says “we can have considerable flexibility” in altering its dopant behaviorwhereas this study focused specifically on the effects of strain on the materials’ bandgap “the method is generalizable” to other aspects which affect not only electronic properties but also other properties such as photonic and magnetic behavior li says from the 1 percent strain now being used in commercial chips many new applications open up now that this team has shown that strains of nearly 10 percent are possible without fracturing “when you get to more than 7 percent strain you really change a lot in the material” he says“this new method could potentially lead to the design of unprecedented material properties” li says “but much further work will be needed to figure out how to impose the strain and how to scale up the process to do it on 100 million transistors on a chip and ensure that none of them can fail”“this innovative new work demonstrates potential to significantly accelerate the engineering of exotic electronic properties in ordinary materials via large elastic strains” says evan reed an associate professor of materials science and engineering at stanford university who was not involved in this research “it sheds light on the opportunities and limitations that nature exhibits for such strain engineering and it will be of interest to a broad spectrum of researchers working on important technologies”the work was
