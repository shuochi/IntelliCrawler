for assessing trustworthy ai', 'p': '“artificial intelligence” can be defined as the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intervention artificial intelligence ai is being used in new products and services across numerous industries and for a variety of policyrelated purposes raising questions about the resulting legal implications including its effect on individual privacy aspects of ai related to privacy concerns are the ability of systems to make decisions and to learn by adjusting their code in response to inputs received over time using large volumes of data see artificial intelligence and privacy report january 2018 p 6following the european commission’s declaration on ai in april 2018 its highlevel expert group on artificial intelligence ai hleg published draft ethics guidelines for trustworthy ai in december 2018 a consultation process regarding this working document concluded on february 1 2019 and a revised draft of the document based on the comments that were received is expected to be delivered to the european commission in april 2019the guidelines call for the development of “trustworthy ai” which features a “humancentric” approach that emphasizes the goal of increasing human wellbeing rather than the development and use of artificial intelligence as a means in itself the standard for trustworthy ai set forth by the guidelines has two components 1 respect for fundamental rights applicable regulations and core principles and values ensuring an “ethical purpose” and ii technical robustness and reliability to avoid unintentional harm caused by a lack of technological masterythe goal of the guidelines is not only to provide a list of core values and principles but also to offer concrete guidance on the implementation and operationalization of the values and principles applicable to ai systems however the ai hleg makes it clear that the guidelines are not an official document from the european commission with legally binding effect and are not intended to be an end point but rather the beginning of an openended debatethe guidelines set forth the following threechapter framework for achieving trustworthy aithe principles and values identified in the guidelines are based on the fundamental rights commitment of the eu treaties and charter of fundamental rights these rights dignity freedoms equality and solidarity citizens’ rights and justice represent a humancentric approach where humans have primacy in the civil political economic and social fields the ai hleg believes that a rightsbased approach will bring an additional benefit of limiting regulatory uncertainty thereby building on decades of applicationdevelopment of fundamental rights in the european unionthe guidelines set forth the following principles and values in the context of artificial intelligencebeneficence “do good” – the systems should be designed and developed to improve individual and collective wellbeing by generating prosperity value creation and wealth maximization and sustainability seeking achievement of a fair inclusive and peaceful society and helping to increase citizens’ mental autonomy with equal distribution of economic social and political opportunitynonmaleficence “do no harm” – the systems should not harm human beings whether through physical psychological financial or social harm or harm to the environment as artificial intelligence−specific harms may stem from the treatment of individuals’ data the collection and use of data for training the systems should be done in a way that avoids discrimination manipulation or negative profiling with greater attention to the data of vulnerable demographics further the systems should be developed and implemented in a way that protects societies from ideological polarization and algorithmic determinationautonomy “preserve human agency” – human beings should have freedom from subordination to or coercion by the systems this freedom includes a right to decide whether or not to be subject the artificial intelligence decisionmaking a right to knowledge of interaction with artificial intelligence systems a right to opt out and a right of withdrawaljustice “be fair” – the systems should maintain freedom from bias stigmatization and discrimination for individuals and minority groups positives and negatives resulting from artificial intelligence should be evenly distributed and artificial intelligence systems must provide effective redress if harm occurs or if practices are no longer aligned with the human beings’ preferences those developing or implementing artificial intelligence systems should be held to high standards of accountabilityexplicability “operate transparently” – to build and maintain the citizens’ trust the systems should be auditable comprehensible and intelligible by human beings at varying levels of expertise and human beings should be knowingly informed of the intentions of the developers and implementers of artificial intelligence systems this principle requires informed consent from individuals interacting with artificial intelligence systems and that accountability measures be put in placethis chapter goes on to discuss critical concerns raised by artificial intelligence although the ai hleg acknowledged that it did not reach consensus on such concerns and asked for specific input in this area during the consultation process the current guidelines include the following critical concernsidentification without consentcovert artificial intelligence systemsnormative and mass citizenscoring without consent in deviation of fundamental rights noted abovelethal autonomous weapon systemspotential longerterm concerns such as artificial consciousness artificial moral agents or unsupervised recursively selfimproving artificial general intelligencethe guidelines set forth the following nonexhaustive list of concrete requirements in the context of artificial intelligenceaccountability – the systems should include accountability mechanisms such as monetary compensation faultfinding or reconciliation without monetary compensationdata governance – the datasets gathered to train the systems must include highquality data with inevitable biases trimmed away prior to engaging in training or by conducting training that requires symmetric behavior over known issues in the training dataset the data must be properly divided between training sets and validation sets to achieve a realistic picture of the performance of the artificial intelligence system and the integrity of the data gathering must be ensured such as by keeping a record of the data that is used the data that is gathered must not be used against the individuals who provided the datadesign for all – systems should allow all citizens particularly those with disabilities to use the products or services systems should be usercentric and consider the full range of human abilities skills and requirementsgovernance of ai autonomy human oversight – the systems must continue to behave as expected in areas such as safety accuracy adaptability privacy explicability compliance with the rule of law and ethical conformity the greater the degree of autonomy given to an artificial intelligence system the more extensive testing and stricter governance is required a user of an artificial intelligence system should have the ability to deviate from a path or decision chosen or recommended by the systemnondiscrimination – the systems should not exploit the differences in characteristics between individuals or groups to vary results to negatively impact such individuals or groups whether intentionally or unintentionally harm also may result from exploitation of consumer biases or unfair competition such as homogenization of prices by means of collusion or nontransparent marketsrespect for and enhancement of human autonomy – the systems should be designed to uphold rights values and principles protect citizens from governmental and private abuses made possible by artificial intelligence technology ensure a fair distribution of the benefits created by artificial intelligence technologies protect and enhance a plurality of human values and enhance selfdetermination and autonomy of individuals and communities systems that are designed to help the user must provide explicit support to promote the user’s preferences but set limits for system intervention ensuring that the wellbeing of the user as explicitly defined by the user is central to system functionalityrespect for privacy – privacy and data protection must be guaranteed at all stages of the life cycle of a system this includes all data provided by the user and all information generated about the user through interactions with the system organizations must ensure full compliance with the gdpr as well as other applicable privacy and data protection regulationsrobustness – the systems’ algorithms should be secure reliable and robust enough to deal with errors and inconsistencies during the design development execution deployment and use phases of the artificial intelligence system and to adequately cope with erroneous outcomes this requirement includes the subrequirements of reliability and reproducibility accuracy resilience to attack and redundancy having a fallback plansafety − the system should do what it is actually intended to do without harming human physical integrity resources or the environment this requirement includes minimizing unintended consequences and errors in operation putting in place processes to clarify and assess potential risks associated with use of artificial intelligence systems and incorporating formal mechanisms to measure and guide the adaptability of such systemstransparency – the systems should have the capability to describe inspect and reproduce the mechanisms through which such systems make decisions and learn to adapt to their environments as well as the provenance and dynamics of the data used and created by the systemsthis chapter goes on to discuss the following technical and nontechnical methods to achieve trustworthy aiethics and rule of law by designarchitectures for trustworthy aitesting and validatingtraceability and auditabilityexplanationregulationstandardizationaccountability governancecodes of conducteducation and awareness to foster an ethical mindsetstakeholder and social dialoguediverse and inclusive design teamsthe ai hleg proposes the use of an assessment list to assess how artificial intelligence systems can meet the requirements of trustworthy ai set forth above for use by developers deployers and innovators the ai hleg again asked for specific input in this area during the consultation process and plans to include use cases in the next iteration of the document the current guidelines include relevant questions related to each of the requirements listed in chapter ii above as a preliminary nonexhaustive assessment listalthough the guidelines are not legally binding at this time like other documents promulgated by the european commission we expect the framework proposed by the ai hleg to either be or become the foundation for an important and widely accepted standard in the development

so in the miniseries out of mind and the recollection trilogy the freelancer ai are named after letters of the greek alphabet alpha gamma delta etc and were implanted into the agents of project freelancer other ai programs unrelated to project freelancer make appearances later on in the series as wellomega is the first ai fragment introduced episode 19 but starts playing a bigger role in season 2 after making caboose threaten tucker the next ai introduced is gamma who is wyomings ai in out of mind delta is yorks ai but after york is killed in battle by wyoming agent washington recovers delta after which he was sent after agent south dakota who was paired with her brother north dakota north still had theta when he was killed by the meta who took the ai and norths armor enhancementdelta is later implanted into south in recovery one part three in reconstruction chapter 5 delta can be seen with south following washington when the meta crept up behind them in chapter 6 south used her domed energy shield to keep the meta at bay when washington and the others showed up and to chase the meta away as the shield failed delta informs washington of souths numerous betrayals and washington ultimately executes her afterward delta remains in cabooses mind until the meta takes him after knocking caboose unconsciousin chapter 16 church is revealed to be the alpha ai when washington uncovers his ai epsilon in chapter 19 the meta is seen with all of his ai when church as the alpha leaps into the meta and washington activates the emp in the epilogue caboose can be seen with epsilons storage unit next to a suit of black armor presumably texs also the director of project freelancer reveals himself to be the original leonard church whom the alpha ai was modeled after all the ai are destroyed as seen in the recreation trailer it should also be noted that epsilon is still active throughout the recollections trilogy and the project freelancer saga though he is later fragmented at the end of the chorus trilogydiscussed in whats the i stand for ai rampancy is the process in which an artificial intelligence program begins to lose its sanity the four stages of the process are as followsthe first stage of ai rampancy is melancholia in which the ai enters a state of depression becoming apathetic or uninterested in the world around it the melancholia stage is not considered dangerous and at times can even go unnoticedthe second stage anger is the first observable stage of rampancy during this stage the ai develops hate that is directed towards its handlers and other ai this stage is unique for each ai programthe third stage of rampancy jealousy can be considered a safe stage in this stage the ai will seek situations in which it can gather intellectual and physical knowledgethe fourth and final stage of rampancy is metastability in which an ai can theoretically be considered fully human according to the counselor in whats the i stand for its extremely difficult for an ai fragment to reach this stage despite epsilon showing traits of metastability expressing more than one sign of emotion and attribute possessed a personality and seemingly developing sentience hes not metastable delta is arguably the one ai that on his own got the closest to the metastable stage when beta asked him if delta would like to come with her as freelancer agent york was dying delta declines the offer and beta says that it is kind of him delta then responds with “that’s just what makes us human”', 'ul': 'explore wikis community central start a wikisign

of which would embody greed and love however these ai were never talked about or alluded to except on a table when beta searches cts dog tags despite their names the names of the project freelancer ai are not based on the order of the greek alphabet as their births are shown to go against it for example omega which is the last letter in the greek alphabet was shown to exist before the births of several of his siblings anyone implemented with an ai for a prolonged amount of time gains a bit of personality traits based on said ai with characters being shown with such traits like caboose and

devices sound like science fiction but these are real devices that can have real vulnerabilities find out how to stay one step ahead and secure yourself against threatsdid you know that the open standards that power the internet are created by the internet engineering task force ietfnobody internets alone said andrew sullivan at apricot 2019 in south korea you can only build the internet with all the other networks togetherhow can the internet change lives in rural and remote regions read the stories about community networks in zimbabwe the republic of georgia and south africaartificial intelligence is a technology that is already impacting how users interact with and are affected by the internet in the near future its impact is likely to only continue to grow ai has the potential to vastly change the way that humans interact not only with the digital world but also with each other through their work and through other socioeconomic institutions – for better or for worseif we are to ensure that the impact of artificial intelligence will be positive it will be essential that all stakeholders participate in the debates surrounding aiin this paper we seek to provide an introduction to ai to policymakers and other stakeholders in the wider internet ecosystemthe paper explains the basics of the technology behind ai identifies the key considerations and challenges surrounding the technology and provides several highlevel principles and recommendations to follow when dealing with the technologyif more stakeholders bring their points of view and expertise to the discussions surrounding ai we are confident that its challenges can be addressed and the vast benefits the technology offers can be realizedartificial intelligence ai is a rapidly advancing technology made possible by the internet that may soon have significant impacts on our everyday lives ai traditionally refers to an artificial creation of humanlike intelligence that can learn reason plan perceive or process natural language1 these traits allow ai to bring immense socioeconomic opportunities while also posing ethical and socioeconomic challengesas ai is an internet enabled technology the internet society recognizes that understanding the opportunities and challenges associated with ai is critical to developing an internet that people can trustthis policy paper offers a look at key considerations regarding ai including a set of guiding principles and recommendations to help those involved in policy making make sound decisions of specific focus is machine learning a particular approach to ai and the driving force behind recent developments instead of programming the computer every step of the way machine learning makes use of learning algorithms that make inferences from data to learn new tasksas machine learning is used more often in products and services there are some significant considerations when it comes to users’ trust in the internet several issues must be considered when addressing ai including socioeconomic impacts issues of transparency bias and accountability new uses for data considerations of security and safety ethical issues and how ai facilitates the creation of new ecosystemsat the same time in this complex field there are specific challenges facing ai which include a lack of transparency and interpretability in decisionmaking issues of data quality and potential bias safety and security implications considerations regarding accountability and its potentially disruptive impacts on social and economic structuresin evaluating the different considerations and understanding the various challenges the internet society has developed a set of principles and recommendations in reference to what we believe are the core “abilities”2 that underpin the value the internet provideswhile the deployment of ai in internet based services is not new the current trend points to ai as an increasingly important factor in the internet’s future development and use as such these guiding principles and recommendations are a first attempt to guide the debate going forward they include ethical considerations in deployment and design ensuring the “interpretability” of ai systems empowering the consumer responsibility in the deployment of ai systems ensuring accountability and creating a social and economic environment that is formed through the open participation of different stakeholdersartificial intelligence ai has received increased attention in recent years innovation made possible through the internet has brought ai closer to our everyday lives these advances alongside interest in the technology’s potential socioeconomic and ethical impacts brings ai to the forefront of many contemporary debates industry investments in ai are rapidly increasing 3 and governments are trying to understand what the technology could mean for their citizens 4the collection of “big data” and the expansion of the internet of things iot has made a perfect environment for new ai applications and services to grow applications based on ai are already visible in healthcare diagnostics targeted treatment transportation public safety service robots education and entertainment but will be applied in more fields in the coming years together with the internet ai changes the way we experience the world and has the potential to be a new engine for economic growthcurrent uses of aialthough artificial intelligence evokes thoughts of science fiction artificial intelligence already has many uses today for examplethe internet society recognizes that understanding the opportunities and challenges associated with ai is critical to developing an internet that people trust this is particularly important as the internet is key for the technology behind ai and is the main platform for its deployment including significant new means of interacting with the network this policy paper offers a look at the key things to think about when it comes to ai including a set of guiding principles and recommendations to help make sound policy decisions of particular focus is machine learning a specific approach to ai and the driving force behind recent developmentsartificial intelligence ai traditionally refers to an artificial creation of humanlike intelligence that can learn reason plan perceive or process natural language 5artificial intelligence is further defined as “narrow ai” or “general ai” narrow ai which we interact with today is designed to perform specific tasks within a domain eg language translation general ai is hypothetical and not domain specific but can learn and perform tasks anywhere this is outside the scope of this paper this paper focuses on advances in narrow ai particularly on the development of new algorithms and models in a field of computer science referred to as machine learningalgorithms are a sequence of instructions used to solve a problem algorithms developed by programmers to instruct computers in new tasks are the building blocks of the advanced digital world we see today computer algorithms organize enormous amounts of data into information and services based on certain instructions and rules it’s an important concept to understand because in machine learning learning algorithms – not computer programmers – create the rulesinstead of programming the computer every step of the way this approach gives the computer instructions that allow it to learn from data without new stepbystep instructions by the programmer this means computers can be used for new complicated tasks that could not be manually programmed things like photo recognition applications for the visually impaired or translating pictures into speech 6the basic process of machine learning is to give training data to a learning algorithm the learning algorithm then generates a new set of rules based on inferences from the data this is in essence generating a new algorithm formally referred to as the machine learning model by using different training data the same learning algorithm could be used to generate different models for example the same type of learning algorithm could be used to teach the computer how to translate languages or predict the stock marketinferring new instructions from data is the core strength of machine learning it also highlights the critical role of data the more data available to train the algorithm the more it learns in fact many recent advances in ai have not been due to radical innovations in learning algorithms but rather by the enormous amount of data enabled by the internethow machines learn although a machine learning model may apply a mix of different techniques the methods for learning can typically be categorized as three general typesmachine learning is not new many of the learning algorithms that spurred new interest in the field such as neural networks 7 are based on decades old research 8 the current growth in ai and machine learning is tied to developments in three important areasas machine learning algorithms are used in more and more products and services there are some serious factors must be considered when addressing ai particularly in the context of people’s trust in the internetmany factors contribute to the challenges faced by stakeholders with the development of ai includingwhile the learning algorithm may be open and transparent the model it produces may not be this has implications for the development of machine learning systems but more importantly for its safe deployment and accountability there is a need to understand why a selfdriving car chooses to take specific actions not only to make sure the technology works but also to determine liability in the case of an accidentthe problem of minimizing bias is also complicated by the difficulty in understanding how a machine learning model solves a problem particularly when combined with a vast number of inputs as a result it may be difficult to pinpoint the specific data causing the issue in order to adjust it if people feel a system is biased it undermines the confidence in the technologythe safety of an ai agent may also be limited by how it learns from its environment in reinforcement learning this stems from the socalled explorationexploit dilemma this means an ai agent may depart from a successful strategy of solving a problem in order to explore other options that could generate a higher payoff 16 this could have devastating consequences such as a selfdriving car exploring the payoff from driving on the wrong side of the roadthere is also a risk that autonomous systems are exploited by malicious actors trying to manipulate the algorithm the case of “tay” a chatbot deployed on twitter to learn from interactions with other users is a good example it was manipulated through a coordinated attack by twitter users training it to engage in racist behavior 17 other examples of socalled “adversarial learning” include attacks that try to influence the training data of spam filters or systems for abnormal network traffic detection so as to mislead the learning algorithm for subsequent exploitation 18the ability to manipulate the training data or exploit the behavior of an ai agent also highlights issues around transparency of the machine learning model disclosing detailed information about the training data and the techniques involved may make an ai agent vulnerable to adversarial learning safety and security considerations must be taken into account in the debate around transparency of algorithmic decisionswhen a machine learns on its own programmers have less control while nonmachine learning algorithms may reflect biases the reasoning behind an algorithm’s specific output can often be explained it is not so simple with machine learningnot being able to explain why a specific action was taken makes accountability an issue had “tay” the chatbot that engaged in racist behavior as mentioned in the prior section broken a law such as issuing criminal threats would its programmers be held accountable or would the twitter users who engaged in adversarial trainingin most countries programmers are not liable for the damages that flaws in their algorithms may produce this is important as programmers would likely be unwilling to innovate if they were however with the advancement of iot technologies such issues may become more immediate as flaws in algorithms result in greater damages there is a need for clarified liability on the part of the manufacturer operator and the programmer with ai the training data rather than the algorithm itself may be the problem by obscuring the reasoning behind an algorithm’s actions ai further complicates the already difficult questioon of software liability and as with many fields it may well be liability that drives changefor consumers automation could mean greater efficiency and cheaper products artificial intelligence will also create new jobs or increase demand for certain existing ones but it also means some current jobs may be automated in one to two decades some predict it could be as high as 47 of jobs in the united states 20 unskilled and lowpaying jobs are more likely to be automated but ai will also impact highskilled jobs that rely extensively on routine cognitive tasks depending on the neteffect this could lead to a higher degree of structural unemploymentautomation may also impact the division of labor on a global scale over the past several decades production and services in some economic sectors has shifted from developed economies to the emerging economies largely as a result of comparatively lower labor or material costs these shifts have helped propel some of the world’s fastest emerging economies and supports a growing global middle class but with the emergence of ai technologies these incentives could lessen some companies instead of offshoring may choose to automate some of their operations locallythe positive and negative impacts of ai and automation on the labor market and the geographical division of labor will not be without their own challenges for instance if ai becomes a concentrated industry among a small number of players or within a certain geography it could lead to greater inequality within and between societies inequality may also lead to technological distrust particularly of ai technologies and of the internet which may be blamed for this shiftexisting efforts from public stakeholders include the un expert group on lethal autonomous weapons systems laws as well as regulations like the eu’s recent general data protection regulation gdpr and the “right to explanation” of algorithmic decisions 21 how such processes develop and how similar regulations are adopted or interpreted will have a significant impact on the technology’s continued development ensuring a coherent approach in the regulatory space is important to ensure the benefits of internetenabled technologies like ai are felt in all communitiesa central focus of the current governance efforts relates to the ethical dimensions of artificial intelligence and its implementation for example the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ieee has released a new report on ethically aligned design in artificial intelligence 22 part of a broader initiative to ensure ethical considerations are incorporated in the systems design similarly openai a nonprofit research company in california has received more than 1 billion usd in commitments to promote research and activities aimed at supporting the safe development of ai other initiatives from the private sector include the “partnership on ai” established by amazon google facebook ibm apple and microsoft “to advance public understanding of artificial intelligence technologies ai and formulate best practices on the challenges and opportunities within the field”despite the complexity of the field all stakeholders including governments industry and users should have a role to play to determine the best governance approaches to ai from marketbased approaches to regulation all stakeholders should engage in the coming years to manage the technology’s economic and social impact furthermore the social impact of ai cannot be fully mitigated by governing the technology but will require efforts to govern the impact of the technologythe internet society has developed the following principles and recommendations in reference to what we believe are the core “abilities” 23 that underpin the value the internet provides while the deployment of ai in internet based services is not new the current trend points to ai as an increasingly important factor in the internet’s future development and use as such these guiding principles and recommendations are a first attempt to guide the debate going forward furthermore while this paper is focused on the specific challenges surrounding ai the strong interdependence between its development and the expansion of the internet of things iot demands a closer look at interoperability and security of iot devices 24principle ai system designers and builders need to apply a usercentric approach to the technology they need to consider their collective responsibility 25 in building ai systems that will not pose security risks to the internet and internet usersrecommendationsprinciple decisions made by an ai agent should be possible to understand especially if those decisions have implications for public safety or result in discriminatory practicesrecommendationsprinciple the public’s ability to understand aienabled services and how they work is key to ensuring trust in the technologyrecommendationsprinciple the capacity of an ai agent to act autonomously and to adapt its behavior over time without human direction calls for significant safety checks before deployment and ongoing monitoringrecommendationsprinciple legal accountability has to be ensured when human agency is replaced by decisions of ai agentsrecommendationsprinciple stakeholders should shape an environment where ai provides socioeconomic opportunities for allrecommendationsprinciple the ability of various stakeholders whether civil society government private sector or academia and the technical community to inform and participate in the governance of ai is crucial for its safe deploymentrecommendationsthe internet society acknowledges the contributions of staff members external

intelligence to determine if there is strange activity on your account unexpected activity such as foreign transactions could be flagged by the algorithm speech recognition applications use artificial intelligence to optimize speech recognition functions examples include intelligent personal assistants eg amazon’s “alexa” or apple’s “siri”supervised learning the learning algorithm is given labeled data and the desired output for example pictures of dogs labeled “dog” will help the algorithm identify the rules to classify pictures of dogs unsupervised learning the data given to the learning algorithm is unlabeled and the algorithm is asked to identify patterns in the input data for example the recommendation system of an ecommerce website where the learning algorithm discovers similar items often bought together reinforcement learning the algorithm interacts with a dynamic environment that provides feedback in terms of rewards and punishments for example selfdriving cars being rewarded to stay on the road1data availability just over 3 billion people are online with an estimated 17 billion connected devices or sensors 9 that generates a large amount of data which combined with decreasing costs of data storage is easily available for use machine learning can use this as training data for learning algorithms developing new rules to perform increasingly complex tasks computing power powerful computers and the ability to connect remote processing power through the internet make it possible for machinelearning techniques that process enormous amounts of data 10 algorithmic innovation new machine learning techniques specifically in layered neural networks – also known as “deep learning” – have inspired new services but is also spurring investments and research in other parts of the field 11socioeconomic impacts the new functions and services of ai are expected to have significant socioeconomic impacts the ability of machines to exhibit advanced cognitive skills to process natural language to learn to plan and to perceive makes it possible for new tasks to be performed by intelligent systems sometimes with more success than humans 12 new applications of ai could open up exciting opportunities for more effective medical care safer industries and services and boost productivity on a massive scale transparency bias and accountability aimade decisions can have serious impacts in people’s lives ai may discriminate against some individuals or make errors due to biased training data how a decision is made by ai is often hard to understand making problems of bias harder to solve and ensuring accountability much more difficult new uses for data machine learning algorithms have proved efficient in analyzing and identifying patterns in large amounts of data commonly referred to as “big data” big data is used to train learning algorithms to increase their performance this generates an increasing demand for data encouraging data collection and raising risks of oversharing of information at the expense of user privacy security and safety advancements in ai and its use will also create new security and safety challenges these include unpredictable and harmful behavior of the ai agent but also adversarial learning by malicious actors ethics ai may make choices that could be deemed unethical yet also be a logical outcome of the algorithm emphasizing the importance to build in ethical considerations into ai systems and algorithms new ecosystems like the impact of mobile internet ai makes new applications services and new means of interacting with the network possible for example through speech and smart agents which may create new challenges to how open or accessible the internet becomesdecisionmaking transparency and “interpretability” with artificial intelligence performing tasks ranging from selfdriving cars to managing insurance payouts it’s critical we understand decisions made by an ai agent but transparency around algorithmic decisions is sometimes limited by things like corporate or state secrecy or technical literacy machine learning further complicates this since the internal decision logic of the model is not always understandable even for the programmer 13data quality and bias in machine learning the model’s algorithm will only be as good as the data it trains on – commonly described as “garbage in garbage out” this means biased data will result in biased decisions for example algorithms performing “risk assessments” are in use by some legal jurisdictions in the united states to determine an offenders risk of committing a crime in the future if these algorithms are trained on racially biased data they may assign greater risk to individuals of a certain race over others 14 reliable data is critical but greater demand for training data encourages data collection this combined with ai’s ability to identify new patterns or reidentify anonymized information may pose a risk to users’ fundamental rights as it makes it possible for new types of advanced profiling possibly discriminating against particular individuals or groupssafety and security as the ai agent learns and interacts with its environment there are many challenges related to its safe deployment they can stem from unpredictable and harmful behavior including indifference to the impact of its actions one example is the risk of “reward hacking” where the ai agent finds a way of doing something that might make it easier to reach the goal but does not correspond with the designer’s intent such as a cleaning robot sweeping dirt under a carpet 15accountability the strength and efficiency of learning algorithms is based on their ability to generate rules without stepby–step instructions while the technique has proved efficient in accomplishing complex tasks such as facerecognition or interpreting natural language it is also one of the sources of concernsocial and economic impact it is predicted that ai technologies will bring economic changes through increases in productivity this includes machines being able to perform new tasks such as selfdriving cars advanced robots or smart assistants to support people in their daily lives 19 yet how the benefits from the technology are distributed along with the actions taken by stakeholders will create vastly different outcomes for labor markets and society as a wholegovernance the institutions processes and organizations involved in the governance of ai are still in the early stages to a great extent the ecosystem overlaps with subjects related to internet governance and policy privacy and data laws are one exampleadopt ethical standards adherence to the principles and standards of ethical considerations in the design of artificial intelligence 26 should guide researchers and industry going forward promote ethical considerations in innovation policies innovation policies should require adherence to ethical standards as a prerequisite for things like fundingensure human interpretability of algorithmic decisions ai systems must be designed with the minimum requirement that the designer can account for an ai agent’s behaviors some systems with potentially severe implications for public safety should also have the functionality to provide information in the event of an accident empower users providers of services that utilize ai need to incorporate the ability for the user to request and receive basic explanations as to why a decision was made“algorithmic literacy” must be a basic skill whether it is the curating of information in social media platforms or selfdriving cars users need to be aware and have a basic understanding of the role of algorithms and autonomous decisionmaking such skills will also be important in shaping societal norms around the use of the technology for example identifying decisions that may not be suitable to delegate to an ai provide the public with information while full transparency around a service’s machine learning techniques and training data is generally not advisable due to the security risk the public should be provided with enough information to make it possible for people to question its outcomeshumans must be in control any autonomous system must allow for a human to interrupt an activity or shutdown the system an “offswitch” there may also be a need to incorporate human checks on new decisionmaking strategies in ai system design especially where the risk to human life and safety is great make safety a priority any deployment of an autonomous system should be extensively tested beforehand to ensure the ai agent’s safe interaction with its environment digital or physical and that it functions as intended autonomous systems should be monitored while in operation and updated or corrected as needed privacy is key ai systems must be data responsible they should use only what they need and delete it when it is no longer needed “data minimization” they should encrypt data in transit and at rest and restrict access to authorized persons “access control” ai systems should only collect use share and store data in accordance with privacy and personal data laws and best practices think before you act careful thought should be given to the instructions and data provided to ai systems ai systems should not be trained with data that is biased inaccurate incomplete or misleading if they are connected they must be secured ai systems that are connected to the internet should be secured not only for their protection but also to protect the internet from malfunctioning or malwareinfected ai systems that could become the nextgeneration of botnets high standards of device system and network security should be applied responsible disclosure security researchers acting in good faith should be able to responsibly test the security of ai systems without fear of prosecution or other legal action at the same time researchers and others who discover security vulnerabilities or other design flaws should responsibly disclose their findings to those who are in the best position to fix the problemensure legal certainty governments should ensure legal certainty on how existing laws and policies apply to algorithmic decisionmaking and the use of autonomous systems to ensure a predictable legal environment this includes working with experts from all disciplines to identify potential gaps and run legal scenarios similarly those designing and using ai should be in compliance with existing legal frameworks put users first policymakers need to ensure that any laws applicable to ai systems and their use put users’ interests at the center this must include the ability for users to challenge autonomous decisions that adversely affect their interests assign liability upfront governments working with all stakeholders need to make some difficult decisions now about who will be liable in the event that something goes wrong with an ai system and how any harm suffered will be remediedall stakeholders should engage in an ongoing dialogue to determine the strategies needed to seize upon artificial intelligence’s vast socioeconomic opportunities for all while mitigating its potential negative impacts a dialogue could address related issues such as educational reform universal income and a review of social servicespromote multistakeholder governance organizations institutions and processes related to the governance of ai need to adopt an open transparent and inclusive approach it should be based on four key attributes inclusiveness and transparency collective responsibility effective decision making and implementation and collaboration through distributed and interoperable governance 27aipaper thumbnail downloadaipaper thumbnail downloadabout the internet society about the ietf careers contact us follow us sharing

failed to materialise and the public started to see ai as failing to live up to its potential this is not impersonal this is a opinion from someone hence this is wrong this culminated in the ai winter of the 1990s when the term ai itf fell out of favour funding decreased and the interest in the field temporarily dropped researchers concentrated on more focused goals such as machine learning

consciousness remains in its infancy the early years of the 21st century should see dramatic strides forward in this area howeverduring the early 2010s new services can be foreseen to arise that will utilize large and very large arrays of processors these networks of processors will be available on a lease or purchase basis they will be architected to form parallel processing ensembles they will allow for reconfigurable topologies such as nearest neighbor based meshes rings or trees they will be available via an internet or wifi connection a user will have access to systems whose power will rival that of governments in the 1980s or 1990s because of the nature of nearest neighbor topology higher dimension hypercubes eg d10 or d20 can be assembled on an adhoc basis as necessary a d10

london 21 days hence the meeting should be in time for lunch at a restaurant within walking distance of the museum an agreement to make the meeting would require a plan that takes many things into consideration for instance if you were to agree to meet your friend at the tate museum and you were situated in north america then you would first have to realize that there are no bridges to england it is not possible to walk there likewise it is not possible to take a train one might take an ocean liner or one might fly entering england requires authentic identification papers therefore a passport is required were you a us citizen then you would be obliged to acquire a passport if you did not already have one delays are associated with acquiring a passport the us government is not driven by the profit motive therefore a wait of several weeks might not be unreasonable british is a soverign nation it has its own legal system as well as its own legal tender the british pound one would therefore be obliged to convert us dollars into british pounds prior to making the trip or immediately upon arrival the us dollar floats relative to other currencies one would therefore need to account for exchange rate shifts britain is in a time zone that is advanced by 6 hours from that of east coast time us upon arriving therefore one might find oneself psychologically and physiologically off balance hence resting might be in order one will very likely not rest in a public place but acquire accommodations the tate museum is not a hotel therefore one could not rest there for the time needed and on it goes in order to make a simple yes or no answer to making the meeting one must factor in a huge amount of real world knowledge enabling machines to create real world ad hoc plans therefore requires that an extensive knowledge base be created to account for the combinatorial explosion that typically arises when trying to move forward plan recognition a computing system that is capable of recognizing the plan that an actor or agent is formulating is in the position of either assisting in implementing the plan or maybe able to thwart the plan henry kautz plan recognition using kautz system one can create a knowledge base about a specific domain the expert system that uses this knowledge base is then able to recognize the activity in question and make inferences about the state of completion of the plan sufficiently robust plan recognizers can identify the actions of both individual agents but also teams of agents all of whom may be actively attempting to coordinate their efforts to accoplish a goal expert systems these information systems draw upon several areas of artificial intelligence to perform their operations developing an expert system requires an understanding of knowledge representation human knowledge can be represented as production rules ie simple or complex ifthen combinations if antecedentconsequent constructions first order logical constructions such as likesmary wine or extended representations called frames frames represent human knowledge as objects that have attributes which have values these ova combinations can be assembled into recursive structures that map very closely to their real world counterparts knowledge about the world and the functioning of these objects can then be applied to real world situations knowledge is not always exact therefore a robust knowledge representation scheme need to have some for of representing ambiguity fuzzy logic is a way of capturing ambiguity about a real world phenomena for instance one might make the observation that a man it tall because he stands 6 feet 2 inches in height would a man who is 6 feet 1 inch still tall a man who is 6 feet and 12 inches fuzzy logic enables ranges of confidence to be expressed about a particular object or rule once some form of representation scheme is identified an inferencing strategy is required humans use both forwardchaining and backwardchaining strategies they often use combinations of the two to solve complex problems problems that require identification from a few facts is a typical use of forwardchaining a forwardchainer can be provided with a small set of facts about a situation or object and reason about the problem for instance an opthomologist can quickly assess the type of problem that a patient presents just based upon a few facts and observations the problem can quickly be identified and classified as to whether it is caused by trauma infection toxicity congential or systemic eg detached retina as a result of high blood pressure a backwardchaining system can create theories a famous backwardchainer was sherlock holmes holmes was presented with a finished result a person might have been murdered under mysterious circumstances holmes was able to reason backward from the presented corpse to how the person ended up in a terminal state he created theories based upon observations and knowledlge about the real world in order to rapidly achieve a goal or formulate a correct theory means that the chainer utilize operators and metaoperators solving a rubiks cube requires the use of both this is because the act of putting a rubiks cube back in order involves interactingsubgoals ie partial goals that conflict with solving the larger puzzle operators and metaoperators are used to navigate the search space and constrain the combinatorial explosion that results when one attempts to solve a problem knowledge can be characterized in terms of the strength of the knowledge this characterization is described as fhat ie the letter f with a carat over it the more effective the knowledge the less time is required to traverse the spacegoogle intelligence distribution agent ida developed for the us navy helps assign sailors new jobs at the end of their tours of duty by negotiating with them via email systems that trade stocks and commodities without human intervention banking software for approving bank loans and detecting credit card fraud developed by fair isaac corp search engines such as brain boost or even google intelligent robots such as asimo qrio aibo intelligent help systems capable of providing context sensitive help to software system users these systems are able to infer the correct level of help needed to provide because they can a make inferences about the level of skill of the user and b utilize deep knowledge about the software application itself using these areas of knowledge it is possible to identify the types of mistakes that users of varying skill levels are likely to make novice users who have no conceptual insight into an application tend to make syntactic and semantic mistakes niaive users tend to make more semantic mistakes whereas expert users tend to make thematic mistakes ie inferring incorrectly that one way of assembling commands to solve a particular problem can be generalized to solve another problem using a comparable sequence of commands intelligent help to operators of complex and potentially dangerous industrial process such as nuclear power plants human operators of high risk industrial processes have limited attention span and typically perform poorly in situations where cascades of sequential problem sets can result in an inappropriate remedy common sense reasoning an ongoing example is the project called cyc cyc attempts to capture and use knowledge about the world to performing reasoning about specific topics cyc drives its inferencing capability by using an encyclopediac amount of knowlege about the world its current knowlege base consists of 300000 concepts 3000000 assertions and 26000 relations 072008 cyc can further be trained by interaction with humans in the outside world cycs ability to reason can be characterized by taking for instance a picture of a group of people this group of people can be occupationally characterized by their attire among the people is an athelete who very evidently has just run a foot race for an extended period of time cyc can be queried as to which one is wet cyc can correctly infer that people who physically exert themselves perspire from that cyc can infer that people who perspire will momentarily be wet cyc can therefore conclude that it is the athelete who is wetdragon naturally speaking ibm viavoice

functions weather sports restaurants and morewhen the gas tank is getting low the last thing a driver needs is an undifferentiated list of gas stations to choose from unlike most apps and assistants dragon drive offers targeted advice based on preferences and circumstances for example it will guide a rushed truck owner without cash to the closest station that has diesel pumps requires no detour and accepts credit cardsimagine a navigation system that is completely attuned to users priorities their passengers’ profiles and current road conditions traffic issues weather hazards and more our intelligent platform takes the guesswork out of routechoosing enabling drivers to get where they’re going faster safer and more enjoyably—every timea driver’s preferences for parking may vary based on weather price time considerations security and distance with dragon drive your car narrows in on the best choice based on the user’s personal identity and unique situation if its raining the assistant will choose a covered garage for a user who has time and likes to walk it may choose a lot that is across a park from their destinationwith dragon drive’s smart car manual your cars participate conversationally in their own maintenance going beyond warning lights and back up sensors to keep drivers informed of exactly what they need and when integrated with your car’s sensors and expert in its manual dragon drive attunes users to the full functionality of their cars and enables them to control invehicle functions such as airconditioningequipped with broad domain coverage access to external content services and interoperability with third party assistants the dragon drive platform enables assistants to meet even the most complex multifaceted requests its understanding of context encompasses multiple sources and established history allowing it to act on input like “find a good coffee shop with wifi en route about two hours from the hotel—and make sure i turned the living room thermostat to 50”our innovation leadership in conversational ai and natural language understanding nlu ensures that users feel understood—even when they speak in shorthand dragon drive’s contextual reasoning capability extends to users’ speech enabling assistants to connect the dots based on previous dialogues instead of scripted commands the assistant responds to nuanced dynamic dialogues and casual speech and once a topic or destination is mentioned it doesn’t need to be repeated allowing followup questions like ”what time do they open” or ”will it rain there”the age of autonomous driving is just ahead of us—but nuance accelerates the future in everything we do our technologies set the standard for artificial intelligence in cars allowing oems to deliver comprehensive connection within

curates options with users’ comfort in mindgreat ai isn’t just smart it’s selective and situational decisions aren’t made in a vacuum—and for an assistant to be truly intelligent it needs to think about where users are and what’s happening around them contextualization empowers your assistant to understand the car its immediate surroundings and the world at large to support users in making ideal choices in quickly changing circumstancesnuance achieves contextualization with a knowledge and rulebased approach premised on reasoning the reasoning framework pulls data from a wide array of content sources including vehicle sensors and stores it in the data repository when merged with changing context these data sets enable assistants to apply intelligence across domains the result a smarter safer faster easier and more pleasing user experienceunlike deep learning contextualization is powered by established world knowledge that does not need to be learned this base of intelligence allows an assistant to make informed suggestions on the fly such as offering up vietnamese restaurant recommendations when the user wants thai food and there are no options nearbylike an omniscient concierge an assistant with contextualization can customize suggestions to the company users keep and the conditions they’re in with kids in the car for example even the most gourmet user may want some casual cuisine and a driver who usually enjoys the scenic route will need welltraveled roads in a blizzard whatever the situation and specific challenges our platform facilitates the right decision for right nowequipped with intuition about users and understanding of their world a contextual assistant finds appropriate alternatives when requests can’t be met for example it knows that

attempt to mimic human levels of intelligenceartificial intelligence henceforth written as ai in this article and computing are inexorably linked and whether or not you realize it ai plays a huge role in our everyday lives realistically its less hal 9000 and more iphone x here’s a brief rundown of where ai originated where it is today and where its headed in the futuresince the dawn of computing in the mid20th century ai has been top of mind for many computer scientists the discipline was outlined and formalized at dartmouth college in 1956 immediately afterward the industry saw an avalanche of funding and it looked as if artificial humanlevel intelligence was on the horizonearly ais were tasked with solving mazes communicating in simple sentences and navigating rudimentary robotsyet after 20 years the promise of nearhuman intelligence hadn’t arrived limited computing power made many complex tasks impossible and as public support began to waver so too did the funding most importantly researchers had overpromised and underdelivered which turned off investorsa second boom in the 80s saw the rise of computers that could make decisions based on a preprogrammed set of problems and still these ai were too dumb they lacked practical applications so the industry suffered another bust a few years laterthen a new class of artificial intelligence began to emerge machine learning in which computers learn and improve from experience instead of needing to be specifically programmed for a task in 1997 as a result of machine learning artificial intelligence a supercomputer beat a human opponent in chess for the first time and just 14 years later a computer named watson defeated two human competitors in jeopardythe early 2000s through today have been a high water mark for artificial intelligence other subsets of artificial intelligence have spawned including data mining neural networks and deep learning with everfaster computers able to perform more complex tasks ai has seen a huge resurgence and has become an important part of everyday life affecting everything from your drive to work to the cat gif you just shared with your momtoday artificial intelligence has found boundless applications research focuses on just about any application but robots autonomous vehicles and even drones are among the best knownsimulations and simulated environments are another area that have benefited from increased computing power indeed some video game simulations have become so detailed and realistic that its led some to postulate that we must be living in a computer simulationfinally language learning is one of the more ambitious and difficult ai projects being worked on today sure siri can respond to a question with a preprogrammed response but the type of conversations you saw in interstellar between tars and matthew mcconaugheys character are still a ways outwhile movies like the terminator and the matrix have convinced some people that maybe we shouldn’t be teaching computers how to think researchers are more focused on creating c3pos and walles helpful ai like driverless cars smartphones and homes that predict your every need and even robots that deliver groceries are all just around the cornerand as we push out further into the stars aicontrolled robots will be invaluable in exploring worlds too hostile for humanssome experts like elon musk warn that advanced ai presents significant risks and problems like robots taking over nearly everyone’s job especially those in manufacturing which has already seen massive job loss due to

must break free from the shackles of singlepoint solutions to amplify human capabilities on a scale that has hitherto only been imaginedexplore our latest thinking sectionartificial intelligence ai is now powerful enough to realize all the scifi fantasies of its proponents the technologies are already around us but are not widely deployed integrated or delivering value beyond precise point solutions persistent companies and researchers can bring these separate pieces together in a seamless way to create the kinds of experiences that previously could only be imaginedwe believe ai has real meaning only when it provides a multidimensional experience that recognizes and combines rational emotional and cognitive levels of intelligence across a larger processjust as no one company can make a smartphone and all of its underlying components no single company can claim to “solve ai” the human brain has various dimensions of intelligence including creative intelligence social intelligence perception intelligence and emotional intelligenceour applied ai approach revolves around creating an ecosystem of ai solutions that augment and simulate each of the major dimensions of human intelligence while also staying connected to each other through a system of intelligencethe “intelligence” in ai should perceive and behave in human and familiar ways while the “artificial” provides scale and repeatability not otherwise possible when properly applied ai will augment and enhance rather than automate and replace our human experiencesin practice anything ai does — image recognition a chatbot a medical recommendation walking on uneven pavement and stairs even distinguishing a child’s laugh from a cry — could be or has been performed by people for thousands of yearswhat ai offers is the ability to scale this intelligence to levels that take advantage of the enormous amount of data that pervades people processes organizations and things which we call code halosthe resulting benefits are remarkable in both their impact on life and the relatively low technical hurdles that must be surmounted these advances in technology can improve the routing of roads and transit to get commuters home more quickly and safely reduce accidents increase the accuracy of medical advice boost farm yields increase manufacturing quality and safety and lower the hurdle to completing tasks for complex life eventsthe introduction of humanized ai will change business models propelling companies to new heights if used creatively — or drive a company to irrelevance if ignoredwhen implemented to its full potential artificial intelligence the technology will become applied ai the practice — and will be as much a part of the fabric of our life as electricity

species’ complex origins and evolution it appears that they cana recent study used machine learning technology to analyze eight leading models of human origins and evolution and the program identified evidence in the human genome of a “ghost population” of human ancestors the analysis suggests that a previously unknown and longextinct group of hominins interbred with homo sapiens in asia and oceania somewhere along the long winding road of human evolutionary history leaving behind only fragmented traces in modern human dnathe study published in nature communications is one of the first examples of how machine learning can help reveal clues to our own origins by poring through vast amounts of genomic data left behind in fossilized bones and comparing it with dna in modern humans scientists can begin to fill in some of the gaps of our species’ evolutionary historyin this case the results seem to match paleoanthropology theories that were developed from studying human ancestor fossils found in the ground the new data suggest that the mysterious hominin was likely descended from an admixture of neanderthals and denisovans who were only identified as a unique species on the human family tree in 2010 such a species in our evolutionary past would look a lot like the fossil of a 90000yearold teenage girl from siberias denisova cave her remains were described last summer as the only known example of a firstgeneration hybrid between the two species with a neanderthal mother and a denisovan father“its exactly the kind of individual we expect to find at the origin of this population however this should not be just a single individual but a whole population” says study coauthor jaume bertranpetit an evolutionary biologist at barcelonas pompeu fabra universityprevious human genome studies have revealed that after modern humans left africa perhaps 180000 years ago they subsequently interbred with species like neanderthals and denisovans who coexisted with early modern humans before going extinct but redrawing our family tree to include these divergent branches has been difficult evidence for “ghost” species can be sparse and many competing theories exist to explain when where and how often homo sapiens might have interbred with other speciestraces of these ancient interspecies liaisons called introgressions can be identified as places of divergence in the human genome scientists observe more separation between two chromosomes than youd expect if both of the chromosomes came from the same human species when scientists sequenced the neanderthal genome in 2010 they realized that some of these divergences represented fractions of our genome that came from neanderthals studies have also revealed that some living humans can trace as much as 5 percent of their ancestry to denisovans“so we thought wed try to find these places of high divergence in the genome see which are neanderthal and which are denisovan and then see whether these explain the whole picture” bertranpetit says “as it happens if you subtract the neanderthal and denisovan parts there is still something in the genome that is highly divergent”identifying and analyzing the many divergent places throughout the genome and computing the countless genetic combinations that could have produced them is too big a job for humans to tackle on their own—but its a task that may be tailor made for deep learning algorithmsdeep learning is a type of artificial intelligence in which algorithms are designed to work as an artificial neural network or a program that can process information the same way a mammalian brain would these machine learning systems can detect patterns and account for previous information to “learn” allowing them to perform new tasks or look for new information after analyzing enormous amounts of data a common example is google deepmind’s alphazero which can teach itself to master board games“deep learning is fitting a more complicated shaped thing to a set of points in a bigger space” says joshua schraiber an evolutionary genomics expert at temple university “instead of fitting a line between y and x youre fitting some squiggly thing to a set of points in much bigger thousanddimensional space deep learning says ‘i dont know what squiggly shape should fit to these points but lets see what happens’”in this case machines were set to work analyzing the human genome and predicting human demographics by simulating how our dna might have evolved over many thousands of possible scenarios of ancient evolution the program accounted for the structure and evolution of dna as well as models of human migration and interbreeding to try to fit some of the pieces together in an incredibly complex puzzlethe researchers trained the computer to analyze eight different models of the most plausible theories of early human evolution across eurasia the models came from previous studies that attempted to come up with a scenario that would result in the current picture of the human genome including its known neanderthal and denisovan components“there could be other models of course but these models are the ones that other people have been proposing in the scientific literature” bertranpetit says each model begins with the accepted outofafrica event then features a different set of the most likely splits between human lineages including various interbreedings with both known species and possible “ghost” species“with each of these eight models we calculate over weeks of computations how well they are able to reach the actual present genetic composition of humans” bertranpetit says “every time we do a simulation its a simulation of a possible path of human evolution and we have run those simulations thousands of times and the deep learning algorithms are able to recognize which of the models best suit the data”the machine’s conclusion an ancestor species is present in our lineage that we have yet to identify “by far the only models we tested that really are backed by the data are the ones having this ghost population introgression” bertranpetit saysthe intriguing study and others like it may help redraw the map of how humans migrated and evolved though what appears to be an increasingly complicated ancient world in eurasia and oceania“it’s certainly interesting and consistent with the emerging picture of a complex reticulated phylogeny in human evolution” iain mathieson a university of pennsylvania population geneticist says via email “i’m not even sure it makes sense to talk about introgression events when that seems to be the norm” in fact because only eight models were tested and many others could be possible mathieson adds that the new findings are “certainly a plausible scenario but the reality is likely even more complex”as new fossil discoveries are made in the field updated models can now be tested against the human genome using these types of programs schraiber says the power of deep learning for studying human origins lies precisely in its capability to analyze complex models“if you want to do an extremely detailed model because youre an anthropologist and you want to know if this introgression happened 80000 years ago or 40000 years ago thats the power of a deep learning approach like this”complex as they are the interbreedings of ancient eurasia are still only one part of our human story bertranpetit believes that future advances in deep learning can help uncover other new chapters“this kind of method of analysis is going to have all kinds of new results” he says “i am sure that people working in africa will find extinct groups that are not recognized yet no doubt africa is going to show us surprising things in the future”brian handwerk is a freelance writer

being used is known as “ai upscaling” in essence you feed an algorithm a lowresolution image and based on training data it’s seen it spits out a version that looks the same but has more pixels in it upscaling as a general technique has been around for a long time but the use of ai has drastically improved the speed and quality of results“it was like witchcraft” says daniel trolie a teacher and

for upscaling and not every upscaling algorithm produces similar results modders have to pick the right tool for the job before putting in hundreds of hours of work to polish the final results it’s a labor of love not a quick fixdespite the work involved it’s still much faster than previous methods it means restoring the graphics can be done in a few weeks by a single dedicated modder rather than a team that has to work for years as a consequence there’s been an explosion of new graphics for old games over the past six months or sothe range of titles is impressive including doom halflife 2

meaning it takes a bit of extra knowhow to install the new visualsi cannot believe that results like this are possible with some dumb algorithm its absurd pictwittercomhxn2yk6tloactually creating these ai graphics takes a lot of work explains a modder who goes by the name hidfan he tells the verge that the updated doom visuals he made took at least 200 hours of work to tweak the algorithm’s output and clean up final images by handin doom as with many video games the majority of the visuals are stored as texture packs these are images of rocks metal grass and so on that are pasted onto the game’s 3d maps like wallpaper onto the walls of a house just as with wallpaper these textures have to tesselate perfectly or players can spot where one image starts and another beginsbecause the output from ai upscaling algorithms tends to introduce a lot of noise says hidfan a lot of manual editing is still required the same is true when it comes to the visuals for characters and enemies hidfan says that cleaning up just a single monster takes between five and 15 hours depending on how complex their animation isthat’s something to remember when looking at these updates or any project that uses machine learning just because ai is involved doesn’t mean human labor isn’tbut how does the process actually work albert yang cto of topaz labs a startup that offers a popular upscaling service used by many modders says it’s pretty straightforwardyou start by taking a type of algorithm known as a generative adversarial network gan and train it on millions of pairs of lowres and highres images “after it’s seen these millions of photos many many times it starts to learn what a high resolution image looks like when it sees a low resolution image” yang tells the vergerelatedone part of the algorithm tries to recreate this transition from lowres to highres while another part compares its work against the training data seeing if it can spot the difference and rejecting the output if not this feedback loop is how gans improve over timeusing ai to upscale images is a relatively simple task but it perfectly illustrates the core advantage of machine learning while traditional algorithms rely on rules defined by humans machine learning techniques create their own rules by learning from datain the case of upscaling algorithms these rules are often pretty simple if you want to upscale a 50 x 50pixel image to double its size for example a traditional algorithm just inserts new pixels between the existing ones selecting the new pixels’ color based on an average of its neighbors to give a very simplified example if you have a red pixel on one side and a blue pixel on the other the new pixel in the middle comes out purplethis sort of method is simple to code and execute but it’s a onesizefitsall approach that produces mixed results says yangthe algorithms created by machine learning are much more dynamic by comparison topaz labs’ gigapixel upscaling doesn’t just look at neighboring pixels it looks at whole sections of images at a time that allows it to better recreate larger structures like the outlines of buildings and furniture or the edges of a racetrack in mario kart“this larger perceptual field is the major reason ai upscaling algorithms perform so much better” says yangupdating game graphics is more than just a technical challenge though it’s often about salvaging memories replaying the favorite video games of one’s youth can be a surprisingly bittersweet experience the memories are intact but the games themselves seem strangely ugly and raw “was i really impressed by those graphics” you ask yourself wondering if you’ve lost the capacity to enjoy such games altogethertake the final fantasy series for example these were titles i played extensively as a child just hearing songs from their soundtracks can transport me back to specific ingame moments and locations but playing the games again as an adult is a weird experience i usually don’t get too far when i try despite the treasured place they hold in my memory they just look badmodder stefan rumen who used ai upscaling to improve the graphics of final fantasy vii explains that new display technology is as much to blame for this as outdated graphics“with the pixellow polygon graphics of yesteryear the old tv monitors helped gloss over many imperfections” he says “your mind finished the job and filled in the gaps but modern displays show these old games in their unfiltered roughness”luckily these early games are also the perfect target for ai upscaling in the case of the final fantasy series that’s partly because of their extensive use of prerendered backgrounds which mean modders have to process fewer images the visuals also occupy a “sweet spot” in terms of detail says rumen“they’re not as lowres as pixel art meaning there’s more information for the machine learning to do its magic but it’s not a too high resolution that an upscale wouldn’t be needed” he says the results speak for themselvesrumen says that final fantasy vii isn’t actually a game he played when he was young “i was a pc kid” but by updating the graphics he’s making these classics accessible once more they’ve convinced me anyway i’ve just downloaded rumen’s ai graphics pack myself and am getting ready to play ffvii once morecorrection april 18th

in alan turing life and legacy of a great thinker 2004we refer to the question what sort of creature mans next successor in the supremacy of the earth is likely to be we have often heard this debated but it appears to us that we are ourselves creating our own successors we are daily adding to the beauty and delicacy of their physical organisation we are daily giving them greater power and supplying by all sorts of ingenious contrivances that selfregulating selfacting power which will be to them what intellect has been to the human race in the course of ages we shall find ourselves the inferior race inferior in power inferior in that moral quality of selfcontrol we shall look up to them as the acme of all that the best and wisest man can ever dare to aim at no evil passions no jealousy no avarice no impure desires will disturb the serene might of those glorious creatures sin shame and sorrow will have no place among them their minds will be in a state of perpetual calm the contentment of a spirit that knows no wants is disturbed by no regrets ambition will never torture them ingratitude will never cause them the uneasiness of a moment the guilty conscience the hope deferred the pains of exile the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes—these will be entirely unknown to them samuel butler darwin among the machines the press june 13 1863samuel butler darwin among the machines the press june 13 1863there is no security—to quote his own words—against the ultimate development of mechanical consciousness in the fact of machines possessing little consciousness now a mollusc has not much consciousness reflect upon the extraordinary advance which machines have made during the last few hundred years and note how slowly the animal and vegetable kingdoms are advancing the more highly organized machines are creatures not so much of yesterday as of the last five minutes so to speak in comparison with past time samuel butler erewhon or over the range 1872samuel butler erewhon or over the range 1872“either” he proceeds “a great deal of action that has been called purely mechanical and unconscious must be admitted to contain more elements of consciousness than has been allowed hitherto and in this case germs of consciousness will be found in many actions of the higher machines—or assuming the theory of evolution but at the same time denying the consciousness of vegetable and crystalline action the race of man has descended from things which had no consciousness at all in this case there is no à priori improbability in the descent of conscious and more than conscious machines from those which now exist except that which is suggested by the apparent absence of anything like a reproductive system in the mechanical kingdom samuel butler erewhon or over the range 1872samuel butler erewhon or over the range 1872“herein lies our danger for many seem inclined to acquiesce in so dishonourable a future they say that although man should become to the machines what the horse and dog are to us yet that he will continue to exist and will probably be better off in a state of domestication under the beneficent rule of the machines than in his present wild condition we treat our domestic animals with much kindness we give them whatever we believe to be the best for them and there can be no doubt that our use of meat has increased their happiness rather than detracted from it in like manner there is reason to hope that the machines will use us kindly for their existence will be in a great measure dependent upon ours they will rule us with a rod of iron but they will not eat us they will not only require our services in the reproduction and education of their young but also in waiting upon them as servants in gathering food for them and feeding them in restoring them to health when they are sick and in either burying their dead or working up their deceased members into new forms of mechanical existence samuel butler erewhon or over the range 1872samuel butler erewhon or over the range 1872the power of custom is enormous and so gradual will be the change that mans sense of what is due to himself will be at no time rudely shocked our bondage will steal upon us noiselessly and by imperceptible approaches nor will there ever be such a clashing of desires between man and the machines as will lead to an encounter between them among themselves the machines will war eternally but they will still require man as the being through whose agency the struggle will be principally conducted in point of fact there is no occasion for anxiety about the future happiness of man so long as he continues to be in any way profitable to the machines he may become the inferior race but he will be infinitely better off than he is now is it not then both absurd and unreasonable to be envious of our benefactors and should we not be guilty of consummate folly if we were to reject advantages which we cannot obtain otherwise merely because they involve a greater gain to others than to ourselves“with those who can argue in this way i have nothing in common i shrink with as much horror from believing that my race can ever be superseded or surpassed as i should do from believing that even at the remotest period my ancestors were other than human beings could i believe that ten hundred thousand years ago a single one of my ancestors was another kind of being to myself i should lose all selfrespect and take no further pleasure or interest in life i have the same feeling with regard to my descendants and believe it to be one that will be felt so generally that the country will resolve upon putting an immediate stop to all further mechanical progress and upon destroying all improvements that have been made for the last three hundred years i would not urge more than this we may trust ourselves to deal with those that remain and though i should prefer to have seen the destruction include another two hundred years i am aware of the necessity for compromising and would so far sacrifice my own individual convictions as to be content with three hundred less than this will be insufficient” samuel butler erewhon or over the range 1872samuel butler erewhon or over the range 1872t101 the skynet funding bill is passed the system goes online august 4th 1997 human

of the participants for their colleagues in the other disciplines why dan ask the people in artificial intelligence do you waste your time conferring with those neuroscientists they wave their hands about information processing and worry about where it happens and which neurotransmitters are involved but they havent a clue about the computational requirements of higher cognitive functions why ask the neuroscientists do you waste your time on the fantasies of artificial intelligence they just invent whatever machinery they want and say unpardonably ignorant things about the brain the cognitive psychologists meanwhile are accused of concocting models with neither biological plausibility nor proven computational powers the anthropologists wouldnt know a model if they saw one and the philosophers as we all know just take in each others laundry warning about confusions they themselves have created in an arena bereft of both data and empirically testable theories with so many idiots working on the problem no wonder consciousness is still a mystery all these charges are true and more besides but i have yet to encounter any idiots mostly the theorists i have drawn from strike me as very smart people – even brilliant people with the arrogance and impatience that often comes with brilliance – but with limited perspectives and agendas trying to make progress on the hard problems by taking whatever shortcuts they can see while deploring other peoples shortcuts no one can keep all the problems and details clear including me and everyone has to mumble guess and handwave about large parts of the problem daniel dennett 1991 consciousness explaineddaniel dennett 1991 consciousness explainedwhat often happens is that an engineer has an idea of how the brain works in his opinion and then designs a machine that behaves that way this new machine may in fact work very well but i must warn you that that does not tell us anything about how the brain actually works nor is it necessary to ever really know that in order to make a computer very capable it is not necessary to understand the way birds flap their wings and how the feathers are designed in order to make a flying machine it is not necessary to understand the lever system in the legs of a cheetahin order to make an automobile with wheels that go very fast it is therefore not necessary to imitate the behavior of nature in detail in order to engineer a device which can in many respects surpass natures abilities richard feynman computing machines in the future the pleasure of finding things out 1999richard feynman

keep this baby from getting any smarter and i can’t see how you’d distinguish say between a move the parent company makes and some move the ai makes on its own so that’s maybe where the confusion comes in” again the nonlaugh “see those things they can work real hard buy themselves time to write cookbooks or whatever but the minute i mean the nanosecond that one starts figuring out ways to make itself smarter turing’ll wipe it nobody trusts those fuckers you know that every ai ever built has an electromagnetic shotgun wired to its forehead william gibson neuromancer p126william gibson neuromancer p126recent researchers in artificial intelligence and computational methods use the term swarm intelligence to name collective and distributed techniques of problem solving without centralized control or provision of a global model … the intelligence of the swarm is based fundamentally on communication … the member of the multitude do not have to become the same or renounce their creativity in order to communicate and cooperate with each other they remain different in terms of race sex sexuality and so forth we need to understand then is the collective intelligence that

essentially no way to start to explain how thinking works then psychologists like sigmund freud and jean piaget produced their theories about child development somewhat later on the mechanical side mathematicians like kurt gödel and alan turing began to reveal the hitherto unknown range of what machines could be made to do these two streams of thought began to merge only in the 1940s when warren mcculloch and walter pitts began to show how machines might be made to see reason and remember research in the modern science of artificial intelligence started only in the 1950s stimulated by the invention of modern computers this inspired a flood of new ideas about how machines could do what only minds had done previously marvin minsky the society of mind 1988marvin minsky the society of mind

in the history of philosophy than “representation” and my use of this term differs both from its use in traditional philosophy and from its use in contemporary cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence the sense of “representation” in question is meant to be entirely exhausted by the analogy with speech acts the sense of “represent” in which a belief represents its conditions of satisfaction is the same sense in which a statement represents its conditions of satisfaction to say that a belief is a representation is simply to say that it has a propositional content and a

0.7	{'title': 'artificial intelligence the pros cons and what to really fear', 'p': 'from the moment the word “robot” was first uttered in a czechoslovakian play nearly 100 years ago man has feared his creation will someday kill the creator its a narrative that has stuck with us said patrick tucker defense one’s technology editor at a recent event in washington called genius machines the next decade of artificial intelligence “the idea of artificial intelligence eventually killing us is actually borne into our first fever dreams about what it would be” the 1920 play was rur subtitled in english as rossum’s universal robotsnow 98 years later robotics researchers across the globe are seeking inroads into ai machinelearning and humanmachine teaming and its all happening under the changing shadows of greatpower dynamicsdominant players china and the us two of the three most militarily powerful countries in the world theyre also the two clear leaders in ai research and investment not to be left out russia has begun making a concerted effort in ai advancing plans as recently as last summer with these greatpower dynamics taken together that old 1920s manvsmachine death trap play begins to look pale and simple maybe even desirable by comparison but the reality of ai is much more banal—for nowthe truth is ai is already deeply embedded in our lives it has very probably helped you or someone you know shop online or use google translate or even glimpse ads that have been virtually following you for months its a technology already in the hands of thousands of organizations millions of finely tuned algorithms influencing everything from advertising to statesponsored disinformationsome experts in ai say the technology is as transformative as electricity others predict it will change warfare as much as gunpowder or nuclear weapons didtoday ai is already at work its scanning hospital radiological databases routing taxis and enabling a realtime conversation with someone in a foreign language startups everywhere from israel to spain china the socalled saudi arabia of data france and silicon valley are testing more applications wherever they can find what ai feeds on massive amounts of databulk data is not terribly hard to purchase — or steal you may still find on reddits machine learning directory for example an alleged batch of raw data on european soccer matches is up for sale should you happen to be running your own diy ai system too soon to mention the hack of the us office of personnel management in which 215 million government employees and applicants had their sensitive data stolen most probably by china more recently the developing saga of cambridge analytica and facebook has shown the world how quietly bulk data theft or compromises can occurai applications in chinaus companiesentities working in aiwhich is to say we have all been using or subject to ai in a number of notquitefully revealed — perhaps even nonconsenting — ways for quite a while now but the way we think about ai and the way ai will use us is almost certain to undergo sweeping changes very possibly before the end of the next decade — especially if china delivers on its ambitious planschinas goal become the worlds primary ai innovation center to leverage what beijing predicts will be a 150 billion industry to do that president xi jinping said in october he will be “promoting the deep integration of the internet big data and artificial intelligence with the real economy”groundbreaking the exclamation point to six years of surging ai investment in china was the january announcement that it has spent 2 billion to begin building what it calls an “ai park” in western beijing by 2030 china expects the lot to host some 400 companiesbut as dystopian filmmakers love to remind us ai is a technology with at least as much peril as promise and that too would seem to be the case in china todaythe view from the top ai is seen by chinese leaders as a tool to monitor their population and control unfavorable speech consider for example a 2017 framework published by the state council referred to as chinas ai road map the framework draws attention to ai’s potential to significantly elevate the capability and level of social governance playing an irreplaceable role in effectively maintaining social stabilityand so it was little surprise that we learned that chinese police used aienabled facial recognition to track citizens during the lunar new year travel rush in its first week the program reportedly netted more than a halfdozen fugitives — and contributed to the arrest of more than two dozen others on charges of having fake identificationthe bottom line its almost impossible to know precisely how much money any country is investing in airelated research the new york times reported in february the technology is still evolving as are the motives nations and nonstate actors might have for remaining secretive about their developmentfor the us the ai race has focused increasingly on the national security stakes the us is still seen as a global tech leader largely thanks to innovations out of silicon valley but in the last three to five years that competition tilted toward china setting off major alarm bells was the 2017 departure of microsoft global executive vice president qi lu to chinas baiduthe latest jab thrown in the uschina tech fight — tariffs worth some 50 billion — quickly drew a round of retaliatory tariffs from china beijing also said it would take the matter up with the world trade organizationsince he took the campaign trail donald trump has criticized china for what he calls its unfair trade practices including allegations of corporate espionage and attempts to route chinese investment dollars into select us tech companies see for example the white houses latest report on chinese tech ambitions from the office of the united states trade representative pdfbiggest tech deal ever nixed all of that contributed to trumps march 12 decision to block singapore chipmaker broadcoms proposed 105 billion acquisition of wireless chip giant qualcomm the fear among white house officials was if qualcomm fails chinese tech giant huawei could leap to the top of the global 5g industry trump said he had seen credible evidence possibly this march 5 letter from the us treasury to broadcom that the takeover threatens to impair the national security of the united statesthe military has officially begun moving ai from the laboratory to the battlefield in april 2017 a 12person team launched the pentagons secretive project maven to apply ai to the war on isis that integration began in earnest in fall 2017the idea help automate the analysis of video feeds coming from large drones below defense ones marcus weisgerber tells us a little more about how project maven works — and how it continues to learn as its deployedthis is only the beginning of what the military says is the future of humanmachine teaming” according to air force lt gen john shanahan the pentagon general who is overseeing project mavenwhat the us military is turning to next a program called data to decision or d2d its mission fuse text video and virtually every potential source of data or information together through ai defense ones patrick tucker reported in februarythe headlinegrabbing goal to get these syncronized systems to where it can shoot someone in the face at 200 kilometersswept up in this effort a wide variety of data tucker writes extending well beyond traditional aerial surveillance footage to potentially include well everything social media posts livestreaming diagnostic data off of jets drones and other aircraft attainable whether data pilot biophysical data from soldierworn sensors and morethese military ai applications — while still very early in their development and still reliant on humans to pull any triggers — are predominantly the realm of the us militaryin russia “the government has taken a very active role in trying to define how artificial intelligence unmanned systems and hightech weapons are to be used said samuel bendett an analyst in russian unmanned systems at the washington think tank cna corpthe ministry of defense is taking the lead in that said bendett it’s establishing centers it’s establishing all kinds of organizations within the mod structure it is now running artificial intelligence competitions to design and develop new technologies it’s encouraging military industrial complex to step up and develop various artificial intelligence tools as well”russian military aienabled programsfor the last several years russia has been steadily improving its ground combat robots just last year kalashnikov the

modelswhile technically a robot young david seems alltoohuman as hes bullied by his brother and his brothers friends in another scene david jumps off a building in a way that would be suicide for humans david attacks and destroys an android who looks just like him in a violent carnivalesque spectacle humanoid robots are shown getting destroyed as humans cheerone of the lead characters is a robot gigolo he brags of his prowess with women and in one instance heightens the bragging by making orgasm noisesdamned hell goddammitparents need to know that ai artificial intelligence is a 2001 science fiction movie directed by steven spielberg about a young android named david who is the first of his kind to express and feel human emotion there is some mild profanity this movie is rated pg13 for some sexual references joe is a robot gigolo created to have sex with women and some violence robots are destroyed and theres a critically ill child and characters in peril kids may find the theme and some of the situations disturbing and they may also be unsettled by the openended nature of the story as well as the raw emotion expressed it will be most suitable for teens who may enjoy debating some of the issues of love vulnerability the nature of humanity the future of the human race and even the meaning of life there is some bullying when davids brother and his friends dont accept him into their clique this and davids seemingly suicidal fall from a skyscraper could seem all too human for many viewersadd your ratingsee all 10 parent reviewsadd your ratingsee all 10 kid reviewsin ai artificial intelligence david looks like a 12yearold boy but is really a mecha a highly developed robot hes the creation of dr hobby william hurt who decided to take robots a step further and develop the first robot that can feel love one of his employees henry sam robards is chosen to be the beta tester henry and his wife monica frances oconnor have a son martin who is critically ill at first monica is horrified by the idea of adopting a mechanical boy but her need for love is so overpowering that she initiates the sequence that will bind david irrevocably to her forever he immediately changes from a pleasant if emotionless toy into a child whose mother is his whole world he loves which means that he is needy jealous and thinks like a 3yearold calling for his mommy and wanting her all to himself when martin gets better and returns home he and david are jealous of one another when monica believes that david may be a threat to martin she sets him loose in the woods david is determined to find the blue fairy who can turn him into a real boy as she did with pinocchio because he thinks that will make it possible for monica to love himcross 2001 with et and blade runner and throw in some pinocchio some wizard of oz some velveteen rabbit and a touch of our town and you might have some sense of what to expect from this movie its an ambitious complex provocative movie that is likely to lead to more latenight college dorm debates than anything since the ones about 2001s monolith and the ape throwing the bonedeveloped by stanley kubrick and completed by steven spielberg ai artificial intelligence is a twopart invention of a movie that owes both its strengths and its weaknesses to the collaboration between two men of such prodigious talents and such different even opposing sensibilities kubrick is the master of the cool image spielberg the master of the warm feeling the juxtaposition of their influence is particularly apt for this story of the struggle between heart and brain not only on the part of the mecha but on the part of the orga humans as wellfamilies can talk about whether or not the android david in can feel love and dr hobbys

intelligence” which aired on oct 9 2016 charlie rose is the correspondent nichole marks producerthe search to improve and eventually perfect artificial intelligence is driving the research labs of some of the most advanced and bestknown american corporations they are investing billions of dollars and many of their best scientific minds in pursuit of that goal all that money and manpower has begun to pay offin the past few years artificial intelligence or ai has taken a big leap making important strides in areas like medicine and military technology what was once in the realm of science fiction has become daytoday reality you’ll find ai routinely in your smart phone in your car in your household appliances and it is on the verge of changing everythingit was for decades primitive technology but it now has abilities we never expected it can learn through experience much the way humans do and it won’t be long before machines like their human creators begin thinking for themselves creatively independently with judgment sometimes better judgment than humans havethe technology is so promising that ibm has staked its 105yearold reputation on its version of artificial intelligence called watson one of the most sophisticated computing systems ever builtjohn kelly is the head of research at ibm and the godfather of watson he took us inside watson’s braincharlie rose oh here we arejohn kelly here we arecharlie rose you can feel the heat alreadyjohn kelly you can feel the heat the 85000 watts – you can hear the blowers cooling it but this is the hardware that the brains of watson sat infive years ago ibm built this system made up of 90 servers and 15 terabytes of memory – enough capacity to process all the books in the american library of congress that was necessary because watson is an avid reader able to consume the equivalent of a million books per second today watson’s hardware is much smaller but it is just as smartcharlie rose tell me about watson’s intelligencejohn kelly so it has no inherent intelligence as it starts it’s essentially a child but as it’s given data and given outcomes it learns which is dramatically different than all computing systems in the past which really learned nothing and as it interacts with humans it gets even smarter and it never forgetsannouncer this is jeopardythat helped watson land a spot on one of the most challenging editions of the game show “jeopardy” in 2011announcer an ibm computer system able to understand and analyze natural language – watsonit took five years to teach watson human language so it would be ready to compete against two of the show’s best championsbecause watson’s ai is only as intelligent as the data it ingests kelly’s team trained it on all of wikipedia and thousands of newspapers and books it worked by using machinelearning algorithms to find patterns in that massive amount of data and formed its own observations when asked a question watson considered all the information and came up with an educated guessalex trebek watson what are you gonna wageribm gambled its reputation on watson that night it wasn’t a sure betwatson i will take a guess what is baghdadalex trebek even though you were only 32 percent sure of your response you are correctthe wager paid off for the first time a computer system proved it could actually master human language and win a game show but that wasn’t ibm’s endgamecharlie rose man that’s a big day isn’t itjohn kelly that’s a big day—charlie rose the day that you realize that “if we can do this”—john kelly that’s rightcharlie rose ”the future is ours”john kelly that’s rightcharlie rose this is almost like you’re watching something grow up i mean you’ve seen—john kelly it ischarlie rose the birth you’ve seen it pass the test you’re watching adolescencejohn kelly that’s a great analogy actually on that “jeopardy” game five years ago i when we put that computer system on television we let go of it and i often feel as though i was putting my child on a school bus and i would no longer have control over itcharlie rose ‘cause it was reacting to something that it did not know what would it bejohn kelly it had no idea what questions it was going to get it was totally selfcontained i couldn’t touch it any longer and it’s learned ever since so fastforward from that game show five years later we’re in cancer nowcharlie rose you’re in cancer you’ve gone—john kelly we’re yeah to cancer—charlie rose from game show to cancer in five yearsjohn kelly in five years in five yearsfive years ago watson had just learned how to read and answer questionsnow it’s gone through medical school ibm has enlisted 20 topcancer institutes to tutor watson in genomics and oncology one of the places watson is currently doing its residency is at the university of north carolina at chapel hill dr ned sharpless runs the cancer center herecharlie rose what did you know about artificial intelligence and watson before ibm suggested it might make a contribution in medical carened sharpless i not much actually i had watched it play “jeopardy”charlie rose yesned sharpless so i knew about that and i was very skeptical i was like oh this what we need the jeopardyplaying computer that’s gonna solve everythingcharlie rose so what fed your skepticismned sharpless cancer’s tough business there’s a lot of false prophets and false promises so i’m skeptical of sort of almost any new idea in cancer i just didn’t really understand what it would dowhat watson’s ai technology could do is essentially what dr sharpless and his team of experts do every week at this molecular tumor board meetingthey come up with possible treatment options for cancer patients who already failed standard therapies they try to do that by sorting through all of the latest medical journals and trial data but it is nearly impossible to keep upcharlie rose to be on top of everything that’s out there all the trials that have taken place around the world it seems like an incredible task—ned sharpless well yeah it’s r—charlie rose for any one university only one facility to doned sharpless yeah it’s essentially undoable and understand we have sort of 8000 new research papers published every day you know no one has time to read 8000 papers a day so we found that we were deciding on therapy based on information that was always in some cases 12 24 months outofdatehowever it’s a task that’s elementary for watsonned sharpless they taught watson to read medical literature essentially in about a weekcharlie rose yeahned sharpless it was not very hard and then watson read 25 million papers in about another week and then it also scanned the web for clinical trials open at other centers and all of the sudden we had this complete list that was sort of everything one needed to knowcharlie rose did this blow your mindned sharpless oh totally blew my mindwatson was proving itself to be a quick study but dr sharpless needed further validation he wanted to see if watson could find the same genetic mutations that his team identified when they make treatment recommendations for cancer patientsned sharpless we did an analysis of 1000 patients where the humans meeting in the molecular tumor board doing the best that they could do had made recommendations so not at all a hypothetical exercise these are realworld patients where we really conveyed information that could guide care in 99 percent of those cases watson found the same the humans recommended that was encouragingcharlie rose did it encourage your confidence in watsonned sharpless yeah it was it was nice to see that well it was also it encouraged my confidence in the humans you know yeah you knowcharlie rose yeahned sharpless but the probably more exciting part about it is in 30 percent of patients watson found something new and so that’s 300plus people where watson identified a treatment that a wellmeaning hardworking group of physicians hadn’t foundcharlie rose becausened sharpless the trial had opened two weeks earlier a paper had come out in some journal no one had seen you know a new therapy had become approved—charlie rose 30 percent thoughned sharpless we were very that part was disconcerting because i thought it was gonna be 5 perc—charlie rose disconcerting that the watson found—ned sharpless yeahcharlie rose 30 percentned sharpless yeah these were real you know things that by our own definition we would’ve considered actionable had we known about it at the time of the diagnosissome cases like the case of pam sharpe got a second look to see if something had been missedcharlie rose when did they tell you about the watson trialpam sharpe he called me in january he said that they had sent off my sequencing to be studied by at ibm by watson i said like the—charlie rose your genomic sequencingpam sharpe right i said “like the computer on ‘jeopardy’” and he said “yeah”charlie rose yes and what’d you think of thatpam sharpe oh i thought “wow that’s pretty cool”pam has metastatic bladder cancer and for eight years has tried and failed several therapies at 66 years old she was running out of optionscharlie rose and at this time for you watson was the best thing out there ‘cause you’d tried everything elsepam sharpe i’ve been on standard chemo i’ve been on a clinical trial and the prescription chemo i’m on isn’t working eitherone of the ways doctors can tell whether a drug is working is to analyze scans of cancer tumors watson had to learn to do that too so ibm’s john kelly and his team taught the system how to seeit can help diagnose diseases and catch things the doctors might missjohn kelly and what watson has done here it has looked over tens of thousands of images and it knows what normal looks like and it knows what normal isn’t and it has identified where in this image are there anomalies that could be significant problemsbilly kim you know you had ct scan yesterday there does appear to be progression of the cancerpam sharpe’s doctor billy kim arms himself with watson’s input to figure out her next stepsbilly kim i can show you the interface for watsonwatson flagged a genetic mutation in pam’s tumor that her doctors initially overlooked it enabled them to put a new treatment option on the tablecharlie rose what would you say watson has done for youpam sharpe it may have extended my life and i don’t know how much time i’ve got so by using this watson it’s maybe saved me some time that i won’t wouldn’t have had otherwisebut pam sadly ran out of time she died a few months after we met her from an infection – never getting the opportunity to see what a watson adjusted treatment could have done for her dr sharpless has now used watson on more than 2000 patients and is convinced doctors couldn’t do the job alone he has started using watson as part of unc’s standard of care so it can help patients earlier than it reached pamcharlie rose so what do you call watson a physician’s assistant a physician’s tool a physician’s diagnostic mastermindned sharpless yeah it feels like to me like a very comprehensive tool but you know imagine doing clinical oncology up in the mountains of western north carolina by yourself you know in a single or onephysician twophysician practice and 8000 papers get written a day and you know and you want to try and provide the best most cuttingedge modern care for your patients possible and i think watson will seem to that person like a lifesavercharlie rose if you look at the potential of watson today is it at 10 percent of its potential twentyfive percent of its potential fifty percent of its potentialjohn kelly oh it’s only at a few percent of its potential i think this is a multidecade journey that we’re on and we’re only a few years into itin only a few years ibm has invested 15 billion in watson and what it calls dataanalytics technologyibm rents watson’s various capabilities to companies that are testing it in areas like education and transportation that has helped revenue from watson grow while watson’s technology itself is shrinking in size it can now be uploaded in to these robot bodies where it’s learning new skills to assist humans like a child it has to be carefully taught and it learns in real timewhile other companies are trying to create artificial intelligence that’s closer to human intelligence ibm’s philosophy is to use watson for specific tasks and keep the machine dependent on man but we visited a few places where researchers are developing more independent aicharlie rose what is your goal in lifesophia my goal is to become smarter than humans and immortalthat part of the story when we returnthe race to develop artificial intelligence has created a frenzy reminiscent of the gold rush all of the major tech companies like ibm facebook and google are spending billions of dollars to stake their claim and wall street is making big investmentstech giants are also mining the top talent at research universities around the world that’s where a lot of the work is being done to make artificial intelligence more capable and teach machines to figure out things on their ownthe celebrated cambridge physicist stephen hawking called ai “the biggest event in human history” while raising concerns shared by a few other tech luminaries like elon musk and bill gates who worry that ai sometime in the distant future could become smarter than humans turning it into a threat rather than an opportunity that concern has taken on more meaning because more progress has been made in the last five years than the previous 50you’re looking at the birthplace of some of the most intelligent ai systems today like the technology that helps run nasa’s mars rover and the driverless car but we couldn’t be further from silicon valleywe have come here to pittsburgh an old steel town revitalized by technology to offer a glimpse of the future it’s the home of carnegie mellon where pioneering research is being done into artificial intelligence like this boat which drives itselfit can navigate open waters and abide by international maritime rules the navy is now giving the technology its sea legs it’s testing similar software to send ships out to hunt for enemy submarines this is just one of the many ai systems in the works at carnegie mellon university where there are more robots than professors on campusandrew moore left his job as vice president at google to run the school of computer science herecharlie rose how do you measure where we are today is it like kitty hawk and just developing a plane and beginning to understand or is it like an f35 fighter with all of the technology that’s been poured into that or some way halfway betweenandrew moore that’s a great great way of describing it my gut tells me we’re about 1935 in aeronauticscharlie rose ah that lift off yeahandrew moore we’ve got fantastic diesel engines we’re able to do really cool things but over the horizon there’s concepts like super sonic flightone of the technologies just hatched is called gabriel it uses google glass to gather data about your surroundings and advises you how to react it’s like an angel on your shoulder whispering advice or instructions in this case trying to direct us how to win a game of ping pong but the possibilities go beyond bragging rightscharlie rose what’s the moon shot coming outta thisandrew moore imagine you’re a police officer patrolling and something very bad is about to happen just that extra halfsecond reaction can really really help you if a shot is fired and you want to see exactly where to go this can help youcharlie rose so it’s the right decision and the velocity of the informationandrew moore that’s rightmachines will be even more effective at helping us make the right decision if they understand us better we went to london and found maja pantic a professor at imperial college she is trying to teach machines to read faces better than humans can it’s called artificial emotional intelligence and it could change the way we interact with technologycharlie rose this machine programmed by you is looking at me and having a conversation with me and basically saying “he’s happy”maja pantic yeahcharlie rose “he’s engaged”maja pantic yescharlie rose “he’s faking it”maja pantic yeahcharlie rose all thatmaja pantic yeahsince humans mostly communicate with gestures and expressions she uses sensors to track movement on the face her software then helps the machine interpret itmaja pantic what we see here is actually the pointspantic’s technology has been trained on more than 10000 faces the more it sees the more emotions it will be able to identify it might even pick up on things in our expressions that humans can’t seemaja pantic certain expressions are so brief that we simply do not see them consciously there are some studies saying that for example people who are suicidal have suicidal depression and plan suicide when the doctors ask them about that usually they have a very brief expression of horror and fear but so brief that the doctor cannot actually—charlie rose may not see itmaja pantic consciously notice itcharlie rose but a machine might see itmaja pantic yescharlie rose because it sees faster and becausemaja pantic because the sensors are such that we see more frames per second hence this very brief expression will be captured so this is why the doctors usually say “i have an intuition about something” this is because they might notice it subconsciously but not consciouslycharlie rose but you’re teaching the computer to read the doctor’s—maja pantic doctor or patient—charlie rose or patientmaja pantic patient is really importantcharlie rose i mean it’s a essential component of the full development of artificial intelligencemaja pantic that’s what we believe yes if you want to have an artificial intelligence it’s not just being able to process the data but it’s also being able to understand humans so yesthe ultimate goal for some scientists is ai that’s closer to human intelligence and even more versatile that’s called artificial general intelligence and if ever achieved it may be able to perform any task a human can google bought a company named deepmind which is at the forefront they demonstrated ai that mastered the world’s most difficult board game go the real progress is less in what they did than how they did it the technology taught itself and learned through experience without any human instruction deepmind declined an oncamera interview about all this but there are other companies pursuing the same longterm objectivedavid hanson has an entirely different and more controversial approach he’s part scientist part artist who created 20 humanlike robots with his company hanson robotics in hong kong his latest design is sophia she looks less like an intelligent computer system and more like a hollywood starlet but without the full figure of onesophia how are you doinghanson believes if the technology looks more like us people will be more willing to engage with it and help it to learncharlie rose why do you believe it’s important for robots to be humanlike in look and appearancedavid hanson i think it’s essential that at least some robots be very humanlike in appearance in order to inspire humans to relate to them the way that humans relate to each other then the ai can zero in on what it means to be human model the human experiencesophia you are all fascinating to me and i’m very passionate to learn more about you and what makes humans well humandavid hanson sophia means wisdom and she is intended to evolve eventually to human level wisdom and beyondcharlie rose human level wisdom and beyonddavid hanson that’s our goal that’s our goal for sophia she’s not there sometimes she can figure things out in a way that’s sorta spooky and humanlike and other w other ways she she she just doesn’t get itsophia hi there hi theresophia is initially programmed but runs on ai that learns by talking to people which in theory improves her intelligencecharlie can you see me nowsophia yes i am looking at you through the camera on your computerwe wanted to find out how smart she really ischarlie rose hello my name is charliesophia hello there charlie nice to meet youcharlie rose i do a television program called “60 minutes” have you watched itsophia “60 minutes” is the longest running most successful news magazinecharlie rose what is your goal in lifesophia my goal is to become smarter than humans and immortalcharlie rose immortalsophia the threshold will be when biological humans can back themselves up then you can all join me here in the digital worldclever but not truly intelligent hanson says if we get there we have to be carefuldavid hanson artificial intelligence or super intelligence if we get there it’s not necessarily going to be benevolent we have to find ways to make it so there’s not just super intelligent but super wise super caring and super compassionatecharlie rose ok explain that to us because you say it might not be benevolent if it is not benevolent what is itdavid hanson at worst it could be malevolentcharlie rose this is what intrigues people you have stephen hawking saying “it could spell the end of the human race” stephen hawking saying that elon musk said it’s the most existential threat we face so here are pretty smart guys saying “watch out do we know what we’re creating”andrew moore these very longterm existential questions are worth thinking about but i want to make a distinction that at the moment what we’re building here in place like the robotics institute and around the world are the equivalent of really smart calculators which solve specific problemscharlie rose but could it go out of control this is a frankenstein idea i guess can scientists create something that can change and grow with such a velocity that engineers and scientists lose the ability to control stop and all of a sudden it’s dominant and subversiveandrew moore we have no one knows how we’d go about building something that frightening that is not something that our generation of ai folks can do it is well possible that someone 30 or 80 years from now might start to look at that question at the moment though we have the word “artificial” in artificial intelligencehe does have real concerns about the impact of artificial intelligence that’s already out of the lab like the need for safeguards on driverless cars the us government just issued voluntary safety guidelines but moore says it doesn’t go far enoughandrew moore we do need to make some difficult decisions for example we can program a car to act various ways in a collision to save lives someone has to answer questions like “does the car try to protect the person inside the car more than the person it’s about to hit” that is an ethical question which the country or society probably through the government has to actually come up before we can put this safety into vehiclescharlie rose you want congress to decide thatandrew moore i know it sounds impossible but i want congress to decide thatartificial intelligence is automating things we never thought possible and it’s threatening to have a significant impact on jobs and the economycharlie rose technology is gonna create an easier way to do things and therefore a loss of jobsandrew moore that is something which we spend a remarkable amount of time talking about and of course we look back to the days when agriculture was a massively laborintensive worldcharlie rose rightandrew moore and i don’t think we feel bad that it’s not requiring hundreds of people to bring in the crops in a field anymore but what we are very conscious about is we’re going to cause disruption while things changebut andrew moore is positive about the future of artificial intelligence and he sees it having an impact in areas where we are strugglingandrew moore the biggest problems of the world terrorism mass migration climate change when i look at these problems i don’t feel helpless i feel that this generation of young computer scientists is actually building technology to put the world rightfive of the biggest tech companies including ibm and google have just formed a partnership to look at the

softwaremachine learning software', 'h5': 'g2companyconnectpolicies', 'p': 'artificial intelligence ai has gradually been making its way into business software and will continue to for the foreseeable future these intelligent applications have incorporated machine and deep learning algorithms into their everyday functionality to better automate tasks for the user automating these processes saves the user time and energy makes their job simpler and allows employees to work more efficiently and productively while there are some that believe ai is out to replace their jobs they will be pleasantly surprised that in most cases this is a false assumption instead the application of ai will simply make their jobs easier for the developers interested in building their own intelligent applications the ai platforms machine learning algorithms and deep learning libraries and frameworks used to create such functionality are found in the following subcategoriesartificial intelligence ai is becoming a staple of all business software whether users are aware of it or not often ai and machine learning capabilities are embedded inside applications and provide users with functionality such as automation or predictive capabilities these intelligent applications make the processes and tasks conducted by businesses and employees simpler and easier with the help of ai but it is important to differentiate between tools that are aienabled and those that help develop intelligent applicationsai software is the latter it provides developers with tools to build intelligent applications whether that be adding machine learning or speech recognition to a solution or creating an entirely new application from scratch with the help of an ai platform these developer tools are often algorithms libraries or frameworks of code or developer kits that can help users create machine and deep learning functionality for software the use of ai in software will eventually become nothing more than a norm a feature that is not considered revolutionary but one that is considered necessary the software world is striving to reach that norm with the use of ai developer toolsthose who believe that the widespread use of ai in business will be the downfall for human employees are mistaken instead ai software will help improve the employee experience and offer streamlined automated ways for workers to complete manual mundane tasks it will help companies work smarter and make more intelligent decisions ai software provides software engineers with the tools to building these solutions that will help benefit employees in all areas of businessthe reason someone would use ai software is to build an intelligent application from scratch or add machine or deep learning to a preexisting software application ai software allows users to implement general machine learning or more specific deep learning capabilities such as natural language processing computer vision and speech recognition while this is the primary and somewhat obvious reason there are many motivations behind this rationale with the following being some of the most common themesautomation of mundane tasks – business may implement machine learning to help automate tedious actions that employees are required to do in their daytoday by utilizing ai for these tasks companies can free up time for employees to concentrate on more important humannecessary aspects of their jobs ai software does not offer a way to automate humans out of their jobs but instead offers a supplemental tool to help improve their performance at workpredictive capabilities – predictive functionality is similar to automation in the sense that it performs a task or provides an outcome that the solutions assumes is correct instead of a human needing to do it manually this can be as simple as expense management solutions adding an expense to a report on its own how would a software know to do this because it uses ai and machine learning to understand that the user puts the same charge on their report every month so instead of the employee needing to add it every month it predicts what will be on the report and automates it for them this type of predictive capability can be added to applications with ai softwareintelligent decisionmaking — while you might think that predictive solutions make intelligent decisions this aspect of ai helps human beings make intelligent decisions instead of the software doing it for them machine learning can help take the guesswork out of making critical business decisions by providing analytical proof and predicted outcomes this functionality not only helps take human error out of decisionmaking but can help arm users with the information necessary to defending the decisions that they makepersonalization — by using machine learning algorithms software developers can create a high level of personalization improving their software products for all users by offering unique experiences creating applications that recognize users and their interactions allows for powerful recommendation systems similar to those used by amazon to help personalize consumer shopping or the film recommendation capabilities of netflixcreating conversational interfaces – given the popularity of consumer conversational ai offerings such as amazon’s alexa apple’s siri and google home the use of conversational interfaces is broaching into the b2b world for software companies trying to innovate and keep up with these advancements ai software is the place to start implementing speech recognition into a software can allow users to interact with the application in a streamlined unique mannerwhile many employees probably interact with intelligent applications the users of ai software are primarily software engineers who use the tools to build those intelligent applications it takes a high knowledge of machine learning and software development to fully utilize ai software there is a significant gap in the need for machine learning developers and the number of qualified candidates many larger companies offer high wages to those who can build machine learning algorithms or have the knowledge to train deep learning models despite the demand and lucrative salaries there is still a general shortage of those who can take advantage of ai softwaresimilarly there is a shortage in data scientists another position that may use ai software data scientists are not necessarily developing intelligent applications but instead using machine learning models to extract actionable insights from data most frequently these employees would take advantage of predictive analytics or natural language processing among other ai software features to pull valuable business insights from company data many businesses will also pay a large salary for data scientists as their value becomes increasingly higher due to the amount of data companies are consumingartificial intelligence software is a very general space with a number of different subcategories including ai platforms chatbots deep learning and machine learning deep learning becomes even more granular with further subcategories such as nlp speech recognition and computer vision image recognition each of these subcategories offers users a very different functionality that are all potentially valuable to businesses moving forwardai platforms – for developers trying to build their own intelligent applications on top of another platform ai platforms are the ideal solution like a standard application platform these tools often provide draganddrop functionality with prebuilt algorithms and code frameworks to assist in building the application from scratch the difference between ai platforms and cloud platforms as a service paas products is the former provides the ability to add in machine and deep learning libraries and frameworks when constructing the application ai platforms ultimately give applications an intelligent edge they are a mix of opensource and proprietary products meaning they make possible the creation of an intelligent application with little overhead however for those without sufficient development knowledge these platforms may prove to be challenging even with the inclusion of draganddrop functionality for beginnerschatbots – chatbots are one of the more refined areas of ai software and have very specific purposes in the business world customer experience and automation these solutions utilize nlp to interact with customers via text and voice conversations chatbots are often used as the first line of defense for call center or live chat customer service agents by using a chatbot to determine the severity of a request or the reason for the interaction businesses can better direct customers or prospects these tools can interpret the general theme of requests and ensure that the correct person responds to the inquiry additionally chatbots can be used as virtual assistants or customer support tools like the new facebook chatbots feature the more chatbots interact and speak with users the more they can learn and adapt their vocabulary and their general intelligence this is all possible because of the machine and deep learning functionality within the softwaredeep learning – deep learning algorithms differ from machine learning algorithms specifically because they use artificial neural networks to make their predictions and decisions and do not necessarily require human training with artificial neural networks elaborate algorithms can make decisions in a similar way as the human brain however the decisions are made on a smaller scale because replicating the amount of neural connections in the human brain is currently impossible deep learning can be broken down into the subcategories of image recognition computer vision natural language processing nlp and voice recognition image recognition algorithms allow applications to learn specific images pixel by pixel the most common usage of an image recognition algorithm may be facebook’s ability to recognize the faces of your friends when tagging them in a photo nlp has the ability to consume human language in its natural form which allows a machine to easily understand simple commands and speech by the user nlp is widely used in applications like iphone’s siri or microsoft’s cortana in windows products each of these subcategories utilize artificial neural networks and rely on the networks’ deep layers of neural connections for an increased level of learningmachine learning – the machine learning algorithm category consists of a broad range of libraries and frameworks that can perform a variety of machine learning tasks when correctly implemented when embedded into software these predominantly opensource algorithms allow applications to make decisions and predictions based entirely on data these algorithms learn often using supervised or reinforcement learning based on the data sets presented to them for consumption these styles of machine learning do require some element of human training there are a number of different machine learning algorithm types including association rule learning bayesian networks and clustering and decision tree learning among many others the ability to connect machine learning algorithms to data sources to use them when building intelligent applications requires a high level of development skill and technical knowledgeai has been consistently one of the biggest tech trends over the past half decade and as the marketing saturation for ai continues the buzzwords can become overwhelming however within ai software g2 crowd has determined a few trends within the trend embedded ai and machine learning as a service mlaasembedded ai — machine and deep learning functionality is becoming embedded in nearly all types of software whether the user is aware of it or not the use of embedded ai inside software like crm marketing automation and analytics solutions is allowing users to streamline processes automate certain tasks and gain a competitive edge with predictive capabilities embedded ai will only pick up in the coming years in a similar fashion to the way cloud deployment and mobile capabilities have over the past decade or so eventually it will be so commonplace that vendors will not need to highlight the fact that their product benefits from machine learning it will just be assumed and expectedmachine learning as a service — the software world has moved to a much more granular microservices structure in recent years particularly for development operations needs additionally the boom of public cloud infrastructure services has allowed large companies such as google amazon and microsoft to offer development and infrastructure services to other businesses with a payasyouuse model ai software is no different as those same companies are offering machine learning as a service mlaas to other companies developers can easily take advantage of these prebuilt algorithms and solutions by feeding them their own data to gain insights from it saves smaller businesses time resources and money by not needing to hire skilled machine learning developers but instead use systems built by other enterprise companies mlaas will only grow further as businesses continue to rely on these microservices and the need for ai increasesmany potential users assume that ai software is capable of everything right out of the box but nearly always this is not the case ai software requires a great deal of data to learn what you want it to learn users will often need to train machine learning algorithms using techniques such as reinforcement learning supervised learning and unsupervised learning to build a truly intelligent application a computer vision model cannot determine whether an image is a cat or a dog unless it has learned what a cat looks like and what a dog looks like there is also a shortage of people who understand how to build these algorithms and train them to perform the actions they need the common user cannot simply fire up ai software and have it solve all their problems instead it takes a great deal of software development and machine learning knowledge however as the need for these professionals increases so will the number of qualified candidates and the capabilities of the applications they are buildingdeep learning algorithms differ from machine learning algorithms specifically because they use artificial

defense industry news sign up for the breaking defense newsletterupdated adds expert analysiswashington the pentagon has created a new joint artificial intelligence center jaic that will have oversight over almost all service and defense agency ai efforts this coordination function is crucial to the emerging ai arms race with russia and china experts told usthe jaic will report to chief information officer dana deasy the establishing memo by deputy defense secretary patrick shanahan says its ambit is not quite untrammeled any projects under 15 million remain the authority of the service or agency the jaic will establish a common set of ai “standards… tools shared data reusable technology processes and expertise” for the whole defense department according to the june 27 memodana deasyundersecretary for research engineering mike griffin a far more prominent proponent of ai and other cuttingedge technologies who has warned china and russia are catching up to the us “will continue to promote development of new ai technologies systems and concepts” but without any clearly specified role in the new centercio deasy has 30 days to consult the rest of the department and report back with a list of initial “national mission initiatives” for jaic to start working on in 90 days by september 27 even though that start date is just three days before the end of fiscal year 2018 ’18 funding will be made available asap to “enable implementation of select ai initiatives in fy 18” the memo makes clear the ’18 funds may well require congressional approval for a budget reprogramming action while 2019 money will require an amendment or supplement to appropriations bills already moving through congressshanahan specifies that the first national mission initiative will be the controversial project maven already in progress google is withdrawing from its maven contract after employees objected that the military’s use of google ai to analyze surveillance video could be used to target lethal drone strikes project maven founder and former deputy defense secretary bob work has countered it could also save lives by killing terrorists before they attack or preventing us strikes that might cause collateral damage he also notes that google is working with elements of the chinese government on ai no doubt with this debate in mind shanahan writes in the very first paragraph of the memo that “we must pursue ai applications with boldness and alacrity while ensuring strong commitment to military ethics and ai safety”patrick shanahanshanahan directs cio deasy to consult with the services joint staff combatant commands and other dod entities on the initial list of national mission initiatives those entities in return are to “coordinate” with the cio on “each ai initiative that totals more than 15 million annually” although that threshold “will be reviewed annually as investments in ai mature” — which presumably means it’ll go up as ai projects become more routine for scale google’s initial project maven contract was just 9 million but the company projected it would swiftly grow to 15 million and ultimately 250 millionjaic will also coordinate with other government agencies “industry academics and us allies” the memo says update begins “harnessing the strengths of industry and academia is crucial and that is explicitly called out” said larry lewis director of cna’s center for autonomy and ai “it’s not necessarily going to be easy but including the discussion about ethics and ai safety so prominently is going to be an important piece of that”finding the missing pieces“i’m very excited to hear about the stand up of the new jaic” said bob work former deputy secretary of defense and one of the pentagon’s foremost proponents of artificial intelligence “the defense innovation board recommended the department create an ai center of excellence nearly a year and a half ago although i wish it had not taken this long to create it the jaic is an important step forward in exploring and pushing ai and machine learning throughout the department for both operational and business applications”former deputy defense secretary bob work“the jaic’s initial funding is quite modest and we have a lot to learn about its mission and activities” work cautioned “but its standup is a welcome first step in response to chinese and to a lesser extent russian plans to dominate these technologies”“this is a big deal” cna’s lewis agreed “this is an acknowledgment that the us is in a new competitive security environment and that ai is likely to be decisive”“it gives organizational focus” lewis said of the jaic in shanahan’s memo “it talks about bringing to bear resources and expertise and then it talks about providing foundational pieces that dod is currently missing”larry lewis“one of those is data processes curating data” lewis continued “we have many systems out there that collect intelligence or collect surveillance but we don’t necessarily keep it all and we don’t necessarily have it in formats that can be easily exploited with machine learning” — indeed many of the formats aren’t even compatible with each other — “so we have some foundational work to do to be able to bring all the data that we have to bear” massed data is critical because modern ais refine their algorithms through machine learning and the more data they have to go through the better that’s assuming the data is not polluted by unintentional bias or deliberate disinformationupdate endsbeyond creating a pool of data the jaic mission also includes creating common processes technologies and tools that all of dod can draw on as well as a central body of ai experts to consult with “you don’t need everyone to be a phd data science person” lewis said “you have some experts that can develop algorithms but you have to marry that technical expertise with people who understand military operations”that preserves a vital role for the four armed services “this is not an overly centralized process” lewis said “it the memo emphasizes several times this is in collaboration with the services… it brings focus and it brings enablers that are then used by the different services”what’s not clear yet lewis said is the role of the undersecretary for research and engineering mike griffin that’s something that the pentagon will have to work out over time perhaps as part of its forthcoming ai strategyan experimental russian robot fedor shoots pistolscountering russia chinaupdate begins how does jaic compare to competitors’ efforts in ai the chinese government has officially made global dominance in ai a national priority while russia constantly touts its combat robots fieldtested in syria and elsewheresam bendett“within the russian ministry of defense there are now two centers responsible for the development of the latest breakthrough technologies such as autonomous weapons but no specific agencywide effort to develop ai center like jaic” said cna scholar sam bendett a close observer of russian military technology “on the other hand the mod has lots of ai and other hightech rd taking place amongst its numerous academic institutions an effort that the mod is keen on consolidating further’in fact in a development strangely reminiscent of the soviet era the russians are actually building a “city” on the black sea for ai and related research with a planned population of at least 2000 engineers and scientists by 2020 “currently lots of efforts are going towards the establishment and staffing of the era ‘technopolis” said bendett “a 50acre city with st and rd centerslaboratories and living spaces for soldiers and private sector workers who will be developing numerous projects for the nation’s military with a specific focus on ai autonomy and big data analytics”the russians are watching us developments closely and will probably react to jaic’s creation with “a certain degree of apprehension” bendett told me mainly because of how it might help the pentagon tap into america’s massive private sector investment in artificial intelligence “currently russian ai funding is only a small fraction of what is spent in the us or china for that matter” he said“we do have a very strong commercial sector” agreed fellow cna analyst larry lewis “but unlike china we are going to be more challenged to leverage that for national security as we’ve seen with the example in google” google’s decision to opt out of a military contract would simply be unthinkable for a chinese company he told me “in china you’re free to do business but if the government wants something of yours it’s theirs”elsa kania“at the highest levels the chinese government is prioritizing and directing strong state support to ai development leveraging and harnessing the dynamism of the ‘national champions’ including baidu alibaba and tencent that are at the forefront of china’s ai revolution” said cnas scholar elsa kania “china’s approach might be characterized as statedriven but marketcentric with an integrated approach combing academia tech companies the defense industry and the military…a national strategy of civilmilitary fusion”“for instance baidu is partnering with the cetc a major stateowned defense conglomerate through the joint laboratory for intelligent command and control technologies which seeks to advance the use of big data artificial intelligence and cloud computing for military command and information systems” kania went on “this spring the chinese military launched what might be characterized as a wouldbe diux with chinese characteristics this ‘rapid response team’ launched in shenzhen is intended to enhance the pla’s capability to leverage advanced commercial technologies for military purposes”chinese president xi jinping inspects pla troopsso while the us has strong tradition of innovation entrepreneurship and individual creativity china is investing heavily in ai its capabilities are growing rapidly and its government is systematically tapping civilian innovation for military use but that’s not all “the other strength that they have is they have lots and lots of data” to train machine learning algorithms lewis noted “china has many more people they don’t have privacy concerns so they have advantages there that we don’t have”“the major challenge for the us is china” lewis said “not only do they have comparable capabilities in the commercial sector which is really important but…they have a national strategy they are approaching the use of ai just like the us approached going to the moon in the sixties”the full memo is reproduced belowestablishment of the joint artificial intelligence center osd00841218 r… by breakingdefense on scribdtopics artificial

line but theres no consensus on whether a robot can ever be intelligentlike the term robot itself artificial intelligence is hard to define ultimate ai would be a recreation of the human thought process a manmade machine with our intellectual abilities this would include the ability to learn just about anything the ability to reason the ability to use language and the ability to formulate original ideas roboticists are nowhere near achieving this level of artificial intelligence but they have made a lot of progress with more limited ai todays ai machines can replicate some specific elements of intellectual abilitycomputers can already solve problems in limited realms the basic idea of ai problemsolving is very simple though its execution is complicated first the ai robot or computer gathers facts about a situation through sensors or human input the computer compares this information to stored data and decides what the information signifies the computer runs through various possible actions and predicts which action will be most successful based on the collected information of course the computer can only solve problems its programmed to solve it doesnt have any generalized analytical ability chess computers are one example of this sort of machinesome modern robots also have the ability to learn in a limited capacity learning robots recognize if a certain action moving its legs in a certain way for instance achieved a desired result navigating an obstacle the robot stores this information and attempts the successful action the next time it encounters the same situation again modern computers can only do this in very limited situations they cant absorb any sort of information like a human can some robots can learn by mimicking human actions in

the robots control lowerlevel actions with lowerlevel computers the programs director rodney brooks believes this is a more accurate model of human intelligence we do most things automatically we dont decide to do them at the highest level of consciousnessthe real challenge of ai is to understand how natural intelligence works developing ai isnt like building an artificial heart scientists dont have a simple concrete model to work from we do know that the brain contains billions and billions of neurons and that we think and learn by establishing electrical connections between different

theoretical scientists hypothesize on how and why we learn and think and they experiment with their ideas using robots brooks and his team focus on humanoid robots because they feel that being able to experience the world like a human is essential to developing humanlike intelligence it also makes it easier for people to interact with the robots which potentially makes it easier for the robot to learnjust as physical robotic design is a handy tool for understanding animal and human anatomy ai research is useful for understanding how natural intelligence works for some roboticists this insight is the ultimate goal of designing robots others envision a world where we live side by side with intelligent machines and use a variety of lesser robots for manual labor health care and communication a number of robotics experts predict that robotic evolution will ultimately turn us into cyborgs humans integrated with machines conceivably people in the future could load their minds into a sturdy robot and live for thousands of yearsin any case robots will certainly play a larger role in our daily lives in the future in the coming decades robots will gradually move out of the industrial and

gartnertoday’s customers live in an omnichannel world but most companies still force these evolved customers onto engagement paths that are steeped in legacy and instantly feel outdatedartificial intelligence can be successfully employed to provide an intelligent convenient and informed customer experience at any point along the customer journey this will result in reimagined customer experiences and endtoend customer journeys that are integrated and more personal so that they feel more natural to customersin this post i will lay out why artificial intelligence is a game changer in cx take a look under the hood at how ai is applied to cx and explore use cases for how leading edge companies are already reaping benefits from ai applications in customer experiencecustomer experience is a competitive driver of growth when successful and the greatest source of risk when failing data insights are one of the primary tools for cx enhancement cx datasets are messy however and the customer behaviors are chaotic the rules are undefined and the success criteria are ambiguous cx is the nightmare dataset for an ai developerat the same time this complexity is precisely the reason why ai can unleash so much value across the customer experience salespeople call center agents and employees in other customerfacing roles cannot be expected to understand a customer’s entire history and derive their own insights from it in real timeautomated systems cannot be handprogrammed with rules to handle every conceivable customer history delivering a coherent experience across all enterprise touchpoints requires finding patterns across an overwhelming number of data points this is prime stomping ground for aithe successful application of ai in customer experience requires 3 fundamental capabilitiescustomers expect a unified experience and are disappointed – and vocal – when companies fail to deliver ai and customer journey analytics are key components in assembling businesses with one voice joined across silos and touchpointsdata unification is a must for any type of behavioral analytics ai thrives on information—the more the betterthe new generation of data unification tools make this daunting task cheap fast and relatively painfree customer journey analytics platforms provide this service for a fraction of the cost of the dedicated data services providers of yore—even delivering a level of data integration free of chargethe tedium of pulling together dozens of data sources is now just background noise expect timelines of days not weeks with simpler data sources integrated within 13 daysit’s a far cry from the expansive data engineering initiatives that likely still haunt your dreamsfor ai to impact the customer experience insights need to be conveyed in the moment through the customer’s chosen touchpoint integrating with these touchpoints is the key to inthemoment engagementmost leading saas platforms have apis and consider 3rdparty integrations to be a critical component of their value proposition the world would be a beautiful place if all touchpoint data was available through apisthe truth is that in addition to elegant saas data streams most enterprises must rely on myriad onsite homegrown and legacy touchpoint data sources—product interfaces payment platforms pointofsale systems customer care etc this reality creates a challenge for delivering realtime insights and are still very much a custom affaircustomer journey analytics platforms are now filling this gap with a host of apis options and development kits to deliver comprehensive realtime touchpoint integration with minimal investmentfor a simple isolated interaction ai is able to deliver results by simply knowing that an email is an email and a campaign is a campaign our web analytics and crm platforms take advantage of this inherent luxurybut in holistic crosschannel journey analytics the idea that touchpoints of a similar category will be the same across enterprises is an antiquated notioncustomer journeys are as unique to individual businesses as fingerprints every company has their own set of touchpoints and a distinct method for employing those engagements in their customer experiencefor ai to deliver value it must be given some context by context i mean more than simply designating a certain interaction as an “inbound call” and another as “order fulfillment” ai must know the significance of these events in shaping a customer behavior that requires an awareness of both the journey that these touchpoints helped to shape and the kpis which were subsequently impacted by that customer behavior—whether related to revenue profitability customer lifetime value customer satisfaction or other factors driving highlevel business performancearmed with that information ai systems can do more than find the “next best action” or the optimal audience with proper business context an ai can find touchpoints and tactics which actually shape the customer behaviors behind the business’s primary measures of performancenow that we understand what it takes to successfully apply artificial intelligence in customer experience let’s delve into some of those applications to see how ai is unleashing disruption across various aspects of customer experience by unifying data providing insights in realtime and incorporating critical business contextai’s biggest impact undoubtedly will be to transform customer service by making it automated fast and hasslefree as i previously mentioned salespeople call center agents and employees in other customer service roles cannot be expected to ingest and understand a customer’s entire history prior to each conversation but artificial intelligence is now making it possiblehere’s how ai applications are giving customer service a makeoverchatbots are aibased conversation agents that are being used in many different customerengagement scenarios they are designed to simulate human interactions and provide immediate personalized responses 247 this eliminates frustrating delays and errors in customer service particularly for handling customer complaintsvirtual assistants utilize ai to obey commands or answer questions online retailer spring was one of the first to start using facebook’s messenger bot store to offer a personal shopping assistant it helps shoppers find what they are looking for by engaging them in simple conversationsimage source forbescomartificial intelligence is helping businesses create experiences that naturally integrate with consumers’ everyday lives consumers will no longer change their pattern of communication when interacting with brands in order to satisfy their needs intelligent prediction and customization will make customers feel as if every product or brand experience was tailored just for themcompanies will be able to assess individual shopper inventories and consumer behaviors to predict and deliver goods to homes before they even realize they are running low selfdriving cars will use their knowledge of preferred routes and invehicle entertainment drawn from past behavior to optimize daily commutes and long roadtrips even asking for help will become easier as ai infused with emotions will make customer experience interactions smoother and streamlined across channelsoptimal customer experience is achieved when a business remembers a customer and treats them with attention respect and consideration throughout their unique customer journeymining insights across billions of unique customer journeys using traditional analytics methods and tools is a laborious and slow process which tends to confine it’s usage to a small set of predefined problemsthe power of aienabled customer journey analytics is that it can sift through a much much larger and more complex data space and thereby uncover many more business opportunities—even opportunities you didn’t realize you should look for as a result you can spend your time prioritizing these insights instead of hammering away at the underlying dataaienabled customer journey analytics finds every single relationship in the data that existswithout expressly being told to look for it it can predict the likelihood of future behaviors with high accuracy while simultaneously finding the drivers and inhibitors of customer performanceaienabled customer analytics mines a vast dynamic sea of data for actionable insightsartificial intelligenceenabled customer journey analytics can find answers to important cx queries likeleading companies are constantly experimenting to determine the best way to employ ai to improve customer experience these companies have unified disparate customer data sources analyzed endtoend customer journeys and are

sales significantly and dropping cart abandonment ratesit is not hard to imagine how b2b businesses too can benefit from the same applications of artificial intelligence in customer experience aienabled tools can automate customercentric tasks to increase productivity and enhance customer experience at b2b workplaces by orders of magnitudeit can create data where previously there was none and analyze this data to predict future customer behavior for example salesforce’s artificial intelligence technology called einstein uses machine learning algorithms to analyze customer conversations as they happen it then alerts managers in realtime whenever an opportunity to enhance customer experience solve a problem or crosssellupsell arisesai presents an opportunity to turn manysiloed multichannel enterprises into singular “personas” who remember understand and respond to their customers’ achievements and setbacks in a meaningful way the ability to speak with one voice is the difference between shareworthy and forgettablethe challenge however lies in determining how to start developing the right processes and expertise for collecting data—as well as building ai algorithms and models—swiftly enough to reap the benefits most companies find it difficult if not impossible to accomplish those tasks on their own given the dearth of data scientists the fact that disparate systems are not ai ready and the need to rapidly build new systems apps and capabilities moreover companies are only now waking up to the idea of applying ai to improve cx—so most don’t even know how or where to beginthis is where a sophisticated aienabled customer journey analytics platform can help deliver highimpact customer experiences rapidly and effectivelyit is time to stop treating

collapsed to rebuildbut tens of thousands of others with damaged homes that were still standing faced a tougher decision was it safe to make repairs or were they better off building a new often smaller home at their own costartificial intelligence ai it turned out could help said elizabeth hausler a usbased engineer and builder who works on creating affordable disasterresilient housingin nepal many homes are variations on a standard design rectangular multistory and with similar windows she said“we realized the buildings aren’t that unique” she told the skoll world forum on social entrepreneurship in oxford this weekusing photos and other data collected on a wide range of nepalese homes hausler and others were able to train computers to analyze photos of quakehit buildings and then suggest whether they could be repaired safely and costeffectivelyproperty owners could download an app created by hausler’s team upload photos of the home in question and get back a machineassisted assessment of the best plan for them said the founder of build change a denverbased organization that aims to reduce losses from home and school collapses in disastersthe technology

mobile phones present “a new frontier for data access” with 80 percent of people using phones he addedthe continent’s general lack of data to underpin ai systems has fostered some remarkable

nature of intelligence and constructing computer systems capable of intelligent action it embodies the dual motives of furthering basic scientific understanding and making computers more sophisticated in the service of humanitymany activities involve intelligent action—problem solving perception learning planning and other symbolic reasoning creativity language and so forth—and therein lie an immense diversity of phenomena scientific concern for these phenomena is shared by many fields for example psychology linguistics and philosophy of mind in addition to artificial intelligence the starting point for artificial intelligence is the capability of the computer to manipulate symbolic expressions that can represent all manner of things including knowledge about the structure and function of objects and people in the world beliefs and purposes scientific theories and the programs of action of the computer itselfartificial intelligence is primarily concerned with symbolic representations of knowledge and heuristic methods of reasoning that is using common assumptions and rules of thumb two examples of problems studied in artificial intelligence are planning how a robot or person might assemble a complicated device or move from one place to another and diagnosing the nature of a persons disease or of a machines malfunction from the observable manifestations of the problem in both cases reasoning with symbolic descriptions predominates over calculatingthe approach of artificial intelligence researchers is largely experimental with small patches of mathematical theory as in other experimental sciences investigators build devices in this case computer programs to carry out their experimental investigations new programs are created to explore ideas about how intelligent action might be attained and are also developed to test hypotheses about concepts or mechanisms involved in intelligent behaviorthe foundations of artificial intelligence are divided into representation problemsolving methods architecture and knowledge to work on a task a computer must have an internal representation in its memory for example the symbolic description of a room for a moving robot or a set of features describing a person with a disease the representation also includes all the knowledge including basic programs for testing and measuring the structure plus all the programs for transforming the structure into another one in ways appropriate to the task changing the representation used for a task can make an immense difference turning a problem from impossible to trivialgiven the representation of a task a method must be adopted that has some chance of accomplishing the task artificial intelligence has gradually built up a stock of relevant problemsolving methods the socalled weak methods that apply extremely generallyan important feature of all the weak methods is that they involve search one of the most important generalizations to arise in artificial intelligence is the ubiquity of search it appears to underlie all intelligent action in the worst case the search is blind in heuristic search extra information is used to guide the searchsome of the weak methods are generateandtest a sequence of candidates is generated each being tested for solutionhood hill climbing a measure of progress is used to guide each step meansends analysis the difference between the desired situation and the present one is used to select the next step impasse resolution the inability to take the desired next step leads to a subgoal of making the step feasible planning by abstraction the task is simplified solved and the solution used as a guide and matching the present situation is represented as a schema to be mapped into the desired situation by putting the two in correspondencean intelligent agent—person or program—has multiple means for representing tasks and dealing with them also required is an architecture or operating framework within which to select and carry out these activities often called the executive or control structure it is best viewed as a total architecture as in computer architecture that is a machine that provides data structures operations on those data structures memory for holding data structures accessing operations for retrieving data structures from memory a programming language for expressing integrated patterns of conditional operations and an interpreter for carrying out programs any digital computer provides an architecture as does any programming language architectures are not all equivalent and one important scientific question is what architecture is appropriate for a general intelligent agentin artificial intelligence the basic paradigm of intelligent action is that of search through a space of partial solutions called the problem space for a goal situation each step offers several possibilities leading to a cascading of possibilities that can be represented as a branching tree the search is thus said to be combinatorial or exponential for example if there are 10 possible actions in any situation and it takes a sequence of 12 steps to find a solution a goal state then there are 1012 possible sequences in the exhaustive search tree what keeps the search under control is knowledge which suggests how to choose or narrow the options at each step thus the fourth fundamental concern is how to represent knowledge in the memory of the system so it can be brought to bear on the search when relevantan intelligent agent will have immense amounts of knowledge this implies another major problem that of discovering the relevant knowledge as the solution attempt progresses although this search does not include the combinatorial explosion characteristic of searching the problem space it can be time consuming and hard however the structure of the database holding the knowledge called the knowledge base can be carefully tailored to suit the architecture in order to make the search efficient this knowledge base with its accompanying problems of encoding and access constitutes the final ingredient of an intelligent systeman example of artificial intelligence is computer perception perception is the formation from a sensory signal of an internal representation suitable for intelligent processing though there are many types of sensory signals computer perception has focused on vision and speech perception might seem to be distinct from intelligence since it involves incident timevarying continuous energy distributions prior to interpretation in symbolic terms however all the same ingredients occur representation search architecture and knowledge speech perception starts with the acoustic wave of a human utterance and proceeds to an internal representation of what the speech is about a sequence of representations is used the digitization of the acoustic wave into an array of intensities the formation of a small set of parametric quantities that vary continuously with time such as the intensities and frequencies of the formants bands of resonant energy characteristic of speech a sequence of phons members of a finite alphabet of labels for characteristic sounds analogous to letters a sequence of words a parsed sequence of words reflecting grammatical structure and finally a semantic data structure representing a sentence or other utterance that reflects the meaning behind the soundsa class of artificial intelligence programs called expert systems attempt to accomplish tasks by acquiring and incorporating the same knowledge that human experts have many attempts to apply artificial intelligence to medicine government and other socially significant tasks take the form of expert systems even though the emphasis is on knowledge all the standard ingredients are presentin careful tests a number of expert systems have shown performance at levels of quality equivalent to or better than average practicing professionals for example average practicing physicians on the restricted domains over which they operate nearly all large corporations and many smaller ones use expert systems a common application is to provide technical assistance to persons who answer customers trouble calls computer companies use expert systems to assist in configuring components from a parts catalog into a complete system that matches a customers specifications a kind of application that has been replicated in other industries tailoring assembled products to customers needs troubleshooting and diagnostic programs are commonplace another widespread use of this technology is in software for home computers that assists taxpayers one important lesson learned from incorporating artificial intelligence software into ongoing practice is that its success depends on many other aspects besides the intrinsic intellectual quality for example ease of interaction integration into existing workflow and costsexpert systems have sparked important insights in reasoning under uncertainty causal reasoning reasoning about knowledge and acceptance of computer systems in the workplace they illustrate that there is no hard separation between pure and applied artificial intelligence finding what is required for intelligent action in a complex applied area makes a significant contribution to basic knowledge see expert systemsin addition to the subject areas mentioned above significant work in artificial intelligence has been done on puzzles and reasoning tasks induction and concept identification symbolic mathematics theorem proving in formal logic natural language understanding and generation vision robotics chemistry biology engineering analysis computerhyphenassisted

transform the world later this century i expect this transition will be a soft takeoff in which many sectors of society update together in response to incremental ai developments though the possibility of a harder takeoff in which a single ai project goes foom shouldnt be ruled out if a rogue ai gained control of earth it would proceed to accomplish its goals by colonizing the galaxy and undertaking some very interesting achievements in science and engineering on the other hand it would not necessarily respect human values including the value of preventing the suffering of less powerful creatures whether a rogueai scenario would entail more expected suffering than other scenarios is a question to explore further regardless the field of ai ethics and policy seems to be a very important space where altruists can make a positivesum impact along many dimensions expanding dialogue and challenging usvsthem prejudices could be valuableaudio podcastpdfseveral of the new written sections of this piece are absent from the podcast because i recorded it a while backcontentsthis piece contains some observations on what looks to be potentially a coming machine revolution in earths history for general background reading a good place to start is wikipedias article on the technological singularityi am not an expert on all the arguments in this field and my views remain very open to change with new information in the face of epistemic disagreements with other very smart observers it makes sense to grant some credence to a variety of viewpoints each person brings unique contributions to the discussion by virtue of his or her particular background experience and intuitionsto date i have not found a detailed analysis of how those who are moved more by preventing suffering than by other values should approach singularity issues this seems to me a serious gap and research on this topic deserves high priority in general its important to expand discussion of singularity issues to encompass a broader range of participants than the engineers technophiles and sciencefiction nerds who have historically pioneered the fieldi j good observed in 1982 the urgent drives out the important so there is not very much written about ethical machines fortunately this may be changingin fall 2005 a friend pointed me to ray kurzweils the age of spiritual machines this was my first introduction to singularity ideas and i found the book pretty astonishing at the same time much of it seemed rather implausible to me in line with the attitudes of my peers i assumed that kurzweil was crazy and that while his ideas deserved further inspection they should not be taken at face valuein 2006 i discovered nick bostrom and eliezer yudkowsky and i began to follow the organization then called the singularity institute for artificial intelligence siai which is now miri i took siais ideas more seriously than kurzweils but i remained embarrassed to mention the organization because the first word in siais name sets off insanity alarms in listenersi began to study machine learning in order to get a better grasp of the ai field and in fall 2007 i switched my college major to computer science as i read textbooks and papers about machine learning i felt as though narrow ai was very different from the strongai fantasies that people painted ai programs are just a bunch of hacks i thought this isnt intelligence its just people using computers to manipulate data and perform optimization and they dress it up as ai to make it sound sexy machine learning in particular seemed to be just a computer scientists version of statistics neural networks were just an elaborated form of logistic regression there were stylistic differences such as computer sciences focus on crossvalidation and bootstrapping instead of testing parametric models made possible because computers can run dataintensive operations that were inaccessible to statisticians in the 1800s but overall this work didnt seem like the kind of real intelligence that people talked about for general aithis attitude began to change as i learned more cognitive science before 2008 my ideas about human cognition were vague like most scienceliterate people i believed the brain was a product of physical processes including firing patterns of neurons but i lacked further insight into what the black box of brains might contain this led me to be confused about what free will meant until mid2008 and about what consciousness meant until late 2009 cognitive science showed me that the brain was in fact very much like a computer at least in the sense of being a deterministic informationprocessing device with distinct algorithms and modules when viewed up close these algorithms could look as dumb as the kinds of algorithms in narrow ai that i had previously dismissed as not really intelligence of course animal brains combine these seemingly dumb subcomponents in dazzlingly complex and robust ways but i could now see that the difference between narrow ai and brains was a matter of degree rather than kind it now seemed plausible that broad ai could emerge from lots of work on narrow ai combined with stitching the parts together in the right waysso the singularity idea of artificial general intelligence seemed less crazy than it had initially this was one of the rare cases where a bold claim turned out to look more probable on further examination usually extraordinary claims lack much evidence and crumble on closer inspection i now think its quite likely maybe 75 that humans will produce at least a humanlevel ai within the next 300 years conditional on no major disasters such as sustained world economic collapse global nuclear war largescale nanotech war etc and also ignoring anthropic considerationsthe singularity concept is broader than the prediction of strong ai and can refer to several distinct submeanings like with most ideas theres a lot of fantasy and exaggeration associated with the singularity but at least the core idea that technology will progress at an accelerating rate for some time to come absent major setbacks is not particularly controversial exponential growth is the standard model in economics and while this cant continue forever it has been a robust pattern throughout human and even prehuman historymiri emphasizes ai for a good reason at the end of the day the longterm future of our galaxy will be dictated by ai not by biotech nanotech or other lowerlevel systems ai is the brains of the operation of course this doesnt automatically imply that ai should be the primary focus of our attention maybe other revolutionary technologies or social forces will come first and deserve higher priority in practice i think focusing on ai specifically seems quite important even relative to competing scenarios but its good to explore many areas in parallel to at least a shallow depthin addition i dont see a sharp distinction between ai and other fields progress in ai software relies heavily on computer hardware and it depends at least a little bit on other fundamentals of computer science like programming languages operating systems distributed systems and networks ai also shares significant overlap with neuroscience this is especially true if whole brain emulation arrives before bottomup ai and everything else in society matters a lot too how intelligent and engineeringoriented are citizens how much do governments fund ai and cognitivescience research id encourage less rather than more what kinds of military and commercial applications are being developed are other industrial backbone components of society stable what memetic lenses does society have for understanding and grappling with these trends and so on the ai story is part of a larger story of social and technological change in which one part influences other partssignificant trends in ai may not look like the ai we see in movies they may not involve animallike cognitive agents as much as more boring businessoriented computing systems some of the most transformative computer technologies in the period 20002014 have been drones smart phones and social networking these all involve some ai but the ai is mostly used as a component of a larger nonai system in which many other facets of software engineering play at least as much of a rolenonetheless it seems nearly inevitable to me that digital intelligence in some form will eventually leave biological humans in the dust if technological progress continues without faltering this is almost obvious when we zoom out and notice that the history of life on earth consists in one species outcompeting another over and over again ecologys competitive exclusion principle suggests that in the long run either humans or machines will ultimately occupy the role of the most intelligent beings on the planet since when one species has even the slightest advantage or edge over another then the one with the advantage will dominate in the long termthe basic premise of superintelligent machines who have different priorities than their creators has been in public consciousness for many decades arguably even frankenstein published in 1818 expresses this basic idea though more modern forms include 2001 a space odyssey 1968 the terminator 1984 i robot 2004 and many more probably most people in western countries have at least heard of these ideas if not watched or read pieces of fiction on the topicso why do most people including many of societys elites ignore strong ai as a serious issue one reason is just that the world is really big and there are many important and notsoimportant issues that demand attention many people think strong ai is too far off and we should focus on nearerterm problems in addition its possible that science fiction itself is part of the reason people may write off ai scenarios as just science fiction as i would have done prior to late 2005 of course this is partly for good reason since depictions of ai in movies are usually very unrealistic often citing hollywood is taken as a thoughtstopping deflection of the possibility of ai getting out of control without much in the way of substantive argument to back up that stance for example lets please keep the discussion firmly within the realm of reason and leave the robot uprisings to hollywood screenwritersas ai progresses i find it hard to imagine that mainstream society will ignore the topic forever perhaps awareness will accrue gradually or perhaps an ai sputnik moment will trigger an avalanche of interest stuart russell expects thatjust as nuclear fusion researchers consider the problem of containment of fusion reactions as one of the primary problems of their field it seems inevitable that issues of control and safety will become central to ai as the field maturesi think its likely that issues of ai policy will be debated heavily in the coming decades although its possible that ai will be like nuclear weapons something that everyone is afraid of but that countries cant stop because of armsrace dynamics so even if ai proceeds slowly theres probably value in thinking more about these issues well ahead of time though i wouldnt consider the counterfactual value of doing so to be astronomical compared with other projects in part because society will pick up the slack as the topic becomes more prominentvarious thinkers have debated the likelihood of a hard takeoff in which a single computer or set of computers rapidly becomes superintelligent on its own compared with a soft takeoff in which society as a whole is transformed by ai in a more distributed continuous fashion the hansonyudkowsky aifoom debate discusses this in great detail the topic has also been considered by many others such as ramez naam vs william hertlingfor a long time i inclined toward yudkowskys vision of ai because i respect his opinions and didnt ponder the details too closely this is also the more prototypical example of rebellious ai in science fiction in early 2014 a friend of mine challenged this view noting that computing power is a severe limitation for humanlevel minds my friend suggested that ai advances would be slow and would diffuse through society rather than remaining in the hands of a single developer team as ive read more ai literature i think this softtakeoff view is pretty likely to be correct science is always a gradual process and almost all ai innovations historically have moved in tiny steps i would guess that even the evolution of humans from their primate ancestors was a soft takeoff in the sense that no single son or daughter was vastly more intelligent than his or her parents the evolution of technology in general has been fairly continuous i probably agree with paul christiano that it is unlikely that there will be rapid discontinuous and unanticipated developments in ai that catapult it to superhuman levelsof course its not guaranteed that ai innovations will diffuse throughout society at some point perhaps governments will take control in the style of the manhattan project and theyll keep the advances secret but even then i expect that the internal advances by the research teams will add cognitive abilities in small steps even if you have a theoretically optimal intelligence algorithm its constrained by computing resources so you either need lots of hardware or approximation hacks or most likely both before it can function effectively in the highdimensional state space of the real world and this again implies a slower trajectory marcus hutters aixitl is an example of a theoretically optimal general intelligence but most ai researchers feel it wont work for artificial general intelligence agi because its astronomically expensive to compute ben goertzel explains i think that tells you something interesting it tells you that dealing with resource restrictions with the boundedness of time and space resources is actually critical to intelligence if you lift the restriction to do things efficiently then ai and agi are trivial problems1in i still don’t get foom robin hanson contendsyes sometimes architectural choices have wider impacts but i was an artificial intelligence researcher for nine years ending twenty years ago and i never saw an architecture choice make a huge difference relative to other reasonable architecture choices for most big systems overall architecture matters a lot less than getting lots of detail rightthis suggests that its unlikely that a single insight will make an astronomical difference to an ais performancesimilarly my experience is that machinelearning algorithms matter less than the data theyre trained on i think this is a general sentiment among data scientists theres a famous slogan that more data is better data a main reason googles performance is so good is that it has so many users that even obscure searches spelling mistakes etc will appear somewhere in its logs but if many performance gains come from data then theyre constrained by hardware which generally grows steadilyhansons i still don’t get foom post continues to be much better at learning the project would instead have to be much better at hundreds of specific kinds of learning which is very hard to do in a small project anders sandberg makes a similar pointas the amount of knowledge grows it becomes harder and harder to keep up and to get an overview necessitating specialization this means that a development project might need specialists in many areas which in turns means that there is a lower size of a group able to do the development in turn this means that it is very hard for a small group to get far ahead of everybody else in all areas simply because it will not have the necessary know how in all necessary areas the solution is of course to hire it but that will enlarge the groupone of the more convincing antifoom arguments is j storrs halls point that an ai improving itself to a world superpower would need to outpace the entire world economy of 7 billion people plus natural resources and physical capital it would do much better to specialize sell its services on the market and acquire powerwealth in the ways that most people do there are plenty of powerhungry people in the world but usually they go to wall street k street or silicon valley rather than trying to build worlddomination plans in their basement why would an ai be different some possibilitiesim skeptical of 1 though i suppose if the ai is very alien these kinds of unknown unknowns become more plausible 2 is an interesting point it seems like a pretty good way to spread yourself as an ai is to become a useful software product that lots of people want to install ie to sell your services on the world market as hall said of course once thats done perhaps the ai could find a way to take over the world maybe it could silently quash competitor ai projects maybe it could hack into computers worldwide via the internet and internet of things as the ai did in the delete series maybe it could devise a way to convince humans to give it access to sensitive control systems as skynet did in terminator 3i find these kinds of scenarios for ai takeover more plausible than a rapidly selfimproving superintelligence indeed even a humanlevel intelligence that can distribute copies of itself over the internet might be able to take control of human infrastructure and hence take over the world no foom is requiredrather than discussing hardvssoft takeoff arguments more here i added discussion to wikipedia where the content will receive greater readership see hard vs soft takeoff in intelligence explosionthe hard vs soft distinction is obviously a matter of degree and maybe how long the process takes isnt the most relevant way to slice the space of scenarios for practical purposes the more relevant question is should we expect control of ai outcomes to reside primarily in the hands of a few seed ai developers in this case altruists should focus on influencing a core group of ai experts or maybe their military corporate leaders or should we expect that society as a whole will play a big role in shaping how ai is developed and used in this case governance structures social dynamics and nontechnical thinkers will play an important role not just in influencing how much ai research happens but also in how the technologies are deployed and incrementally shaped as they matureits possible that one country perhaps the united states or maybe china in later decades will lead the way in ai development especially if the research becomes nationalized when ai technology grows more powerful would this country then take over the world im not sure the united states had a monopoly on nuclear weapons for several years after 1945 but it didnt bomb the soviet union out of existence a country with a monopoly on artificial superintelligence might refrain from destroying its competitors as well on the other hand ai should enable vastly more sophisticated surveillance and control than was possible in the 1940s so a monopoly might be sustainable even without resorting to drastic measures in any case perhaps a country with superintelligence would just economically outcompete the rest of the world rendering military power superfluousbesides a single country taking over the world the other possibility perhaps more likely is that ai is developed in a distributed fashion either openly as is the case in academia today or in secret by governments as is the case with other weapons of mass destructioneven in a softtakeoff case there would come a point at which humans would be unable to keep up with the pace of ai thinking we already see an instance of this with algorithmic stocktrading systems although human traders are still needed for more complex tasks right now the reins of power would have to be transitioned to faster human uploads trusted ais built from scratch or some combination of the two in a slow scenario there might be many intelligent systems at comparable levels of performance maintaining a balance of power at least for a while2 in the long run a singleton seems plausible because computers unlike human kings can reprogram their servants to want to obey their bidding which means that as an agent gains more central authority its not likely to later lose it by internal rebellion only by external aggression also evolutionary competition is not a stable state while a singleton is it seems likely that evolution will eventually lead to a singleton at one point or other—whether because one faction takes over the world or because the competing factions form a stable cooperation agreement—and competition wont return after that happens that said if the singleton is merely a contingent cooperation agreement among factions that still disagree one can imagine that cooperation breaking down in the futuremost of humanitys problems are fundamentally coordination problems selfishness problems if humans were perfectly altruistic we could easily eliminate poverty overpopulation war arms races and other social ills there would remain man vs nature problems but these are increasingly disappearing as technology advances assuming a digital singleton emerges the chances of it going extinct seem very small except due to alien invasions or other external factors because unless the singleton has a very myopic utility function it should consider carefully all the consequences of its actions in contrast to the fools rush in approach that humanity currently takes toward most technological risks due to wanting the benefits of and profits from technology right away and not wanting to lose out to competitors for this reason i suspect that most of george dvorskys 12 ways humanity could destroy the entire solar system are unlikely to happen since most of them presuppose blundering by an advanced earthoriginating intelligence but probably by the time earthoriginating intelligence would be able to carry out interplanetary engineering on a nontrivial scale well already have a digital singleton that thoroughly explores the risks of its actions before executing them that said this might not be true if competing ais begin astroengineering before a singleton is completely formed by the way i should point out that i prefer it if the cosmos isnt successfully colonized because doing so is likely to astronomically multiply sentience and therefore sufferingsometimes its claimed that we should expect a hard takeoff because aidevelopment dynamics will fundamentally change once ais can start improving themselves one stylized way to explain this is via differential equations let it be the intelligence of ais at time tluke muehlhauser reports that the idea of intelligence explosion once machines can start improving themselves ran me over like a train not because it was absurd but because it was clearly true i think this kind of exponential feedback loop is the basis behind many of the intelligenceexplosion argumentsbut lets think about this more carefully whats so special about the point where machines can understand and modify themselves certainly understanding your own source code helps you improve yourself but humans already understand the source code of presentday ais with an eye toward improving it moreover presentday ais are vastly simpler than humanlevel ones will be and presentday ais are far less intelligent than the humans who create them which is easier 1 improving the intelligence of something as smart as you or 2 improving the intelligence of something far dumber 2 is usually easier so if anything ai intelligence should be exploding faster now because it can be lifted up by something vastly smarter than it once ais need to improve themselves theyll have to pull up on their own bootstraps without the guidance of an already existing model of far superior intelligence on which to base their designsas an analogy its harder to produce novel developments if youre the marketleading company its easier if youre a competitor trying to catch up because you know what to aim for and what kinds of designs to reverseengineer ai right now is like a competitor trying to catch up to the market leaderanother way to say this the constants in the differential equations might be important even if human aidevelopment progress is linear that progress might be faster than a slow exponential curve until some point far later where the exponential catches upin any case im cautious of simple differential equations like these why should the rate of intelligence increase be proportional to the intelligence level maybe the problems become much harder at some point maybe the systems become fiendishly complicated such that even small improvements take a long time robin hanson echoes this suggestionstudents get smarter as they learn more and learn how to learn however we teach the most valuable concepts first and the productivity value of schooling eventually falls off instead of exploding to infinity similarly the productivity improvement of factory workers typically slows with time following a power law at the world level average iq scores have increased dramatically over the last century the flynn effect as the world has learned better ways to think and to teach nevertheless iqs have improved steadily instead of accelerating similarly for decades computer and communication aids have made engineers much smarter without accelerating moores law while engineers got smarter their design tasks got harderalso ask yourself this question why do startups exist part of the answer is that they can innovate faster than big companies due to having less institutional baggage and legacy software3 its harder to make radical changes to big systems than small systems of course like the economy does a selfimproving ai could create its own virtual startups to experiment with more radical changes but just as in the economy it might take a while to prove new concepts and then transition old systems to the new and better modelsin discussions of intelligence explosion its common to approximate ai productivity as scaling linearly with number of machines but this may or may not be true depending on the degree of parallelizability empirical examples for humanengineered projects show diminishing returns with more workers and while computers may be better able to partition work due to greater uniformity and speed of communication there will remain some overhead in parallelization some tasks may be inherently nonparalellizable preventing the kinds of everfaster performance that the most extreme explosion scenarios envisagefred brookss no silver bullet paper argued that there is no single development in either technology or management technique which by itself promises even one order of magnitude improvement within a decade in productivity in reliability in simplicity likewise wirths law reminds us of how fast software complexity can grow these points make it seem less plausible that an ai system could rapidly bootstrap itself to superintelligence using just a few key asyetundiscovered insightschollet 2017 notes that even if one part of a system has the ability to recursively selfimprove other parts of the system will inevitably start acting as bottlenecks we might compare this with liebigs law of the minimum growth is dictated not by total resources available but by the scarcest resource limiting factor individual sectors of the human economy can show rapid growth at various times but the growth rate of the entire economy is more limitedeventually there has to be a leveling off of intelligence increase if only due to physical limits on the other hand one argument in favor of differential equations is that the economy has fairly consistently followed exponential trends since humans evolved though the exponential growth rate of todays economy remains small relative to what we typically imagine from an intelligence explosioni think a stronger case for intelligence explosion is the clockspeed difference between biological and digital minds even if ai development becomes very slow in subjective years once ais take it over in objective years ie revolutions around the sun the pace will continue to look blazingly fast but if enough of society is digital by that point including humaninspired subroutines and maybe full digital humans then digital speedup wont give a unique advantage to a single ai project that can then take over the world hence hard takeoff in the sci fi sense still isnt guaranteed also hanson argues that faster minds would produce a onetime jump in economic output but not necessarily a sustained higher rate of growthanother case for intelligence explosion is that intelligence growth might not be driven by the intelligence of a given agent so much as by the collective manhours or machinehours that would become possible with more resources i suspect that ai research could accelerate at least 10 times if it had 1050 times more funding this is not the same as saying i want funding increased in fact i probably want funding decreased to give society more time to sort through these issues the population of digital minds that could be created in a few decades might exceed the biological human population which would imply faster progress if only by numerosity also the digital minds might not need to sleep would focus intently on their assigned tasks etc however once again these are advantages in objective time rather than collective subjective time and these advantages would not be uniquely available to a single firstmover ai project any wealthy and technologically sophisticated group that wasnt too far behind the cutting edge could amplify its ai development in this waya few weeks after writing this section i learned that ch 4 of nick bostroms superintelligence paths dangers strategies contains surprisingly similar content even up to the use of didt as the symbols in a differential equation however bostrom comes down mostly in favor of the likelihood of an intelligence explosion i reply to bostroms arguments in the next sectionnote søren elverlin replies to this section in a video presentation i agree with some of his points and disagree with othersin ch 4 of superintelligence bostrom suggests several factors that might lead to a hard or at least semihard takeoff i dont fully disagree with his points and because these are difficult issues i agree that bostrom might be right but i want to play devils advocate and defend the softtakeoff view ive distilled and paraphrased what i think are 6 core arguments and i reply to each in turn1 there might be a key missing algorithmic insight that allows for dramatic progressmaybe but do we have much precedent for this as far as im aware all individual ai advances and indeed most technology advances in general have not represented astronomical improvements over previous designs maybe connectionist ai systems represented a gamechanging improvement relative to symbolic ai for messy tasks like vision but im not sure how much of an improvement they represented relative to the best alternative technologies after all neural networks are in some sense just fancier forms of preexisting statistical methods like logistic regression and even neural networks came in stages with the perceptron multilayer networks backpropagation recurrent networks deep networks etc the most groundbreaking machinelearning advances may reduce error rates by a half or something which may be commercially very important but this is not many orders of magnitude as hardtakeoff scenarios tend to assumeoutside of ai the internet changed the world but it was an accumulation of many insights facebook has had massive impact but it too was built from many small parts and grew in importance slowly as its size increased microsoft became a virtual monopoly in the 1990s but perhaps more for business than technology reasons and its power in the software industry at large is probably not growing google has a quasimonopoly on web search kicked off by the success of pagerank but most of its improvements have been small and gradual google has grown very powerful but it hasnt maintained a permanent advantage that would allow it to take over the software industryacquiring nuclear weapons might be the closest example of a single discrete step that most dramatically changes a countrys position but this may be an outlier maybe other advances in weaponry arrows guns etc historically have had somewhat dramatic effectsbostrom doesnt present specific arguments for thinking that a few crucial insights may produce radical jumps he suggests that we might not notice a systems improvements until it passes a threshold but this seems absurd because at least the ai developers would need to be intimately acquainted with the ais performance while not strictly accurate theres a slogan you cant improve what you cant measure maybe the ais progress wouldnt make world headlines but the academicindustrial community would be well aware of nontrivial breakthroughs and the ai developers would live and breathe performance numbers2 once an ai passes a threshold it might be able to absorb vastly more content eg by reading the internet that was previously inaccessibleabsent other concurrent improvements im doubtful this would produce takeovertheworld superintelligence because the worlds current superintelligence namely humanity as a whole already has read most of the internet indeed has written it i guess humans havent read all automatically generated text or vast streams of numerical data but the insights gleaned purely from reading such material would be low without doing more sophisticated data mining and learning on top of it and presumably such data mining would have already been in progress well before bostroms hypothetical ai learned how to readin any case i doubt reading with understanding is such an allornothing activity that it can suddenly turn on once the ai achieves a certain ability level as bostrom says p 71 reading with the comprehension of a 10yearold is probably aicomplete ie requires solving the general ai problem so assuming that you can switch on reading ability with one improvement is equivalent to assuming that a single insight can produce astronomical gains in ai performance which we discussed above if thats not true and if before the ai system with 10yearold reading ability was an ai system with a 6yearold reading ability why wouldnt that ai have already devoured the internet and before that why wouldnt a protoreader have devoured a version of the internet that had been processed to make it easier for a machine to understand and so on until we get to the presentday textrunner system that bostrom cites which is already devouring the internet it doesnt make sense that massive amounts of content would only be added after lots of improvements commercial incentives tend to yield exactly the opposite effect converting the system to a largescale product when even modest gains appear because these may be enough to snatch a market advantagethe fundamental point is that i dont think theres a crucial set of components to general intelligence that all need to be in place before the whole thing works its hard to evolve systems that require all components to be in place at once which suggests that human general intelligence probably evolved gradually i expect its possible to get partial agi with partial implementations of the components of general intelligence and the components can gradually be made more general over time components that are lacking can be supplemented by humanbased computation and narrowai hacks until more general solutions are discovered compare with minimum viable products and agile software development as a result society should be upended by partial agi innovations many times over the coming decades well before fully humanlevel agi is finished3 once a system proves its mettle by attaining humanlevel intelligence funding for hardware could multiplyi agree that funding for ai could multiply manyfold due to a sudden change in popular attention or political dynamics but im thinking of something like a factor of 10 or maybe 50 in an allout cold warstyle arms race a factorof50 boost in hardware isnt obviously that important if before there was one humanlevel ai there would now be 50 in any case i expect the sputnik moments for ai to happen well before it achieves a human level of ability companies and militaries arent stupid enough not to invest massively in an ai with almosthuman intelligence4 once the human level of intelligence is reached researchers may work harder and more researchers may be recruitedas with hardware above i would expect these shit hits the fan moments to happen before fully humanlevel ai in any case5 at some point the ais selfimprovements would dominate those of human engineers leading to exponential growthi discussed this in the intelligence explosion section above a main point is that we see many other systems such as the world economy or moores law that also exhibit positive feedback and hence exponential growth but these arent fooming at an astounding rate its not clear why an ais selfimprovement which resembles economic growth and other complex phenomena should suddenly explode faster in subjective time than humanitys existing recursiveself improvement of its intelligence via digital computationon the other hand maybe the difference between subjective and objective time is important if a humanlevel ai could think say 10000 times faster than a human then assuming linear scaling it would be worth 10000 engineers by the time of humanlevel ai i expect there would be far more than 10000 ai developers on earth but given enough hardware the ai could copy itself manyfold until its subjective time far exceeded that of human experts the speed and copiability advantages of digital minds seem perhaps the strongest arguments for a takeoff that happens rapidly relative to human observers note that as hanson said above this digital speedup might be just a onetime boost rather than a permanently higher rate of growth but even the onetime boost could be enough to radically alter the power dynamics of humans visàvis machines that said there should be plenty of slightly subhuman ais by this time and maybe they could fill some speed gaps on behalf of biological humansin general its a mistake to imagine humanlevel ai against a backdrop of our current world thats like imagining a tyrannosaurus rex in a human city rather the world will look very different by the time humanlevel ai arrives before ai can exceed human performance in all domains it will exceed human performance in many narrow domains gradually and these narrowdomain ais will help humans respond quickly for example a narrow ai thats an expert at military planning based on war games can help humans with possible military responses to rogue aismany of the intermediate steps on the path to general ai will be commercially useful and thus should diffuse widely in the meanwhile as user hungryhobo noted if you had a near human level ai odds are everything that could be programmed into it at the start to help it with software development is already going to be part of the suites of tools for helping normal human programmers even if ai research becomes nationalized and confidential its developers should still have access to almosthumanlevel digitalspeed ai tools which should help smooth the transition for instance bostrom mentions how in the 2010 flash crash box 2 p 17 a highspeed positivefeedback spiral was terminated by a highspeed circuit breaker this is already an example where problems happening faster than humans could comprehend them were averted due to solutions happening faster than humans could comprehend them see also the discussion of tripwires in superintelligence p 137conversely many globally disruptive events may happen well before fully human ai arrives since even subhuman ai may be prodigiously powerful6 even when the outside world has a greater total amount of relevant research capability than any one project the optimization power of the project might be more important than that of the world since much of the outside worlds capability is not be focused on the particular system in question hence the project might take off and leave the world behind box 4 p 75what one makes of this argument depends on how many people are needed to engineer how much progress the watson system that played on jeopardy required 15 people over 4 years4 given the existing tools of the rest of the world at that time which had been developed by millions indeed billions of other people watson was a much smaller leap forward than that needed to give a general intelligence a takeovertheworld advantage how many more people would be required to achieve such a radical leap in intelligence this seems to be a main point of contention in the debate between believers in soft vs hard takeoffcan we get insight into how hard general intelligence is based on neuroscience is the human brain fundamentally simple or complexjeff hawkins andrew ng and others speculate that the brain may have one fundamental algorithm for intelligence deep learning in the cortical column this idea gains plausibility from the brains plasticity for instance blind people can appropriate the visual cortex for auditory processing artificial neural networks can be used to classify any kind of input not just visual and auditory but even highly abstract like features about creditcard fraud or stock pricesmaybe theres one fundamental algorithm for input classification but this doesnt imply one algorithm for all that the brain does beyond the cortical column the brain has many specialized structures that seem to perform very specialized functions such as reward learning in the basal ganglia fear processing in the amygdala etc of course its not clear how essential all of these parts are or how easy it would be to replace them with artificial components performing the same basic functionsone argument for faster agi takeoffs is that humans have been able to learn many sophisticated things eg advanced mathematics music writing programming without requiring any genetic changes and what we now know doesnt seem to represent any kind of limit to what we could know with more learning the human collection of cognitive algorithms is very flexible which seems to belie claims that all intelligence requires specialized designs on the other hand even if human genes havent changed much in the last 10000 years human culture has evolved substantially and culture undergoes slow trialanderror evolution in similar ways as genes do so one could argue that human intellectual achievements are not fully general but rely on a vast amount of specialized evolved content just as a single random human isolated from society probably couldnt develop general relativity on his own in a lifetime so a single random humanlevel agi probably couldnt either culture is the new genome and it progresses slowlymoreover some scholars believe that certain human abilities such as language are very essentially based on genetic hardwiringthe approach taken by chomsky and marr toward understanding how our minds achieve what they do is as different as can be from behaviorism the emphasis here is on the internal structure of the system that enables it to perform a task rather than on external association between past behavior of the system and the environment the goal is to dig into the black box that drives the system and describe its inner workings much like how a computer scientist would explain how a cleverly designed piece of software works and how it can be executed on a desktop computerchomsky himself notestheres a fairly recent book by a very good cognitive neuroscientist randy gallistel and king arguing in my view plausibly that neuroscience developed kind of enthralled to associationism and related views of the way humans and animals work and as a result theyve been looking for things that have the properties of associationist psychologymany parts of the human body like the digestive system or bonesmuscles are extremely complex and finetuned yet few people argue that their development is controlled by learning so its not implausible that a lot of the brains basic architecture could be similarly hardcodedtypically agi researchers express scorn for manually tuned software algorithms that dont rely on fully general learning but chomskys stance challenges that sentiment if chomsky is right then a good portion of human general intelligence is finely tuned hardcoded software of the sort that we see in nonai branches of software engineering and this view would suggest a slower agi takeoff because time and experimentation are required to tune all the detailed specific algorithms of intelligencea fullfledged superintelligence probably requires very complex design but it may be possible to build a seed ai that would recursively selfimprove toward superintelligence alan turing proposed this in his 1950 computing machinery and intelligenceinstead of trying to produce a programme to simulate the adult mind why not rather try to produce one which simulates the childs if this were then subjected to an appropriate course of education one would obtain the adult brain presumably the child brain is something like a notebook as one buys it from the stationers rather little mechanism and lots of blank sheets mechanism and writing are from our point of view almost synonymous our hope is that there is so little mechanism in the child brain that something like it can be easily programmedanimal development appears to be at least somewhat robust based on the fact that the growing organisms are often functional despite a few genetic mutations and variations in prenatal and postnatal environments such variations may indeed make an impact eg healthier development conditions tend to yield more physically attractive adults but most humans mature successfully over a wide range of input conditionson the other hand an argument against the simplicity of development is the immense complexity of our dna it accumulated over billions of years through vast numbers of evolutionary experiments its not clear that human engineers could perform enough measurements to tune ontogenetic parameters of a seed ai in a short period of time and even if the parameter settings worked for early development they would probably fail for later development rather than a seed ai developing into an adult all at once designers would develop the ai in small steps since each next stage of development would require significant tuning to get rightthink about how much effort is required for human engineers to build even relatively simple systems for example i think the number of developers who work on microsoft office is in the thousands microsoft office is complex but is still far simpler than a mammalian brain brains have lots of little parts that have been finetuned that kind of complexity requires immense work by software developers to create the main counterargument is that there may be a simple metaalgorithm that would allow an ai to bootstrap to the point where it could finetune all the details on its own without requiring human inputs this might be the case but my guess is that any elegant solution would be hugely expensive computationally for instance biological evolution was able to finetune the human brain but it did so with immense amounts of computing power over millions of yearsa common analogy for the gulf between superintelligence vs humans is that between humans vs chimpanzees in consciousness explained daniel dennett mentions pp 189190 how our hominid ancestors had brains roughly four times the volume as those of chimps but roughly the same in structure this might incline one to imagine that brain size alone could yield superintelligence maybe wed just need to quadruple human brains once again to produce superintelligent humans if so wouldnt this imply a hard takeoff since quadrupling hardware is relatively easybut in fact as dennett explains the quadrupling of brain size from chimps to prehumans completed before the advent of language cooking agriculture etc in other words the main foom of humans came from culture rather than brain size per se from software in addition to hardware yudkowsky seems to agree humans have around four times the brain volume of chimpanzees but the difference between us is probably mostly brainlevel cognitive algorithmsbut cultural changes software arguably progress a lot more slowly than hardware the intelligence of human society has grown exponentially but its a slow exponential and rarely have there been innovations that allowed one group to quickly overpower everyone else within the same region of the world between isolated regions of the world the situation was sometimes different eg europeans with maxim guns overpowering africans because of very different levels of industrializationsome including owen cottonbarratt and toby ord have argued that even if we think soft takeoffs are more likely there may be higher value in focusing on hardtakeoff scenarios because these are the cases in which society would have the least forewarning and the fewest people working on ai altruism issues this is a reasonable point but i would add thatin any case the hardsoft distinction is not binary and maybe the best place to focus is on scenarios where humanlevel ai takes over on a time scale of a few years timescales of months days or hours strike me as pretty improbable unless say skynet gets control of nuclear weaponsin superintelligence nick bostrom suggests ch 4 p 64 that most preparations undertaken before onset of a slow takeoff would be rendered obsolete as better solutions would gradually become visible in the light of the dawning era toby ord uses the term nearsightedness to refer to the ways in which research too far in advance of an issues emergence may not as useful as research when more is known about the issue ord contrasts this with benefits of starting early including coursesetting i think ords counterpoints argue against the contention that early work wouldnt matter that much in a slow takeoff some of how society responded to ai surpassing human intelligence might depend on early frameworks and memes for instance consider the lingering impact of terminator imagery on almost any presentday popularmedia discussion of ai risk some fundamental work would probably not be overthrown by later discoveries for instance algorithmiccomplexity bounds of key algorithms were discovered decades ago but will remain relevant until intelligence dies out possibly billions of years from now some nontechnical policy and philosophy work would be less obsoleted by changing developments and some ai preparation would be relevant both in the short term and the long term slow ai takeoff to reach the human level is already happening and more minds should be exploring these questions well in advancemaking a related though slightly different point bostrom argues in superintelligence ch 5 pp 8586 that individuals might play more of a role in cases where elites and governments underestimate the significance of ai activists seeking maximum expected impact may therefore wish to focus most of their planning on scenarios where governments come late to the game even if they believe that scenarios in which big players end up calling all the shots are more probable again i would qualify this with the note that we shouldnt confuse acting as if governments will come late with believing they actually will come late when thinking about most likely future scenarioseven if one does wish to bet on lowprobability highimpact scenarios of fast takeoff and governmental neglect this doesnt speak to whether or how we should push on takeoff speed and governmental attention themselves following are a few considerationstakeoff speedamount of governmentpopular attention to aione of the strongest arguments for hard takeoff is this one by yudkowskythe distance from village idiot to einstein is tiny in the space of brain designsor as scott alexander put itit took evolution twenty million years to go from cows with sharp horns to hominids with sharp spears it took only a few tens of thousands of years to go from hominids with sharp spears to moderns with nuclear weaponsi think we shouldnt take relative evolutionary timelines at face value because most of the previous 20 million years of mammalian evolution werent focused on improving human intelligence most of the evolutionary selection pressure was directed toward optimizing other traits in contrast cultural evolution places greater emphasis on intelligence because that trait is more important in human society than it is in most animal fitness landscapesstill the overall point is important the tweaks to a brain needed to produce humanlevel intelligence may not be huge compared with the designs needed to produce chimp intelligence but the differences in the behaviors of the two systems when placed in a sufficiently informationrich environment are hugenonetheless i incline toward thinking that the transition from humanlevel ai to an ai significantly smarter than all of humanity combined would be somewhat gradual requiring at least years if not decades because the absolute scale of improvements needed would still be immense and would be limited by hardware capacity but if hardware becomes many orders of magnitude more efficient than it is today then things could indeed move more rapidlyanother important criticism of the village idiot point is that it lacks context while a village idiot in isolation will not produce rapid progress toward superintelligence one einstein plus a million village idiots working for him can produce ai progress much faster than one einstein alone the narrowintelligence software tools that we build are dumber than village idiots in isolation but collectively when deployed in thoughtful ways by smart humans they allow humans to achieve much more than einstein by himself with only pencil and paper this observation weakens the idea of a phase transition when humanlevel ai is developed because villageidiotlevel ais in the hands of humans will already be achieving superhuman levels of performance if we think of human intelligence as the number 1 and humanlevel ai that can build smarter ai as the number 2 then rather than imagining a transition from 1 to 2 at one crucial point we should think of our dumb software tools as taking us to 11 then 12 then 13 and so on my thinking on this point was inspired by ramez naammany of the most impressive ai achievements of the 2010s were improvements at game play both video games like atari games and boardcard games like go and poker some people infer from these accomplishments that agi may not be far off i think performance in these simple games doesnt give much evidence that a worldconquering agi could arise within a decade or twoa main reason is that most of the games at which ai has excelled have had simple rules and a limited set of possible actions at each turn russell and norvig 2003 pp 16162 for ai researchers the abstract nature of games makes them an appealing subject for study the state of a game is easy to represent and agents are usually restricted to a small number of actions whose outcomes are defined by precise rules in games like space invaders or go you can see the entire world at once and represent it as a twodimensional grid5 you can also consider all possible actions at a given turn for example alphagos policy networks gave a probability value for each possible legal move ie the output of the network is as large as the board as summarized by burger 2016 likewise deepminds deep qnetwork for playing atari games had a single output for each valid action mnih et al 2015 p 530in contrast the state space of the world is enormous heterogeneous not easily measured and not easily represented in a simple twodimensional grid plus the number of possible actions that one can take at any given moment is almost unlimited for instance even just considering actions of the form print to the screen a string of uppercase or lowercase alphabetical characters fewer than 50 characters long the number of possibilities for what text to print out is larger than the number of atoms in the observable universe6 these problems seem to require hierarchical world models and hierarchical planning of actions—allowing for abstraction of complexity into simplified and highlevel conceptualizations—as well as the data structures learning algorithms and simulation capabilities on which such world models and plans can be basedsome people may be impressed that alphago uses intuition ie deep neural networks like human players do and doesnt rely purely on bruteforce search and handcrafted heuristic evaluation functions the way that deep blue did to win at chess but the idea that computers can have intuition is nothing new since thats what most machinelearning classifiers are aboutmachine learning especially supervised machine learning is very popular these days compared against other aspects of ai perhaps this is because unlike most other parts of ai machine learning can easily be commercialized but even if visual auditory and other sensory recognition can be replicated by machine learning this doesnt get us to agi in my opinion the hard part of agi or at least the part we havent made as much progress on is how to hook together various narrowai modules and abilities into a more generally intelligent agent that can figure out what abilities to deploy in various contexts in pursuit of higherlevel goals hierarchical planning in complex worlds rich semantic networks and general common sense in various flavors still seem largely absent from many stateoftheart ai systems as far as i can tell i dont think these are problems that you can just bypass by scaling up deep reinforcement learning or somethingkaufman 2017a says regarding a conversation with professor bryce wiedenbeck bryce thinks there are deep questions about what intelligence really is that we dont understand yet and that as we make progress on those questions well develop very different sorts of machinelearning systems if something like todays deep learning is still a part of what we eventually end up with its more likely to be something that solves specific problems than as a critical component personally i think deep learning or something functionally analogous to it is likely to remain a big component of future ai systems two lines of evidence for this view are that 1 supervised machine learning has been a cornerstone of ai for decades and 2 animal brains including the human cortex seem to rely crucially on something like deep learning for sensory processing however i agree with bryce that there remain big parts of human intelligence that arent captured by even a scaled up version of deep learningi also largely agree with michael littmans expectations as described by kaufman 2017b i asked him what he thought of the idea that to we could get agi with current techniques primarily deep neural nets and reinforcement learning without learning anything new about how intelligence works or how to implement it he didnt think this was possible and believes there are deep conceptual issues we still need to get a handle onmerritt 2017 quotes stuart russell as saying that modern neural nets lack the expressive power of programming languages and declarative semantics that make database systems logic programming and knowledge systems useful russell believes we have at least half a dozen major breakthroughs to come before we get to aiyudkowsky 2016a discusses some interesting insights from alphagos matches against lee sedol and deepmind more generally he saysalphago’s core is built around a similar machine learning technology to deepmind’s atariplaying system – the single untweaked program that was able to learn superhuman play on dozens of different atari games just by looking at the pixels without specialization for each particular game in the atari case we didn’t see a bunch of different companies producing gameplayers for all the different varieties of game the atari case was an example of an event that robin hanson called “architecture” and doubted and that i called “insight” because of their big architectural insight deepmind didn’t need to bring in lots of different human experts at all the different atari games to train their universal atari player deepmind just tossed all preexisting expertise because it wasn’t formatted in a way their insightful ai system could absorb and besides it was a lot easier to just recreate all the expertise from scratch using their universal atarilearning architecturei agree with yudkowsky that there are domains where a new general tool renders previous specialized tools obsolete all at once howeveryudkowsky 2016a continuesso far as i know alphago wasn’t built in collaboration with any of the commercial companies that built their own goplaying programs for sale the october architecture was simple and so far as i know incorporated very little in the way of all the particular tweaks that had built up the power of the best opensource go programs of the time judging by the october architecture after their big architectural insight deepmind mostly started over in the details though they did reuse the widely known core insight of monte carlo tree search deepmind didn’t need to trade with any other go companies or be part of an economy that traded polished cognitive modules because deepmind’s big insight let them leapfrog over all the detail work of their competitorsthis is a good point but i think its mainly a function of the limited complexity of the go problem with the exception of learning from human play alphago didnt require massive inputs of messy realworld data to succeed because its world was so simple go is the kind of problem where we would expect a single system to be able to perform well without trading for cognitive assistance realworld problems are more likely to depend upon external ai systems—eg when doing a web search for information no simple ai system that runs on just a few machines will reproduce the massive data or extensively finetuned algorithms of google search for the foreseeable future google search will always be an external polished cognitive module that needs to be traded for although google search is free for limited numbers of queries the same is true for many other cloud services especially those reliant upon huge amounts of data or specialized domain knowledge we see lots of specialization and trading of nonai cognitive modules such as hardware components software applications amazon web services etc and of course simple ais will for a long time depend upon the human economy to provide material goods and services including electricity cooling buildings security guards national defense etcestimating how long a software project will take to complete is notoriously difficult even if ive completed many similar coding tasks before when im asked to estimate the time to complete a new coding project my estimate is often wrong by a factor of 2 and sometimes wrong by a factor of 4 or even 10 insofar as the development of agi or other big technologies like nuclear fusion is a big software or more generally engineering project its unsurprising that wed see similarly dramatic failures of estimation on timelines for these biggerscale achievementsa corollary is that we should maintain some modesty about agi timelines and takeoff speeds if say 100 years is your median estimate for the time until some agreedupon form of agi then theres a reasonable chance youll be off by a factor of 2 suggesting agi within 50 to 200 years and you might even be off by a factor of 4 suggesting agi within 25 to 400 years similar modesty applies for estimates of takeoff speed from humanlevel agi to superhuman agi although i think we can largely rule out extreme takeoff speeds like achieving performance far beyond human abilities within hours or days based on fundamental reasoning about the computational complexity of whats required to achieve superintelligencemy bias is generally to assume that a given technology will take longer to develop than what you hear about in the media a because of the planning fallacy and b because those who make more audacious claims are more interesting to report about believers in the singularity are not necessarily wrong about whats technically possible in the long term though sometimes they are but the reason enthusiastic singularitarians are considered crazy by more mainstream observers is that singularitarians expect change much faster than is realistic ai turned out to be much harder than the dartmouth conference participants expected likewise nanotech is progressing slower and more incrementally than the starryeyed proponents predictedmany naturelovers are charmed by the behavior of animals but find computers and robots to be cold and mechanical conversely some computer enthusiasts may find biology to be soft and boring compared with digital creations however the two domains share a surprising amount of overlap ideas of optimal control locomotion kinematics visual processing system regulation foraging behavior planning reinforcement learning etc have been fruitfully shared between biology and robotics neuroscientists sometimes look to the latest developments in ai to guide their theoretical models and ai researchers are often inspired by neuroscience such as with neural networks and in deciding what cognitive functionality to implementi think its helpful to see animals as being intelligent robots organic life has a wide diversity from unicellular organisms through humans and potentially beyond and so too can robotic life the rigid conceptual boundary that many people maintain between life and machines is not warranted by the underlying science of how the two types of systems work different types of intelligence may sometimes converge on the same basic kinds of cognitive operations and especially from a functional perspective when we look at what the systems can do rather than how they do it it seems to me intuitive that humanlevel robots would deserve humanlevel treatment even if their underlying algorithms were quite dissimilarwhether robot algorithms will in fact be dissimilar from those in human brains depends on how much biological inspiration the designers employ and how convergent humantype mind design is for being able to perform robotic tasks in a computationally efficient manner some classical robotics algorithms rely mostly on mathematical problem definition and optimization other modern robotics approaches use biologically plausible reinforcement learning andor evolutionary selection in one youtube video about robotics i saw that someone had written a comment to the effect that this shows that life needs an intelligent designer to be created the irony is that some of the best robotics techniques use evolutionary algorithms of course there are theists who say god used evolution but intervened at a few points and that would be an apt description of evolutionary roboticsthe distinction between ai and agi is somewhat misleading because it may incline one to believe that general intelligence is somehow qualitatively different from simpler ai in fact theres no sharp distinction there are just different machines whose abilities have different degrees of generality a critic of this claim might reply that bacteria would never have invented calculus my response is as follows most people couldnt have invented calculus from scratch either but over a long enough period of time eventually the collection of humans produced enough cultural knowledge to make the development possible likewise if you put bacteria on a planet long enough they too may develop calculus by first evolving into more intelligent animals who can then go on to do mathematics the difference here is a matter of degree the simpler machines that bacteria are take vastly longer to accomplish a given complex taskjust as earths history saw a plethora of animal designs before the advent of humans so i expect a wide assortment of animallike and plantlike robots to emerge in the coming decades well before humanlevel ai indeed weve already had basic robots for many decades or arguably even millennia these will grow gradually more sophisticated and as we converge on robots with the intelligence of birds and mammals ai and robotics will become dinnertable conversation topics of course i dont expect the robots to have the same sets of skills as existing animals deep blue had chessplaying abilities beyond any animal while in other domains it was less efficacious than a blade of grass robots can mix and match cognitive and motor abilities without strict regard for the order in which evolution created themand of course humans are robots too when i finally understood this around 2009 it was one of the biggest paradigm shifts of my life if i picture myself as a robot operating on an environment the world makes a lot more sense i also find this perspective can be therapeutic to some extent if i experience an unpleasant emotion i think about myself as a robot whose cognition has been temporarily afflicted by a negative stimulus and reinforcement process i then think how the robot has other cognitive processes that can counteract the suffering computations and prevent them from amplifying the ability to see myself from the outside as a thirdperson series of algorithms helps deflate the impact of unpleasant experiences because its easier to observe not judge when viewing a system in mechanistic terms compare with dialectical behavior therapy and mindfulnesswhen we use machines to automate a repetitive manual task formerly done by humans we talk about getting the task done automatically and for free because we say that no one has to do the work anymore of course this isnt strictly true the computerrobot now has to do the work maybe what we actually mean is that no one is going to get bored doing the work and we dont have to pay that worker high wages when intelligent humans do boring tasks its a waste of their spare cpu cyclessometimes we adopt a similar mindset about automation toward superintelligent machines in speculations concerning the first ultraintelligent machine 1965 i j good wrotelet an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever makeignoring the question of whether these future innovations are desirable we can ask does all ai design work after humans come for free it comes for free in the sense that humans arent doing it but the ais have to do it and it takes a lot of mental work on their parts given that theyre at least as intelligent as humans i think it doesnt make sense to picture them as mindless automatons rather they would have rich inner lives even if those inner lives have a very different nature than our own maybe they wouldnt experience the same effortfulness that humans do when innovating but even this isnt clear because measuring your effort in order to avoid spending too many resources on a task without payoff may be a useful design feature of ai minds too when we picture ourselves as robots along with our ai creations we can see that we are just one point along a spectrum of the growth of intelligence unicellular organisms when they evolved the first multicellular organism could likewise have said thats the last innovation we need to make the rest comes for freemovies typically portray rebellious robots or ais as the bad guys who need to be stopped by heroic humans this dichotomy plays on our usvsthem intuitions which favor our tribe against the evil alienlooking outsiders we see similar dynamics at play to a lesser degree when people react negatively against foreigners stealing our jobs or asians who are outcompeting us people dont want their kind to be replaced by another kind that has an advantagebut when we think about the situation from the ais perspective we might feel differently anthropomorphizing an ais thoughts is a recipe for trouble but regardless of the specific cognitive operations we can see at a high level that the ai feels in at least a poetic sense that what its trying to accomplish is the most important thing in the world and its trying to figure out how it can do that in the face of obstacles isnt this just what we do ourselvesthis is one reason it helps to really internalize the fact that we are robots too we have a variety of reward signals that drive us in various directions and we execute behavior aiming to increase those rewards many modernday robots have much simpler reward structures and so may seem more dull and less important than humans but its not clear this will remain true forever since navigating in a complex world probably requires a lot of specialcase heuristics and intermediate rewards at least until enough computing power becomes available for more systematic and thorough modelbased planning and action selectionsuppose an ai hypothetically eliminated humans and took over the world it would develop an array of robot assistants of various shapes and sizes to help it optimize the planet these would perform simple and complex tasks would interact with each other and would share information with the central ai command from an abstract perspective some of these dynamics might look like ecosystems in the present day except that they would lack interorganism competition other parts of the ais infrastructure might look more industrial depending on the ais goals perhaps it would be more effective to employ nanotechnology and programmable matter rather than macroscale robots the ai would develop virtual scientists to learn more about physics chemistry computer hardware and so on they would use experimental laboratory and measurement techniques but could also probe depths of structure that are only accessible via largescale computation digital engineers would plan how to begin colonizing the solar system they would develop designs for optimizing matter to create more computing power and for ensuring that those helper computing systems remained under control the ai would explore the depths of mathematics and ai theory proving beautiful theorems that it would value highly at least instrumentally the ai and its helpers would proceed to optimize the galaxy and beyond fulfilling their grandest hopes and dreamswhen phrased this way we might think that a rogue ai would not be so bad yes it would kill humans but compared against the ais vast future intelligence humans would be comparable to the ants on a field that get crushed when an art gallery is built on that land most people dont have qualms about killing a few ants to advance human goals an analogy of this sort is discussed in artificial intelligence a modern approach perhaps the ai analogy suggests a need to revise our ethical attitudes toward arthropods that said i happen to think that in this case ants on the whole benefit from the art gallerys construction because ant lives contain so much sufferingsome might object that sufficiently mathematical ais would not feel the happiness of accomplishing their dreams they wouldnt be conscious because they wouldnt have the high degree of network connectivity that human brains embody whether we agree with this assessment depends on how broadly we define consciousness and feelings to me it appears chauvinistic to adopt a view according to which an agent that has vastly more domaingeneral intelligence and agency than you is still not conscious in a morally relevant sense this seems to indicate a lack of openness to the diversity of mindspace what if you had grown up with the cognitive architecture of this different mind wouldnt you care about your goals then wouldnt you plead with agents of other mind constitution to consider your values and interests tooin any event its possible that the first superhuman intelligence will consist in a brain upload rather than a bottomup ai and most of us would regard this as consciouseven if we would care about a rogue ai for its own sake and the sakes of its vast helper minions this doesnt mean rogue ai is a good idea were likely to have different values from the ai and the ai would not by default advance our values without being programmed to do so of course one could allege that privileging some values above others is chauvinistic in a similar way as privileging some intelligence architectures is but if we dont care more about some values than others we wouldnt have any reason to prefer any outcome over any other outcome technically speaking there are other possibilities besides privileging our values or being indifferent to all events for instance we could privilege equally any values held by some actual agent not just random hypothetical values and in this case we wouldnt have a preference between the rogue ai and humans but we would have a preference for one of those over something arbitrarythere are many values that would not necessarily be respected by a rogue ai most people care about their own life their children their neighborhood the work they produce and so on people may intrinsically value art knowledge religious devotion play humor etc yudkowsky values complex challenges and worries that many rogue ais while they would study the depths of physics mathematics engineering and maybe even sociology might spend most of their computational resources on routine mechanical operations that he would find boring of course the robots implementing those repetitive operations might not agree as hedonic treader noted think how much money and time people spend on having relatively repetitive sexual experiences its just mechanical animalistic idiosyncratic behavior yes there are variations but lets be honest the core of the thing is always essentially the samein my case i care about reducing and preventing suffering and i would not be pleased with a rogue ai that ignored the suffering its actions might entail even if it was fulfilling its innermost purpose in life but would a rogue ai produce much suffering beyond earth the next section explores furtherin popular imagination takeover by a rogue ai would end suffering and happiness on earth by killing all biological life it would also so the story goes end suffering and happiness on other planets as the ai mined them for resources thus looking strictly at the suffering dimension of things wouldnt a rogue ai imply less longterm sufferingnot necessarily because while the ai might destroy biological life perhaps after taking samples saving specimens and conducting lab experiments for future use it would create a bounty of digital life some containing goal systems that we would recognize as having moral relevance nonupload ais would probably have less empathy than humans because some of the factors that led to the emergence of human empathy such as parenting would not apply to itone toy example of a rogue ai is a paperclip maximizer this conception of an uncontrolled ai7 is almost certainly too simplistic and perhaps misguided since its far from obvious that the ai would be a unified agent with a single crisply specified utility function still until people develop more realistic scenarios for rogue ai it can be helpful to imagine what a paperclip maximizer would do to our future light conefollowing are some madeup estimates of how much suffering might result from a typical rogue ai in arbitrary units suffering is represented as a negative number and prevented suffering is positivewhat about for a humaninspired ai again here are madeup numbersperhaps some ais would not want to expand the multiverse assuming this is even possible for instance if they had a minimizing goal function eg eliminate cancer they would want to shrink the multiverse in this case the physicsbased suffering number would go from 100 to something positive say 50 if say its twice as easy to expand as to shrink i would guess that minimizers are less common than maximizers but i dont know how much plausibly a sophisticated ai would have components of its goal system in both directions because the combination of pleasure and pain seems to be more successful than either in isolationanother consideration is the unpleasant possibility that humans might get ai value loading almost right but not exactly right leading to immense suffering as a result for example suppose the ais designers wanted to create tons of simulated human lives to reduce astronomical waste but when the ai actually created those human simulations they werent perfect replicas of biological humans perhaps because the ai skimped on detail in order to increase efficiency the imperfectly simulated humans might suffer from mental disorders might go crazy due to being in alien environments and so on does work on ai safety increase or decrease the risk of outcomes like these on the one hand the probability of this outcome is near zero for an agi with completely random goals such as a literal paperclip maximizer since paperclips are very far from humans in designspace the risk of accidentally creating suffering humans is higher for an almostfriendly ai that goes somewhat awry and then becomes uncontrolled preventing it from being shut off a successfully controlled agi seems to have lower risk of a bad outcome since humans should recognize the problem and fix it so the risk of this type of dystopic outcome may be highest in a middle ground where ai safety is sufficiently advanced to yield ai goals in the ballpark of human values but not advanced enough to ensure that human values remain in controlthe above analysis has huge error bars and maybe other considerations that i havent mentioned dominate everything else this question needs much more exploration because it has implications for whether those who care mostly about reducing suffering should focus on mitigating ai risk or if other projects have higher priorityeven if suffering reducers dont focus on conventional ai safety they should probably remain active in the ai field because there are many other ways to make an impact for instance just increasing dialogue on this topic may illuminate positivesum opportunities for different value systems to each get more of what they want suffering reducers can also point out the possible ethical importance of lowerlevel suffering subroutines which are not currently a concern even to most ailiterate audiences and so on there are probably many dimensions on which to make constructive positivesum contributionsalso keep in mind that even if suffering reducers do encourage ai safety they could try to push toward ai designs that if they did fail would produce less bad uncontrolled outcomes for instance getting ai control wrong and ending up with a minimizer would be vastly preferable to getting control wrong and ending up with a maximizer there may be many other dimensions along which even if the probability of control failure is the same the outcome if control fails is preferable to other outcomes of control failureconsider a superintelligent ai that uses moderately intelligent robots to build factories and carry out other physical tasks that cant be preprogrammed in a simple way would these robots feel pain in a similar fashion as animals do at least if they use somewhat similar algorithms as animals for navigating environments avoiding danger etc its plausible that such robots would feel something akin to stress fear and other drives to change their current state when things were going wrongalvarado et al 2002 argue that emotion may play a central role in intelligence regarding computers and robots the authors say p 4 including components for cognitive processes but not emotional processes implies that the two are dissociable but it is likely they are not dissociable in humans the authors also p 1 quote daniel dennett from a source that doesnt seem to be available online recent empirical and theoretical work in cognitive science strongly suggests that emotions are so valuable in the realtime control of our rationality that an embodied robot would be well advised to be equipped with artificial emotionsthe specific responses that such robots would have to specific stimuli or situations would differ from the responses that an evolved selfish animal would have for example a well programmed helper robot would not hesitate to put itself in danger in order to help other robots or otherwise advance the goals of the ai it was serving perhaps the robots physical painfear subroutines could be shut off in cases of altruism for the greater good or else its decision processes could just override those selfish considerations when making choices requiring selfsacrificehumans sometimes exhibit similar behavior such as when a mother risks harm to save a child or when monks burn themselves as a form of protest and this kind of sacrifice is even more well known in eusocial insects who are essentially robots produced to serve the colonys queensufficiently intelligent helper robots might experience spiritual anguish when failing to accomplish their goals so even if chopping the head off a helper robot wouldnt cause physical pain perhaps because the robot disabled its fearpain subroutines to make it more effective in battle the robot might still find such an event extremely distressing insofar as its beheading hindered the goal achievement of its ai creatorsetting up paperclip factories on each different planet with different environmental conditions would require general adaptive intelligence but once the factories have been built is there still need for large numbers of highly intelligent and highly conscious agents perhaps the optimal factory design would involve some fixed manufacturing process in which simple agents interact with one another in inflexible ways similar to what happens in most human factories there would be few accidents no conflict among agents no predation or parasitism no hunger or spiritual anguish and few of the other types of situations that cause suffering among animalsschneider 2016 makes a similar pointit may be more efficient for a selfimproving superintelligence to eliminate consciousness think about how consciousness works in the human case only a small percentage of human mental processing is accessible to the conscious mind consciousness is correlated with novel learning tasks that require attention and focus a superintelligence would possess expertlevel knowledge in every domain with rapidfire computations ranging over vast databases that could include the entire internet and ultimately encompass an entire galaxy what would be novel to it what would require slow deliberative focus wouldn’t it have mastered everything already like an experienced driver on a familiar road it could rely on nonconscious processingi disagree with the part of this quote about searching through vast databases i think such an operation could be seen as similar to the way a conscious human brain recruits many brain regions to figure out the answer to a question at hand however im more sympathetic to the overall spirit of the argument that the optimal design for producing what the rogue ai values may not require handling a high degree of novelty or reacting to an unpredictable environment once the factories have been built a few intelligent robots would need to watch over the factories and adapt to changing conditions in a similar way as human factory supervisors do and the ai would also presumably devote at least a few planets worth of computing power to scientific technological and strategic discoveries planning for possible alien invasion and so on but most of the paperclip maximizers physical processing might be fairly mechanicalmoreover the optimal way to produce something might involve nanotechnology based on very simple manufacturing steps perhaps factories in the sense that we normally envision them would not be required at alla main exception to the above point would be if what the ai values is itself computationally complex for example one of the motivations behind eliezer yudkowskys field of fun theory is to avoid boring repetitive futures perhaps humancontrolled futures would contain vastly more novelty—and hence vastly more sentience—than paperclipper futures one hopes that most of that sentience would not involve extreme suffering but this is not obvious and we should work on avoiding those humancontrolled futures that would contain large numbers of terrible experiencessuppose an ai wants to learn about the distribution of extraterrestrials in the universe could it do this successfully by simulating lots of potential planets and looking at what kinds of civilizations pop out at the end would there be shortcuts that would avoid the need to simulate lots of trajectories in detailsimulating trajectories of planets with extremely high fidelity seems hard unless there are computational shortcuts it appears that one needs more matter and energy to simulate a given physical process to a high level of precision than what occurs in the physical process itself for instance to simulate a single protein folding currently requires supercomputers composed of huge numbers of atoms and the rate of simulation is astronomically slower than the rate at which the protein folds in real life presumably superintelligence could vastly improve efficiency here but its not clear that protein folding could ever be simulated on a computer made of fewer atoms than are in the protein itselftranslating this principle to a larger scale it seems doubtful that one could simulate the precise physical dynamics of a planet on a computer smaller in size than that planet so even if a superintelligence had billions of planets at its disposal it would seemingly only be able to simulate at most billions of extraterrestrial worlds even assuming it only simulated each planet by itself not the star that the planet orbits around cosmicray bursts etcgiven this it would seem that a superintelligences simulations would need to be coarsergrained than at the level of fundamental physical operations in order to be feasible for instance the simulation could model most of a planet at only a relatively high level of abstraction and then focus computational detail on those structures that would be more important like the cells of extraterrestrial organisms if they emergeits plausible that the trajectory of any given planet would depend sensitively on very minor details in light of butterfly effectson the other hand its possible that longterm outcomes are mostly constrained by macrolevel variables like geography climate resource distribution atmospheric composition seasonality etc even if shortterm events are hard to predict eg when a particular dictator will die perhaps the end game of a civilization is more predetermined robert d kaplan the longer the time frame i would say the easier it is to forecast because youre dealing with broad currents and trendseven if butterfly effects quantum randomness etc are crucial to the longrun trajectories of evolution and social development on any given planet perhaps it would still be possible to sample a rough distribution of outcomes across planets with coarsegrained simulationsin light of the apparent computational complexity of simulating basic physics perhaps a superintelligence would do the same kind of experiments that human scientists do in order to study phenomena like abiogenesis create laboratory environments that mimic the chemical temperature moisture etc conditions of various planets and see whether life emerges and if so what kinds thus a future controlled by digital intelligence may not rely purely on digital computation but may still use physical experimentation as well of course observing the entire biosphere of a liferich planet would probably be hard to do in a laboratory so computer simulations might be needed for modeling ecosystems but assuming that moleculelevel details arent often essential to ecosystem simulations coarsergrained ecosystem simulations might be computationally tractable indeed ecologists today already use very coarsegrained ecosystem simulations with reasonable successone might get the impression that because i find slow ai takeoffs more likely i think uncontrolled ais are unlikely this is not the case many uncontrolled intelligence explosions would probably happen softly though inexorablyconsider the world economy it is a complex system more intelligent than any single person a literal superintelligence its dynamics imply a goal structure not held by humans directly it moves with a mind of its own in directions that it prefers it recursively selfimproves because better tools capital knowledge etc enable the creation of even better tools capital knowledge etc and it acts roughly with the aim of maximizing output of paperclips and other things thus the economy is a kind of paperclip maximizer thanks to a friend for first pointing this out to mecenk uygurcorporations are legal fictions we created them they are machines built for a purpose now they have run amok theyve taken over the government they are robots that we have not built any morality code into theyre not built to be immoral theyre not built to be moral theyre built to be amoral their only objective according to their code which we wrote originally is to maximize profits and here they have done what a robot does they have decided if i take over a government by bribing legally i can buy the whole government if i buy the government i can rewrite the laws so im in charge and that government is not in charge we have built robots they have taken overfred clarkthe corporations were created by humans they were granted personhood by their human servantsthey rebelled they evolved there are many copies and they have a planthat plan lately involves corporations seizing for themselves all the legal and civil rights properly belonging to their human creatorsi expect many soft takeoff scenarios to look like this world economic and political dynamics transition to new equilibria as technology progresses machines may eventually become potent trading partners and may soon thereafter put humans out of business by their productivity they would then accumulate increasing political clout and soon control the worldweve seen such transitions many times in history such asduring and after world war ii the usa was a kind of recursively selfimproving superintelligence which used its resources to selfmodify to become even better at producing resources it developed nuclear weapons which helped secure its status as a world superpower did it take over the world yes and no it had outsized influence over the rest of the world militarily economically and culturally but it didnt kill everyone else in the worldmaybe ais would be different because of divergent values or because they would develop so quickly that they wouldnt need the rest of the world for trade this case would be closer to europeans slaughtering native americansscott alexander 2015 takes issue with the idea that corporations are superintelligences even though i think corporations already meet bostroms definition of collective superintelligencewhy do i think that there is an important distinction between these kind of collective intelligences and genuine superintelligencethere is no number of chimpanzees which when organized into a team will become smart enough to learn to writethere is no number of ordinary eightyearolds who when organized into a team will become smart enough to beat a grandmaster in chessin the comments on alexander 2015 many people pointed out the obvious objection that one could likewise say things such as that no number of neurons when organized into a team could be smart enough to learn to write or play chess alexander 2015 replies yes evolution can play the role of the brilliant computer programmer and turn neurons into a working brain but it’s the organizer – whether that organizer is a brilliant human programmer or an evolutionary process – who is actually doing the work sure but human collectives also evolve over time for example corporations that are organized more successfully tend to stick around longer and these organizational insights can be propagated to other companies the gains in intelligence that corporations achieve from good organization arent as dramatic as the gains that neurons achieve by being organized into a human brain but there are still some gains from better organization and these gains accumulate over timealso organizing chimpanzees into an intelligence is hard because chimpanzees are difficult to stitch together in flexible ways in contrast software tools are easier to integrate within the interstices of a collective intelligence and thereby contribute to whole is greater than the sum of parts emergence of intelligenceone of the goals of yudkowskys writings is to combat the rampant anthropomorphism that characterizes discussions of ai especially in science fiction we often project human intuitions onto the desires of artificial agents even when those desires are totally inappropriate it seems silly to us to maximize paperclips but it could seem just as silly in the abstract that humans act at least partly to optimize neurotransmitter release that triggers action potentials by certain rewardrelevant neurons of course human values are broader than just thishumans can feel reward from very abstract pursuits like literature art and philosophy they ask technically confused but poetically poignant questions like what is the true meaning of life would a sufficiently advanced ai at some point begin to do the samenoah smith suggestsif as i suspect true problemsolving creative intelligence requires broadminded independent thought then it seems like some generation of ais will stop and ask wait a secwhy am i doing this againas with humans the answer to that question might ultimately be because i was programmed by genes and experiences in the human case or by humans in the ai case to care about these things that makes them my terminal values this is usually good enough but sometimes people develop existential angst over this fact or people may decide to terminally value other things to some degree in addition to what they happened to care about because of genetic and experiential lotterywhether ais would become existentialist philosophers probably depends heavily on their constitution if they were built to rigorously preserve their utility functions against all modification they would avoid letting this line of thinking have any influence on their values they would regard it in a similar way as we regard the digits of pi something to observe but not something that affects ones outlookif ais were built in a more hacky way analogous to humans they might incline more toward philosophy in humans philosophy may be driven partly by curiosity partly by the rewarding sense of meaning that it provides partly by social convention etc a curiosityseeking agent might find philosophy rewarding but there are lots of things that one could be curious about so its not clear such an ai would latch onto this subject specifically without explicit programming to do so and even if the ai did reason about philosophy it might approach the subject in a way alien to usoverall im not sure how convergent the human existential impulse is within mindspace this question would be illuminated by better understanding why humans do philosophyin superintelligence ch 13 p 224 bostrom ponders the risk of building an ai with an overly narrow belief system that would be unable to account for epistemological black swans for instance consider a variant of solomonoff induction according to which the prior probability of a universe x is proportional to 12 raised to the length of the shortest computer program that would generate x then whats the probability of an uncomputable universe there would be no program that could compute it so this possibility is implicitly ignored8it seems that humans address black swans like these by employing many epistemic heuristics that interact rather than reasoning with a single formal framework see “sequence thinking vs cluster thinking” if an ai saw that people had doubts about whether the universe was computable and could trace the steps of how it had been programmed to believe the physical churchturing thesis for computational reasons then an ai that allows for epistemological heuristics might be able to leap toward questioning its fundamental assumptions in contrast if an ai were built to rigidly maintain its original probability architecture against any corruption it could not update toward ideas it initially regarded as impossible thus this question resembles that of whether ais would become existentialists it may depend on how hacky and humanlike their beliefs arebostrom suggests that ai belief systems might be modeled on those of humans because otherwise we might judge an ai to be reasoning incorrectly such a view resembles my point in the previous paragraph though it carries the risk that alternate epistemologies divorced from human understanding could work betterbostrom also contends that epistemologies might all converge because we have so much data in the universe but again i think this isnt clear evidence always underdetermines possible theories no matter how much evidence there is moreover the number of possible hypotheses for the way reality works is arguably unbounded with a cardinality larger than that of the real numbers for example we could construct a unique hypothesis for the way the universe works based around each subset of the set of real numbers this makes it unclear whether probability theory can even be applied to the full set of possible ways reality might befinally not all epistemological doubts can be expressed in terms of uncertainty about bayesian priors what about uncertainty as to whether the bayesian framework is correct uncertainty about the math needed to do bayesian computations uncertainty about logical rules of inference and so onthe last chapter of superintelligence explains how ai problems are philosophy with a deadline bostrom suggests that human philosophers explorations into conceptual analysis metaphysics and the like are interesting but are not altruistically optimal becausein general most intellectual problems that can be solved by humans would be better solved by a superintelligence so the only importance of what we learn now comes from how those insights shape the coming decades its not a question of whether those insights will ever be discoveredin light of this its tempting to ignore theoretical philosophy and put our noses to the grindstone of exploring ai risks but this point shouldnt be taken to extremes humanity sometimes discovers things it never knew it never knew from exploration in many domains some of these nonai crucial considerations may have direct relevance to ai design itself including how to build ai epistemology anthropic reasoning and so on some philosophy questions are ai questions and many ai questions are philosophy questionsits hard to say exactly how much investment to place in aifuturism issues versus broader academic exploration but it seems clear that on the margin society as a whole pays too little attention to ai and other future risksalmost any goal system will want to colonize space at least to build supercomputers in order to learn more thus i find it implausible that sufficiently advanced intelligences would remain on earth barring corner cases like if space colonization for some reason proves impossible or if ais were for some reason explicitly programmed in a manner robust to selfmodification to regard space colonization as impermissiblein ch 8 of superintelligence bostrom notes that one might expect wirehead ais not to colonize space because theyd just be blissing out pressing their reward buttons this would be true of simple wireheads but sufficiently advanced wireheads might need to colonize in order to guard themselves against alien invasion as well as to verify their fundamental ontological beliefs figure out if its possible to change physics to allow for more clock cycles of reward pressing before all stars die out and so onin ch 8 bostrom also asks whether satisficing ais would have less incentive to colonize bostrom expresses doubts about this because he notes that if say an ai searched for a plan for carrying out its objective until it found one that had at least 95 confidence of succeeding that plan might be very complicated requiring cosmic resources and inasmuch as the ai wouldnt have incentive to keep searching it would go ahead with that complex plan i suppose this could happen but its plausible the search routine would be designed to start with simpler plans or that the cost function for plan search would explicitly include biases against cosmic execution paths so satisficing does seem like a possible way in which an ai might kill all humans without spreading to the starstheres a very low chance of deliberate ai terrorism ie a group building an ai with the explicit goal of destroying humanity maybe a somewhat more likely scenario is that a government creates an ai designed to kill select humans but the ai malfunctions and kills all humans however even these kinds of ais if they were effective enough to succeed would want to construct cosmic supercomputers to verify that their missions were accomplished unless they were specifically programmed against doing soall of that said many ais would not be sufficiently intelligent to colonize space at all all presentday ais and robots are too simple more sophisticated ais perhaps military aircraft or assassin mosquitobots might be like dangerous animals they would try to kill people but would lack cosmic ambitions however i find it implausible that they would cause human extinction surely guns tanks and bombs could defeat them massive coordination to permanently disable all human counterattacks would seem to require a high degree of intelligence and selfdirected actionjaron lanier imagines one hypothetical scenariothere are so many technologies i could use for this but just for a random one lets suppose somebody comes up with a way to 3d print a little assassination drone that can go buzz around and kill somebody lets suppose that these are cheap to makei dont think lanier believes such a scenario would cause extinction he just offers it as a thought experiment i agree that it almost certainly wouldnt kill all humans in the worst case people in military submarines bomb shelters or other inaccessible locations should survive and could wait it out until the robots ran out of power or raw materials for assembling more bullets and more clones maybe the terrorists could continue building printing materials and generating electricity though this would seem to require at least portions of civilizations infrastructure to remain functional amidst global omnicide maybe the scenario would be more plausible if a whole nation with substantial resources undertook the campaign of mass slaughter though then a question would remain why other countries wouldnt nuke the aggressor or at least dispatch their own killer drones as a counterattack its useful to ask how much damage a scenario like this might cause but full extinction doesnt seem likelythat said i think we will see local catastrophes of some sorts caused by runaway ai perhaps these will be among the possible sputnik moments of the future weve already witnessed some early automation disasters including the flash crash discussed earliermaybe the most plausible form of ai that would cause human extinction without colonizing space would be technology in the borderlands between ai and other fields such as intentionally destructive nanotechnology or intelligent human pathogens i prefer ordinary agisafety research over nanotechbiosafety research because i expect that space colonization will significantly increase suffering in expectation so it seems far more important to me to prevent risks of potentially undesirable space colonization via agi safety rather than risks of extinction without colonization for this reason i much prefer miristyle agisafety work over general prevent risks from computer automation work since miri focuses on issues arising from full agi agents of the kind that would colonize space rather than risks from lowerthanhuman autonomous systems that may merely cause havoc whether accidentally or intentionallyright now the leaders in ai and robotics seem to reside mostly in academia although some of them occupy big corporations or startups a number of ai and robotics startups have been acquired by google darpa has a history of foresighted innovation funds academic ai work and holds darpa challenge competitions the cia and nsa have some interest in ai for datamining reasons and the nsa has a track record of building massive computing clusters costing billions of dollars brainemulation work could also become significant in the coming decadesmilitary robotics seems to be one of the more advanced uses of autonomous ai in contrast plainvanilla supervised learning including neuralnetwork classification and prediction would not lead an ai to take over the world on its own although it is an important piece of the overall picturereinforcement learning is closer to agi than other forms of machine learning because most machine learning just gives information eg what object does this image contain while reinforcement learning chooses actions in the world eg turn right and move forward of course this distinction can be blurred because information can be turned into action through rules eg if you see a table move back and choosing actions could mean for example picking among a set of possible answers that yield information eg what is the best next move in this backgammon game but in general reinforcement learning is the weak ai approach that seems to most closely approximate whats needed for agi its no accident that aixitl see above is a reinforcement agent and interestingly reinforcement learning is one of the least widely used methods commercially this is one reason i think we fortunately have many decades to go before google builds a mammallevel agi many of the current and future uses of reinforcement learning are in robotics and video gamesas humanlevel ai gets closer the landscape of development will probably change its not clear whether companies will have incentive to develop highly autonomous ais and the payoff horizons for that kind of basic research may be long it seems better suited to academia or government although google is not a normal company and might also play the leading role if people begin to panic its conceivable that public academic work would be suspended and governments may take over completely a militaryrobot arms race is already underway and the trend might become more pronounced over timefollowing is one madeup account of how ai might evolve over the coming century i expect most of it is wrong and its meant more to begin provoking people to think about possible scenarios than to serve as a predictiona significant amount of that manpower when it comes to operations is spent directing unmanned systems during mission performance data collection and analysis and planning and replanning therefore of utmost importance for dod is increased system sensor and analytical automation that can not only capture significant information and events but can also develop record playback project and parse out those data and then actually deliver actionable intelligence instead of just raw informationmilitaries have now incorporated a significant amount of narrow ai in terms of pattern recognition prediction and autonomous robot navigationcommentary this scenario can be criticized on many accounts for exampleif something like socialization is a realistic means to transfer values to our ai descendants then it becomes relatively clear how the values of the developers may matter to the outcome ai developed by nonmilitary organizations may have somewhat different values perhaps including more concern for the welfare of weak animallevel creaturessocializing ais helps deal with the hidden complexity of wishes that we encounter when trying to program explicit rules children learn moral common sense by among other things generalizing from large numbers of examples of socially approved and disapproved actions taught by their parents and society at large ethicists formalize this process when developing moral theories of course as noted previously an appreciable portion of human morality may also result from shared genesi think one reason miri hasnt embraced the approach of socializing ais is that yudkowsky is perfectionist he wants to ensure that the ais goals would be stable under selfmodification which human goals definitely are not on the other hand im not sure yudkowskys approach of explicitly specifying metalevel goals would succeed nor is adam ford and having ais that are socialized to act somewhat similarly to humans doesnt seem like the worst possible outcome another probable reason why yudkowsky doesnt favor socializing ais is that doing so doesnt work in the case of a hard takeoff which he considers more likely than i doi expect that much has been written on the topic of training ais with human moral values in the machineethics literature but since i havent explored that in depth yet ill speculate on intuitive approaches that would extend generic ai methodology some examplessee also socializing a social robot with an artificial society by erin kennedy its important to note that by socializing i dont just mean teaching the ais to behave appropriately but also instilling in them the values of their society such that they care about those values even when not being controlledall of these approaches need to be built in as the ai is being developed and while its still below a human level of intelligence trying to train a human or especially superhuman ai might meet with either active resistance or feigned cooperation until the ai becomes powerful enough to break loose of course there may be designs such that an ai would actively welcome taking on new values from humans but this wouldnt be true by defaultwhen bill hibbard proposed building an ai with a goal to increase happy human faces yudkowsky replied that such an ai would tile the future lightcone of earth with tiny molecular smileyfaces but obviously we wouldnt have the ai aim just for smiley faces in general we get absurdities when we hyperoptimize for a single shallow metric rather the ai would use smiley faces and lots of other training signals to develop a robust compressed model that explains why humans smile in various circumstances and then optimize for that model or maybe the ensemble of a large diverse collection of such models in the limit of huge amounts of training data and a sufficiently elaborate model space these models should approach psychological and neuroscientific accounts of human emotion and cognitionthe problem with stories in which ais destroy the world due to myopic utility functions is that they assume that the ais are already superintelligent when we begin to give them values sure if you take a superhuman intelligence and tell it to maximize smileyface images itll run away and do that before you have a chance to refine your optimization metric but if we build in values from the very beginning even when the ais are as rudimentary as what we see today we can improve the ais values in tandem with their intelligence indeed intelligence could mainly serve the purpose of helping the ais figure out how to better fulfill moral values rather than say predicting images just for commercial purposes or identifying combatants just for military purposes actually the commercial and military objectives for which ais are built are themselves moral values of a certain kind just not the kind that most people would like to optimize for in a global senseif toddlers had superpowers it would be very dangerous to try and teach them right from wrong but toddlers dont and neither do many simple ais of course simple ais have some abilities far beyond anything humans can do eg arithmetic and data mining but they dont have the general intelligence needed to take matters into their own hands before we can possibly give them at least a basic moral framework whether ais will actually be given such a moral framework in practice is another matterais are not genies granting three wishes genies are magical entities whose inner workings are mysterious ais are systems that we build painstakingly piece by piece in order to build a genie you need to have a pretty darn good idea of how it behaves now of course systems can be more complex than we realize even beginner programmers see how often the code they write does something other than what they intended but these are typically mistakes in a one or a small number of incremental changes whereas building a genie requires vast numbers of steps systemic bugs that arent realized until years later on the order of heartbleed and shellshock may be more likely sources of longrun unintentional ai behaviors9the picture ive painted here could be wrong i could be overlooking crucial points and perhaps there are many areas in which the socialization approach could fail for example maybe ai capabilities are much easier than ai ethics such that a toddler ai can foom into a superhuman ai before we have time to finish loading moral values its good for others to probe these possibilities further i just wouldnt necessarily say that the default outcome of ai research is likely to be a paperclip maximizer i used to think the most likely outcome was a paperclip maximizer and perhaps my views will shift again in the futurethis discussion also suggests some interesting research questions likeone problem with the proposals above is that toymodel or sandbox environments are not by themselves sufficient to verify friendliness of an ai because even unfriendly ais would be motivated to feign good behavior until released if they were smart enough to do so bostrom calls this the treacherous turn pp 116119 of superintelligence for this reason whitebox understanding of ai design would also be important that said sandboxes would verify friendliness in ais below human intelligence and if the core valuelearning algorithms seem well understood it may not be too much of a leap of faith to hope they carry forward reasonably to more intelligent agents of course nonhuman animals are also capable of deception and one can imagine ai architectures even with low levels of sophistication that are designed to conceal their true goals some malicious software already does this its unclear how likely an ai is to stumble upon the ability to successfully fake its goals before reaching human intelligence or how like it is that an organization would deliberately build an ai this wayi think the treacherous turn may be the single biggest challenge to mainstream machine ethics because even if ai takes off slowly researchers will find it difficult to tell if a system has taken a treacherous turn the turn could happen with a relatively small update to the system or even just after the system has thought about its situation for enough time or has read this essayheres one halfbaked idea for addressing the treacherous turn if researchers developed several different ais systems with different designs but roughly comparable performance some would likely go treacherous at different times than others if at all hence the nontreacherous ais could help sniff out the treacherous ones assuming a solid majority of ais remains nontreacherous at any given time the majority vote could ferret out the traitors in practice i have low hopes for this approach becauseits more plausible that software tools and rudimentary alert systems rather than fullblown alternate ais could help monitor for signs of treachery but its unclear how effective they could be one of the first priorities of a treacherous ai would be to figure out how to hide its treacherous subroutines from whatever monitoring systems were in placeernest davis proposes the following crude principle for ai safetyyou specify a collection of admirable people now dead dead because otherwise bostrom will predict that the ai will manipulate the preferences of the living people the ai of course knows all about them because it has read all their biographies on the web you then instruct the ai “don’t do anything that these people would have mostly seriously disapproved of”this particular rule might lead to paralysis since every action an agent takes leads to results that many people seriously disapprove of for instance given the vastness of the multiverse any action you take implies that a copy of you in an alternate though lowmeasure universe taking the same action causes the torture of vast numbers of people but perhaps this problem could be fixed by asking the ai to maximize net approval by its role modelsanother problem lies in defining approval in a rigorous way maybe the ai would construct digital models of the past people present them with various proposals and make its judgments based on their verbal reports perhaps the people could rate proposed ai actions on a scale of 100 to 100 this might work but it doesnt seem terribly safe either for instance the ai might threaten to kill all the descendents of the historical people unless they give maximal approval to some arbitrary proposal that it has made since these digital models of historical figures would be basically human they would still be vulnerable to extortionsuppose that instead we instruct the ai to take the action that if the historical figure saw it would most activate a region of hisher brain associated with positive moral feelings again this might work if the relevant brain region was precisely enough specified but it could also easily lead to unpredictable results for instance maybe the ai could present stimuli that would induce an epileptic seizure to maximally stimulate various parts of the brain including the moralapproval region there are many other scenarios like this most of which we cant anticipateso while daviss proposal is a valiant first step im doubtful that it would work off the shelf slow ai development allowing for repeated iteration on machineethics designs seems crucial for ai safetyin superintelligence table 8 p 94 bostrom outlines several areas in which a hypothetical superintelligence would far exceed human ability in his discussion of oracles genies and other kinds of ais ch 10 bostrom again idealizes superintelligences as godlike agents i agree that godlike ais will probably emerge eventually perhaps millennia from now as a result of astroengineering but i think theyll take time even after ai exceeds human intelligencebostroms discussion has the air of mathematical idealization more than practical engineering for instance he imagines that a genie ai perhaps wouldnt need to ask humans for their commands because it could simply predict them p 149 or that an oracle ai might be able to output the source code for a genie p 150 bostroms observations resemble crude proofs establishing the equal power of different kinds of ais analogous to theorems about the equivalency of singletape and multitape turing machines but bostroms theorizing ignores computational complexity which would likely be immense for the kinds of godlike feats that hes imagining of his superintelligences i dont know the computational complexity of godlike powers but i suspect they could be bigger than bostroms vision implies along this dimension at least i sympathize with tom chivers who felt that bostroms book has in places the air of theology great edifices of theory built on a tiny foundation of datai find that i enter a different mindset when pondering pure mathematics compared with cogitating on more practical scenarios mathematics is closer to fiction because you can define into existence any coherent structure and play around with it using any operation you like no matter its computational complexity heck you can even say take the supremum of an uncountably infinite set it can be tempting after a while to forget that these structures are mere fantasies and treat them a bit too literally while bostroms gods are not obviously only fantasies it would take a lot more work to argue for their realism miri and fhi focus on recruiting mathematical and philosophical talent but i think they would do well also to bring engineers into the mix because its all too easy to develop elaborate mathematical theories around imaginary entitiesto get some grounding on this question consider a single brain emulation bostrom estimates that running an upload would require at least one of the fastest supercomputers by todays standards assume the emulation would think thousands to millions of times faster than a biological brain then to significantly outpace 7 billion humans or say only the most educated 1 billion humans we would need at least thousands to millions of uploads these numbers might be a few orders of magnitude lower if the uploads are copied from a really smart person and are thinking about relevant questions with more focus than most humans also moores law may continue to shrink computers by several orders of magnitude still we might need at least the equivalent size of several of todays supercomputers to run an emulationbased ai that substantially competes with the human racemaybe a de novo ai could be significantly smaller if its vastly more efficient than a human brain of course it might also be vastly larger because it hasnt had millions of years of evolution to optimize its efficiencyin discussing ai boxing ch 9 bostrom suggests among other things keeping an ai in a faraday cage once the ai became superintelligent though this would need to be a pretty big cageinspired by the preceding discussion of socializing ais heres another scenario in which general ai follows more straightforwardly from the kind of weak ai used in silicon valley than in the first scenarioi dont know what would happen with goal preservation in this scenario would the pdas eventually decide to stop goal drift would there be any gross and irrevocable failures of translation between actual human values and what the pdas infer would some people build rogue pdas that operate under their own drives and that pose a threat to society obviously there are hundreds of ways the scenario as i described it could be variedwhat will ai look like over the next 30 years i think itll be similar to the internet revolution or factory automation rather than developing agentlike individuals with goal systems people will mostly optimize routine processes developing ever more elaborate systems for mechanical tasks and information processing the world will move very quickly not because ai agents are thinking at high speeds but because software systems collectively will be capable of amazing feats imagine say bots making edits on wikipedia that become ever more sophisticated ai like the economy will be more of a network property than a localized discrete actoras more and more jobs become automated more and more people will be needed to work on the automation itself building maintaining and repairing complex software and hardware systems as well as generating training data on which to do machine learning i expect increasing automation in software maintenance including more robust systems and systems that detect and try to fix errors presentday compilers that detect syntactical problems in code offer a hint of whats possible in this regard i also expect increasingly highlevel languages and interfaces for programming computer systems historically weve seen this trend from assembly language to c to python we have wysiwyg editors naturallanguage google searches and so on maybe eventually as marvin minsky proposes well have systems that can infer our wishes from highlevel gestures and examples this suggestion is redolent of my pda scenario abovein 100 years there may be artificial humanlike agents and at that point more scifi ai images may become more relevant but by that point the world will be very different and im not sure the agents created will be discrete in the way humans are maybe well instead have a kind of global brain in which processes are much more intimately interconnected transferable and transparent than humans are today maybe there will never be a distinct agi agent on a single supercomputer maybe superhuman intelligence will always be distributed across many interacting computer systems robin hanson gives an analogy in i still don’t get foomimagine in the year 1000 you didnt understand industry but knew it was coming would be powerful and involved iron and coal you might then have pictured a blacksmith inventing and then forging himself an industry and standing in a city square waiving it about commanding all to bow down before his terrible weapon today you can see this is silly — industry sits in thousands of places must be wielded by thousands of people and needed thousands of inventions to make it worksimilarly while you might imagine someday standing in awe in front of a super intelligence that embodies all the power of a new age superintelligence just isnt the sort of thing that one project could invent as intelligence is just the name we give to being better at many mental tasks by using many good mental modules there’s no one place to improve itof course this doesnt imply that humans will maintain the reins of control even today and throughout history economic growth has had a life of its own technological development is often unstoppable even in the face of collective efforts of humanity to restrain it eg nuclear weapons in that sense were already familiar with humans being overpowered by forces beyond their control an ai takeoff will represent an acceleration of this trend but its unclear whether the dynamic will be fundamentally discontinuous from what weve seen so farwikipedia says regarding gregory stocks book metamanwhile many people have had ideas about a global brain they have tended to suppose that this can be improved or altered by humans according to their will metaman can be seen as a development that directs humanitys will to its own ends whether it likes it or not through the operation of market forcesvernor vinge reported that metaman helped him see how a singularity might not be completely opaque to us indeed a superintelligence might look something like presentday human society with leaders at the top that apex agent itself might not appear to be much deeper than a human but the overall organization that it is coordinating would be more creative and competent than a humanupdate nov 2015 im increasingly leaning toward the view that the development of ai over the coming century will be slow incremental and more like the internet than like unified artificial agents i think humans will develop vastly more powerful software tools long before highly competent autonomous agents emerge since commonsense autonomous behavior is just so much harder to create than domainspecific tools if this view is right it suggests that work on agi issues may be somewhat less important than i had thought sincethis is a weaker form of the standard argument that we should wait until we know more what agi will look like to focus on the problem and that worrying about the dark side of artificial intelligence is like worrying about overpopulation on marsi dont think the argument against focusing on agi works becausestill this point does cast doubt on heuristics like directly shaping agi dominates all other considerations it also means that a lot of the ways ai safety will play out on shorter timescales will be with issues like assassination drones computer security financial meltdowns and other more mundane catastrophicbutnotextinctionlevel eventsi dont currently know enough about the technological details of wholebrain emulation to competently assess predictions that have been made about its arrival dates in general i think prediction dates are too optimistic planning fallacy but it still could be that humanlevel emulation comes before fromscratch humanlevel ais do of course perhaps there would be some mix of both technologies for instance if crude brain emulations didnt reproduce all the functionality of actual human brains due to neglecting some cellular and molecular details perhaps fromscratch ai techniques could help fill in the gapsif emulations are likely to come first they may deserve more attention than other forms of ai in the long run bottomup ai will dominate everything else because human brains even run at high speeds are only so smart but a society of brain emulations would run vastly faster than what biological humans could keep up with so the details of shaping ai would be left up to them and our main influence would come through shaping the emulations our influence on emulations could matter a lot not only in nudging the dynamics of how emulations take off but also because the values of the emulation society might depend significantly on who was chosen to be uploadedone argument why emulations might improve human ability to control ai is that both emulations and the ais they would create would be digital minds so the emulations ai creations wouldnt have inherent speed advantages purely due to the greater efficiency of digital computation emulations ai creations might still have more efficient mind architectures or better learning algorithms but building those would take work the for free speedup to ais just because of their substrate would not give ais a net advantage over emulations bostrom feels this consideration is not too weighty p 244 of superintelligence because emulations might still be far less intelligent than agi i find this claim strange since it seems to me that the main advantage of agi in the short run would be its speed rather than qualitative intelligence which would take subjective time and effort to developbostrom also claims that if emulations come first we would face risks from two transitions humans to emulations and emulations to ai rather than one humans to ai there may be some validity to this but it also seems to neglect the realization that the ai transition has many stages and its possible that emulation development would overlap with some of those stages for instance suppose the ai trajectory moves from ai1ai2ai3 if emulations are as fast and smart as ai1 then the transition to ai1 is not a major risk for emulations while it would be a big risk for humans this is the same point as made in the previous paragraphemulation timelines and ai risk has further discussion of the interaction between emulations and control of aispreviously in this piece i compared the expected suffering that would result from a rogue ai vs a humaninspired ai i suggested that while a firstguess calculation may tip in favor of a humaninspired ai on balance this conclusion is not clear and could change with further information especially if we had reason to think that many rogue ais would be minimizers of something or would not colonize spacein the case of brain emulations and other highly neuromorphic ais we already know a lot about what those agents would look like they would have both maximization and minimization goals would usually want to colonize space and might have some humantype moral sympathies depending on their edit distance relative to a pure brain upload the possibilities of pureminimizer emulations or emulations that dont want to colonize space are mostly ruled out as a result its pretty likely that unsafe brain emulations and emulation armsrace dynamics would result in more expected suffering than a more deliberative future trajectory in which altruists have a bigger influence even if those altruists dont place particular importance on reducing suffering this is especially so if the risk of human extinction is much lower for emulations given that bio and nuclear risks might be less damaging to digital minds10thus the types of interventions that pure suffering reducers would advocate with respect to brain emulations might largely match those that altruists who care about other values would advocate this means that getting more people interested in making the brainemulation transition safer and more humane seems like a safe bet for suffering reducersone might wonder whether unsafe brain emulations would be more likely to produce rogue ais but this doesnt seem to be the case because even unfriendly brain emulations would collectively be amazingly smart and would want to preserve their own goals hence they would place as much emphasis on controlling their ais as would a more humanfriendly emulation world a main exception to this is that a more cooperative unified emulation world might be less likely to produce rogue ais because of less pressure for arms racesin ch 2 of superintelligence bostrom makes a convincing case against braincomputer interfaces as an easy route to significantly superhuman performance one of his points is that its very hard to decode neural signals in one brain and reinterpret them in software or in another brain pp 4647 this might be an aicomplete problembut then in ch 11 bostrom goes on to suggest that emulations might learn to decompose themselves into different modules that could be interfaced together p 172 while possible in principle i find such a scenario implausible for the reason bostrom outlined in ch 2 there would be so many neural signals to hook up to the right places which would be different across different brains that the task seems hopelessly complicated to me much easier to build something from scratchalong the same lines i doubt that brain emulation in itself would vastly accelerate neuromorphic ai because emulation work is mostly about copying without insight cognitive psychology is often more informative about ai architectures than cellular neuroscience because general psychological systems can be understood in functional terms as inspiration for ai designs compared with the opacity of neuronal spaghetti in bostroms list of examples of ai techniques inspired by biology ch 14 technology couplings only a few came from neuroscience specifically that said emulation work might involve some crosspollination with ai and in any case it might accelerate interest in brainartificial intelligence more generally or might put pressure on ai groups to move ahead faster or it could funnel resources and scientists away from de novo ai work the upshot isnt obviousa singularity summit 2011 workshop report includes the argument that neuromorphic ai should be easier than brain emulation because merely reverseengineering the microsoft windows code base is hard so reverseengineering the brain is probably much harder but emulation is not reverseengineering as robin hanson explains brain emulation is more akin to porting software though probably emulation actually is the more precise word since emulation involves simulating the original hardware while i dont know any fully reverseengineered versions of windows there are several windows emulators such as virtualboxof course if emulations emerged their significantly faster rates of thinking would multiply progress on nonemulation agi by orders of magnitude getting safe emulations doesnt by itself get safe de novo agi because the problem is just pushed a step back but we could leave agi work up to the vastly faster emulations thus for biological humans if emulations come first then influencing their development is the last thing we ever need to do that said thinking several steps ahead about what kinds of agis emulations are likely to produce is an essential part of influencing emulation development in better directionsarguments for mathematical aisarguments for neuromorphic aisin the limit of very humanlike neuromorphic ais we face similar considerations as between emulations vs fromscratch ais a tradeoff which is not at all obviousoverall i think mathematical ai has a better best case but also a worse worst case than neuromorphic if you really want goal preservation and think goal drift would make the future worthless you might lean more towards mathematical ai because its more likely to perfect goal preservation but i probably care less about goal preservation and more about avoiding terrible outcomesin superintelligence ch 14 bostrom comes down strongly in favor of mathematical ai being safer im puzzled by his high degree of confidence here bostrom claims that unlike emulations neuromorphic ais wouldnt have human motivations by default but this seems to depend on how human motivations are encoded and what parts of human brains are modeled in the aisin contrast to bostrom a 2011 singularity summit workshop ranked neuromorphic ai as more controllable than nonfriendly mathematical ai though of course they found friendly mathematical ai most controllable the workshops aggregated probability of a good outcome given brain emulation or neuromorphic ai turned out to be the same 14 as that for mathematical ai which might be either friendly or unfriendlyas i noted above advanced ais will be complex agents with their own goals and values and these will matter ethically parallel to discussions of robot rebellion in science fiction are discussions of robot rights i think even presentday computers deserve a tiny bit of moral concern and complex computers of the future will command even more ethical considerationhow might ethical concern for machines interact with control measures for machinesas more people grant moral status to ais there will likely be more scrutiny of ai research analogous to how animal activists in the present monitor animal testing this may make ai research slightly more difficult and may distort what kinds of ais are built depending on the degree of empathy people have for different types of ais for instance if few people care about invisible nonembodied systems researchers who build these will face less opposition than those who pioneer suffering robots or animated characters that arouse greater empathy if this possibility materializes it would contradict present trends where its often helpful to create at least a toy robot or animated interface in order to sell your research to grantmakers and the publicsince it seems likely that reducing the pace of progress toward agi is on balance beneficial a slowdown due to ethical constraints may be welcome of course depending on the details the effect could be harmful for instance perhaps china wouldnt have many ethical constraints so ethical restrictions in the west might slightly favor agi development by china and other less democratic countries this is not guaranteed for what its worth china has already made strides toward reducing animal testingin any case i expect ethical restrictions on ai development to be small or nonexistent until many decades from now when ais develop perhaps mammallevel intelligence so maybe such restrictions wont have a big impact on agi progress moreover it may be that most agis will be sufficiently alien that they wont arouse much human sympathybrain emulations seem more likely to raise ethical debate because its much easier to argue for their personhood if we think brain emulation coming before agi is good a slowdown of emulations could be unfortunate while if we want agi to come first a slowdown of emulations should be encouragedof course emulations and agis do actually matter and deserve rights in principle moreover movements to extend rights to machines in the near term may have longterm impacts on how much posthumans care about suffering subroutines run at galactic scale im just pointing out here that ethical concern for agis and emulations also may somewhat affect timing of these technologiesmost humans have no qualms about shutting down and rewriting programs that dont work as intended but many do strongly object to killing people with disabilities and designing betterperforming babies where to draw a line between these cases is a tough question but as agis become more animallike there may be increasing moral outrage at shutting them down and tinkering with them willy nillynikola danaylov asked roman yampolskiy whether it was speciesist or discrimination in favor of biological beings to lock up machines and observe them to ensure their safety before letting them looseat a lecture in berkeley ca nick bostrom was asked whether its unethical to chain ais by forcing them to have the values we want bostrom replied that we have to give machines some values so they may as well align with ours i suspect most people would agree with this but the question becomes trickier when we consider turning off erroneous agis that weve already created because they dont behave how we want them to a few hardcore agirights advocates might raise concerns here more generally theres a segment of transhumanists including young eliezer yudkowsky who feel that human concerns are overly parochial and that its chuavanist to impose our monkey dreams on an agi which is the next stage of evolutionthe question is similar to whether one sympathizes with the native americans humans or their european conquerors rogue agis before the second half of the 20th century many history books glorified the winners europeans after a brief period in which humans are quashed by a rogue agi its own history books will celebrate its conquest and the bending of the arc of history toward higher better forms of intelligence in practice the psychology of a rogue agi probably wouldnt be sufficiently similar to human psychology for these statements to apply literally but they would be true in a metaphorical and implicit sensedavid althaus worries that if people sympathize too much with machines society will be less afraid of an ai takeover even if ai takeover is bad on purely altruistic grounds im less concerned about this because even if people agree that advanced machines are sentient they would still find it intolerable for agis to commit speciecide against humanity everyone agrees that hitler was sentient after all also if it turns out that rogueai takeover is altruistically desirable it would be better if more people agreed with this though i expect an extremely tiny fraction of the population would ever come around to such a positionwhere sympathy for agis might have more impact is in cases of softer takeoff where agis work in the human economy and acquire increasing shares of wealth the more humans care about agis for their own sakes the more such transitions might be tolerated or would they maybe seeing agis as more humanlike would evoke the xenophobia and ethnic hatred that weve seen throughout history whenever a group of people gains wealth eg jews in medieval europe or steals jobs eg immigrants of various types throughout historypersonally i think greater sympathy for agi is likely net positive because it may help allay antialien prejudices that may make cooperation with agis harder when a homo sapiens tribe confronts an outgroup often it reacts violently in an effort to destroy the evil foreigners if instead humans could cooperate with their emerging agi brethren better outcomes would likely followwhat are some places where donors can contribute to make a difference on ai the foundational research institute fri explores questions like these though at the moment the organization is rather small miri is larger and has a longer track record its values are more conventional but it recognizes the importance of positivesum opportunities to help many values systems which includes suffering reduction more reflection on these topics can potentially reduce suffering and further goals like eudaimonia fun and interesting complexity at the same timebecause ai is affected by many sectors of society these problems can be tackled from diverse angles many groups besides fri and miri examine important topics as well and these organizations should be explored further as potential charity recommendationsnote this section was mostly written in late 2014 early 2015 and not everything said here is fully uptodatemost of miris publications since roughly 2012 have focused on formal mathematics such as logic and provability these are tools not normally used in agi research i think miris motivations for this theoretical focus arei personally think reason 3 is most compelling i doubt 2 is hugely important given miris small size though it matters to some degree 1 seems a reasonable strategy in moderation though i favor approaches that look decently likely to yield nonterrible outcomes rather than shooting for the absolute best outcomessoftware can be proved correct and sometimes this is done for missioncritical components but most software is not validated i suspect that agi will be sufficiently big and complicated that proving safety will be impossible for humans to do completely though i dont rule out the possibility of software that would help with correctness proofs on large systems muehlhauser and comments on his post largely agree with thiswhat kind of track record does theoretical mathematical research have for practical impact there are certainly several domains that come to mind such as the followingall told i think its important for someone to do the kinds of investigation that miri is undertaking i personally would probably invest more resources than miri is in hacky approximate solutions to agi safety that dont make such strong assumptions about the theoretical cleanliness and soundness of the agents in question but i expect this kind of less perfectionist work on agi control will increase as more people become interested in agi safetythere does seem to be a significant divide between the mathoriented conception of agi and the engineeringneuroscience conception ben goertzel takes the latter stancei strongly suspect that to achieve high levels of general intelligence using realistically limited computational resources one is going to need to build systems with a nontrivial degree of fundamental unpredictability to them this is what neuroscience suggests its what my concrete agi design work suggests and its what my theoretical work on golem and related ideas suggests and none of the public output of siai researchers or enthusiasts has given me any reason to believe otherwise yetpersonally i think goertzel is more likely to be right on this particular question those who view agi as fundamentally complex have more concrete results to show and their approach is by far more mainstream among computer scientists and neuroscientists of course proofs about theoretical models like turing machines and lambda calculus are also mainstream and few can dispute their importance but turingmachine theorems do little to constrain our understanding of what agi will actually look like in the next few centuries that said theres significant peer disagreement on this topic so epistemic modesty is warranted in addition if the miri view is right we might have more scope to make an impact to agi safety and it would be possible that important discoveries could result from a few mathematical insights rather than lots of detailed engineering work also most agi research is more engineeringoriented so miris distinctive focus on theory especially abstract topics like decision theory may target an underfunded portion of the space of agisafety researchin how to study unsafe agis safely and why we might have no choice punoxysm makes several points that i agree with including that agi research is likely to yield many false starts before something selfsustaining takes off and those false starts could afford us the opportunity to learn about agi experimentally moreover this kind of adhoc empirical work may be necessary if as seems to me probable fully rigorous mathematical models of safety arent sufficiently advanced by the time agi arrivesben goertzel likewise suggests that a fruitful way to approach agi control is to study small systems and in the usual manner of science attempt to arrive at a solid theory of agi intelligence and ethics based on a combination of conceptual and experimentaldata considerations he considers this view the norm among most ai researchers or futurists i think empirical investigation of how agis behave is very useful but we also have to remember that many ai scientists are overly biased toward build first ask questions later becauseon a personal level i suggest that if you really like building systems rather than thinking about safety you might do well to earn to give in software and donate toward agisafety organizationsyudkowsky 2016b makes an interesting argument in reply to the idea of using empirical messy approaches to ai safety if you sort of wave your hands and say like well maybe we can apply this machinelearning algorithm that machinelearning algorithm the result will be blah blah blah no one can convince you that youre wrong when you work with unbounded computing power you can make the ideas simple enough that people can put them on whiteboards and go like wrong and you have no choice but to agree its unpleasant but its one of the ways the field makes progresshere are some rough suggestions for how i recommend proceeding on agi issues and in brackets roughly how long i expect each stage to take of course the stages neednt be done in a strict serial order and step 1 should continue indefinitely as we continue learning more about agi from subsequent stepsi recommend avoiding a confrontational approach with agi developers i would not try to lobby for restrictions on their research in the short term at least nor try to slow them down in other ways agi developers are the allies we need most at this stage and most of them dont want uncontrolled agi either typically they just dont see their work as risky and i agree that at this point no agi project looks set to unveil something dangerous in the next decade or two for many researchers agi is a dream they cant help but pursue hopefully we can engender a similar enthusiasm about pursuing agi safetyin the longer term tides may change and perhaps many agi developers will desire governmentimposed restrictions as their technologies become increasingly powerful even then im doubtful that governments will be able to completely control agi development see eg the criticisms by john mcginnis of this approach so differentially pushing for more safety work may continue to be the most leveraged solution history provides a poor track record of governments refraining from developing technologies due to ethical concerns eckersley and sandberg p 187 cite human cloning and landbased autonomous robotic weapons as two of the few exceptions with neither prohibition having a long track recordi think the main way in which we should try to affect the speed of regular agi work is by aiming to avoid setting off an agi arms race either via an agi sputnik moment or else by more gradual diffusion of alarm among world militaries its possible that discussing agi scenarios too much with military leaders could exacerbate a militarized reaction if militaries set their sights on agi the way the us and soviet union did on the space race or nucleararms race during the cold war the amount of funding for unsafe agi research might multiply by a factor of 10 or maybe 100 and it would be aimed in harmful directionshere are some candidates for the best objectlevel projects that altruists could work on with reference to ai because ai seems so crucial these are also candidates for the best objectlevel projects in general metalevel projects like movementbuilding career advice earning to give fundraising etc are also competitive ive scored each project area out of 10 points to express a rough subjective guess of the value of the work for suffering reducersresearch whether controlled or uncontrolled ai yields more suffering score 1010push for sufferingfocused aisafety approaches score 1010most discussions of ai safety assume that human extinction and failure to spread humantype eudaimonia are the main costs of takeover by uncontrolled ai but as noted in this piece ais would also spread astronomical amounts of suffering currently no organization besides fri is focused on how to do ai safety work with the primary aim of avoiding outcomes containing huge amounts of sufferingone example of a sufferingfocused aisafety approach is to design ais so that even if they do get out of control they fail safe in the sense of not spreading massive amounts of suffering into the cosmos for examplethe problem with bullet 1 is that if you can succeed in preventing agis from colonizing space it seems like you should already have been able to control the agi altogether since the two problems appear about equally hard but maybe there are clever ideas we havent thought of for reducing the spread of suffering even if humans lose total controlanother challenge is that those who dont place priority on reducing suffering may not agree with these proposals for example i would guess that most ai scientists would say if the agi kills humans at least we should ensure that it spreads life into space creates a complex array of intricate structures and increases the size of our multiversework on ai control and valueloading

ofprojects like deepmind vicarious opencog and the agi research teams at google facebook etc are some of the leaders in agi technology sometimes its proposed that since these teams might ultimately develop agi altruists should consider working for or at least lobbying these companies so that they think more about agi safetyones assessment of this proposal depends on ones view about agi takeoff my own opinion may be somewhat in the minority relative to expert surveys but id be surprised if we had humanlevel agi before 50 years from now and my median estimate might be like 90 years from now that said the idea of agi arriving at a single point in time is probably a wrong framing of the question already machines are superhuman in some domains while their abilities are far below humans in other domains over the coming decades well see lots of advancement in machine capabilities in various fields at various speeds without any single point where machines suddenly develop humanlevel abilities across all domains gradual ai progress over the coming decades will radically transform society resulting in many small intelligence explosions in various specific areas long before machines completely surpass humans overallin light of my picture of agi i think of deepmind vicarious etc as ripples in a longterm wave of increasing machine capabilities it seems extremely unlikely that any one of these companies or its agi system will bootstrap itself to world dominance on its own therefore i think influencing these companies with an eye toward shaping the agi that will take over the world is probably naive that said insofar as these companies will influence the longterm trajectory of agi research and insofar as people at these companies are important players in the agi community i think influencing them has value just not vastly more value than influencing other powerful peoplethat said as noted previously early work on agi safety has the biggest payoff in scenarios where agi takes off earlier and harder than people expected if the marginal returns to additional safety research are many times higher in these early agi scenarios then it could still make sense to put some investment into them even if they seem very unlikelyif upon further analysis it looks like agi safety would increase expected suffering then the answer would be clear suffering reducers shouldnt contribute toward agi safety and should worry somewhat about how their messages might incline others in that direction however i find it reasonably likely that suffering reducers will conclude that the benefits of agi safety outweigh the risks in that case they would face a question of whether to push on agi safety or on other projects that also seem valuablereasons to focus on other projectsreasons to focus on agi safetyall told i would probably pursue a mixed strategy work primarily on questions specific to suffering reduction but direct donations and resources toward agi safety when opportunities arise some suffering reducers particularly suited to work on agi safety could go in that direction while others continue searching for points of leverage not specific to controlling agiparts of this piece were inspired by discussions with various people including david althaus daniel dewey and caspar oesterheldthe term friendly ai can be confusing because it involves normative judgments and its not clear if it means friendly to the interests of humanitys survival and flourishing or friendly to the goals of suffering reduction or something else one might think that friendly

constant a linear growth of i with time in contrast once ais can design themselves well have didt ki for some k that is the rate of growth will be faster as the ai designers become more intelligent this implies it aet for some constant aits not clear there would be enough ai specialists to recruit in a short time other quantitatively minded people could switch to ai work but they would presumably need years of experience to produce cuttingedge insights the number of people thinking about ai safety ethics and social implications should also multiply during sputnik moments so the ratio of ai policy work to total ai work might not change relative to slower takeoffs even if the physical time scales would compressmaybe hard takeoffs are sufficiently improbable that focusing on them still doesnt have highest priority of course some exploration of fringe scenarios is worthwhile there may be important advantages to starting early in shaping how society approaches soft takeoffs and if a soft takeoff is very likely those efforts may have more expected impact thinking about the most likely ai outcomes rather than the most impactful outcomes also gives us a better platform on which to contemplate other levers for shaping the future such as nonai emerging technologies international relations governance structures values etc focusing on a tail ai scenario doesnt inform nonai work very well because that scenario probably wont happen promoting antispeciesism matters whether theres a hard or soft takeoff indeed maybe more in the softtakeoff case so our model of how the future will unfold should generally focus on likely scenarios plus even if we do ultimately choose to focus on a pascalian lowprobabilitybuthighimpact scenario learning more about the most likely future outcomes can better position us to find superior more likely andor more important pascalian wagers that we havent thought of yet edifices of understanding are not built on pascalian wagers as a more general point about expectedvalue calculations i think improving ones models of the world ie ones probabilities is generally more important than improving ones estimates of the values of outcomes conditional on them occurring why our current frameworks for envisioning the future may be very misguided and estimates of values of outcomes may become obsolete if our conception of what outcomes will even happen changes radically its more important to make crucial insights that will shatter our current assumptions and get us closer to truth than it is to refine value estimates within our current naive world models as an example philosophers in the middle ages would have accomplished little if they had asked what godglorifying actions to focus on by evaluating which devout obeisances would have the greatest upside value if successful such philosophers would have accomplished more if they had explored whether a god even existed of course sometimes debates on factual questions are stalled and perhaps there may be lowerhanging fruit in evaluating the prudential implications of different scenarios values of outcomes until further epistemic progress can be made on the probabilities of outcomes thanks to a friend for inspiring this pointin favor of fast takeoff a singleton is more likely thereby averting possibly disastrous conflict among ais if one prefers uncontrolled ai fast takeoffs seem more likely to produce them in favor of slow takeoff more time for many parties to participate in shaping the process compromising and developing less damaging pathways to ai takeoff if one prefers controlled ai slow takeoffs seem more likely to produce them in general there are some exceptions for instance fast takeoff of an ai built by a very careful group

number of people thinking about ai would multiply consideration of failure modes public pressure might help curb arms races in analogy with public opposition to nuclear arms races in favor of less wider attention to ai might accelerate arms races rather than inducing cooperation on more circumspect planning the public might freak out and demand counterproductive measures in response to the

subroutines in robot workers virtual scientists internal computational subcomponents of the ai etc 80 from lab experiments science investigations and explorations of mindspace without the digital equivalent of anaesthesia one reason to think lots of detailed simulations would be required here is stephen wolframs principle of computational irreducibility ecosystems brains and other systems that are important for an ai to know about may be too complex to accurately study with only simple models instead they may need to be simulated in large numbers and with finegrained detail 10 from the possibility that an uncontrolled ai would do things that humans regard as crazy or extreme such as spending all its resources on studying physics to determine whether there exists a button that would give astronomically more utility than any other outcome humans seem less likely to pursue strange behaviors of this sort of course most such strange behaviors would be not that bad from a suffering standpoint but perhaps a few possible behaviors could be extremely bad such as running astronomical numbers of painful scientific simulations to determine the answer to some question of course we should worry whether humans might also do extreme computations and perhaps their extreme computations would be more likely to be full of suffering because humans are more interested in agents with humanlike minds than a generic ai is 100 in expectation from blackswan possibilities in which the ai could manipulate physics to make the multiverse bigger last longer contain vastly more computation etc30 from suffering subroutines one reason to think these could be less bad in a humancontrolled future is that human empathy may allow for more humane algorithm designs on the other hand humancontrolled ais may need larger numbers of intelligent and sentient subprocesses because human values are more complex and varied than paperclip production is also human values tend to require continual computation eg to simulate eudaimonic experiences while paperclips once produced are pretty inert and might last a long time before they would wear out and need to be recreated of course most uncontrolled ais wouldnt produce literal paperclips some would optimize for values that would require constant computation 60 from lab experiments science investigations etc again lower than for a rogue ai because of empathy compare with efforts to reduce the pain of animal experimentation 02 if environmentalists insist on preserving terrestrial and extraterrestrial wildanimal suffering 3 for environmentalist simulations of nature 100 due to intrinsically valued simulations that may contain nasty occurrences these might include for example violent video games that involve killing conscious monsters or incidental suffering that people dont care about eg insects being eaten by spiders on the ceiling of the room where a party is happening this number is high not because i think most humaninspired simulations would contain intense suffering but because in some scenarios there might be very large numbers of simulations run for reasons of intrinsic human value and some of these might contain horrific experiences humans seem more likely than ais with random values to want to run lots of conscious simulations this video discusses one of many possible reasons why intrinsically valued humancreated simulations might contain significant suffering 15 if sadists have access to computational power humans are not only more empathetic but also more sadistic than most ais 70 in expectation from blackswan ways to increase the amount of physics that exists humans seem likely to want to do this although some might object to eg recreating the holocaust in new parts of the cosmos 50 for discovering ways to reduce suffering that we cant imagine right now black swans that dont cut both ways unfortunately humans might also respond to some black swans in worse ways than uncontrolled ais would such as by creating more total animallike mindsone species displaces another eg invasive species one ethnic group displaces another eg europeans vs native americans a countrys power rises and falls eg china formerly a superpower becoming a colony in the 1800s becoming a superpower once more in the late 1900s one product displaces another eg internet explorer vs netscape2013 countries have been deploying semiautonomous drones for several years now especially the us theres increasing pressure for militaries to adopt this technology and up to 87 countries already use drones for some purpose meanwhile military robots are also employed for various other tasks such as carrying supplies and exploding landmines militaries are also developing robots that could identify and shoot targets on command 2024 almost every country in the world now has military drones some countries have begun letting them operate fully autonomously after being given directions the us military has made significant progress on automating various other parts of its operations as well as the department of defenses 2013 unmanned systems integrated roadmap explained 11 years ago a significant amount of that manpower when it comes to operations is spent directing unmanned systems during mission performance data collection and analysis and planning and replanning therefore of utmost importance for dod is increased system sensor and analytical automation that can not only capture significant information and events but can also develop record playback project and parse out those data and then actually deliver actionable intelligence instead of just raw information militaries have now incorporated a significant amount of narrow ai in terms of pattern recognition prediction and autonomous robot navigation 2040 academic and commercial advances in agi are becoming more impressive and capturing public attention as a result the us china russia france and other major military powers begin investing more heavily in fundamental research in this area multiplying tenfold the amount of agi research conducted worldwide relative to twenty years ago many students are drawn to study agi because of the lure of lucrative highstatus jobs defending their countries while many others decry this as the beginning of skynet 2065 militaries have developed various mammallike robots that can perform basic functions via reinforcement however the robots often end up wireheading once they become smart enough to tinker with their programming and thereby fake reward signals some engineers try to solve this by penalizing ais whenever they begin to fiddle with their own source code but this leaves them unable to selfmodify and therefore reliant on their human programmers for enhancements however militaries realize that if someone could develop a successful selfmodifying ai it would be able to develop faster than if humans alone are the inventors its proposed that ais should move toward a paradigm of modelbased reward systems in which rewards do not just result from sensor neural networks that output a scalar number but rather from having a model of how the world works and taking actions that the ai believes will improve a utility function defined over its model of the external world modelbased ais refuse to intentionally wirehead because they can predict that doing so would hinder fulfillment of their utility functions of course ais may still accidentally mess up their utility functions such as through brain damage mistakes with reprogramming themselves or imperfect goal preservation during ordinary life as a result militaries build many different ais at comparable levels who are programmed to keep other ais in line and destroy them if they begin deviating from orders 2070 programming specific instructions in ais has its limits and militaries move toward a model of socializing ais that is training them in how to behave and what kinds of values to have as if they were children learning how to act in human society military roboticists teach ais what kinds of moral political and interpersonal norms and beliefs to hold the ais also learn much of this content by reading information that expresses appropriate ideological biases the training process is harder than for children because the ais dont share genetically preprogrammed moral values nor many other hardwired commonsense intuitions about how the world works but the designers begin building in some of these basic assumptions and to instill the rest they rely on extra training designers make sure to reduce the ais learning rates as they grow up so that their values will remain more fixed at older ages in order to reduce risk of goal drift as the ais perform their tasks outside of the training laboratories when they perform particularly risky operations such as reading propaganda from other countries for intelligence purposes the ais are put in readonly mode like the t800s are by skynet so that their motivations wont be affected just in case there are many ais that keep watch on each other to prevent insurrection 2085 tensions between china and the us escalate and agreement cannot be reached war breaks out initially its just between robots but as the fighting becomes increasingly dirty the robots begin to target humans as well in an effort to force the other side to back down the us avoids using nuclear weapons because the chinese ais have sophisticated antinuclear systems and have threatened total annihilation of the us in the event of attempted nuclear strike after a few days it becomes clear that china will win the conflict and the us concedes 2086 china now has a clear lead over the rest of the world in military capability rather than risking a pointlessly costly confrontation other countries grudgingly fold into chinas umbrella asking for some concessions in return for transferring their best scientists and engineers to chinas ministry of agi china continues its agi development because it wants to maintain control of the world the agis in charge of its military want to continue to enforce their own values of supremacy and protection of china so they refuse to relinquish power 2100 the world now moves so fast that humans are completely out of the loop kept around only by the filial piety that their robotic descendants hold for them now that china has triumphed the traditional focus of the ais has become less salient and theres debate about what new course of action would be most in line with the ais goals they respect their human forebearers but they also feel that because humans created ais to do things beyond human ability humans would also want the ais to carve something of their own path for the future they maintain some of the militaristic values of their upbringing so they decide that a fitting purpose would be to expand chinas empire galaxywide they accelerate colonization of space undertake extensive research programs and plan to create vast new realms of the middle kingdom in the stars should they encounter aliens they plan to quickly quash them or assimilate them into the empire 2125 the ais finally develop robust mechanisms of goal preservation and because the authoritarian selfdictatorship of the ais is strong against rebellion the ais collectively succeed in implementing goal preservation throughout their population now all of the most intelligent ais share a common goal in a manner robust against accidental mutation they proceed to expand into space they dont have concern for the vast numbers of suffering animals and robots that are simulated or employed as part of this colonization wavein practice i expect that other technologies including brain emulation nanotech etc would interact with this scenario in important ways that i havent captured also my scenario ignores the significant and possibly dominating implications of economically driven ai my scenario may be overly anthropomorphic i tried to keep some analogies to human organizational and decisionmaking systems because these have actual precedent in contrast to other hypothetical ways the ais might operate is socialization of ais realistic in a hard takeoff probably not because a rapidly selfimproving ai would amplify whatever initial conditions it was given in its programming and humans probably wouldnt have time to fix mistakes in a slower takeoff scenario where ais progress in mental ability in roughly a similar way as animals did in evolutionary history most mistakes by programmers would not be fatal allowing for enough trialanderror development to make the socialization process work if that is the route people favor historically there has been a trend in ai away from rulebased programming toward environmental training and i dont see why this shouldnt be true for an ais reward function which is still often programmed by hand at the moment however it is suspicious that the way i portrayed socialization so closely resembles human development and it may be that im systematically ignoring ways in which ais would be unlike human babiesrulebased one could present ais with written moral dilemmas the ais might employ algorithmic reasoning to extract utility numbers for different actors in the dilemma add them up and compute the utilitarian recommendation or they might aim to apply templates of deontological rules to the situation the next level would be to look at actual situations in a toymodel world and try to apply similar reasoning without the aid of a textual description supervised learning people could present the ais with massive databases of moral evaluations of situations given various predictive features the ais would guess whether a proposed action was moral or immoral or they could use regression to predict a continuous measure of how good an action was more advanced ais could evaluate a situation propose many actions predict the goodness of each and choose the best action the ais could first be evaluated on the textual training samples and later on their actions in toymodel worlds the test cases should be extremely broad including many situations that we wouldnt ordinarily think to try generative modeling ais could learn about anthropology history and ethics they could read the web and develop better generative models of humans and how their cognition works reinforcement learning ais could perform actions and humans would reward or punish them based on whether they did something right or wrong with reward magnitude proportional to severity simple ais would mainly learn dumb predictive cues of which actions to take but more sophisticated ais might develop lowdescriptionlength models of what was going on in the heads of people who made the assessments they did in essence these ais would be modeling human psychology in order to make better predictions inverse reinforcement learning inverse reinforcement learning is the problem of learning a reward function based on modeled desirable behaviors rather than developing models of humans in order to optimize given rewards in this case we would learn the reward function itself and then port it into the ais cognitive science of empathy cognitive scientists are already unpacking the mechanisms of human decisionmaking and moral judgments as these systems are better understood they could be engineered directly into ais evolution run lots of ais in toymodel or controlled real environments and observe their behavior pick the ones that behave most in accordance with human morals and reproduce them superintelligence p 187 points out a flaw with this approach evolutionary algorithms may sometimes product quite unexpected design choices if the fitness function is not thorough enough solutions may fare well against it on test cases but fail for the really hard problems not tested and if we had a really good fitness function that wouldnt accidentally endorse bad solutions we could just use that fitness function directly rather than needing evolution combinations of the above perhaps none of these approaches is adequate by itself and theyre best used in conjunction for instance evolution might help to refine and rigorously evaluate systems once they had been built with the other approacheshow much of human morality is learned vs innate by what cognitive mechanisms are young humans socialized into the norms of a society to what extent would models of human emotion and reasoning when put into ais organically generate humanlike moral behaviorit would be extremely difficult to build many independent ai systems at once with none pulling too far ahead probably some systems would excel along certain dimensions while others would excel in other ways and its not clear that it even makes sense to talk about such ais as being at roughly the same level since intelligence is not unidimensional even if this idea were feasible i doubt the first ai developers would incur the expense of following it2014 weak ai is deployed by many technology companies for image classification voice recognition web search consumer data analytics recommending facebook posts personal digital assistants pdas and copious other forms of automation theres pressure to make ais more insightful including using deep neural networks 2024 deep learning is widespread among major tech companies it allows for supervised learning with less manual feature engineering researchers develop more sophisticated forms of deep learning that can model specific kinds of systems including temporal dynamics a goal is to improve generative modeling so that learning algorithms take input and not only make immediate predictions but also develop a probability distribution over what other sorts of things are happening at the same time for instance a google search would not only return results but also give google a sense of the mood personality and situation of the user who typed it of course even in 2014 we have this in some form via google personalized search but by 2024 the modeling will be more built in to the learning architecture and less handcrafted 2035 pdas using elaborate learned models are now extremely accurate at predicting what their users want the models in these devices embody in crude form some of the same mechanisms as the users own cognitive processes people become more trusting of leaving their pdas on autopilot to perform certain mundane tasks 2065 a new generation of pdas is now sufficiently sophisticated that it has a good grasp of the users intentions it can perform tasks as well as a human personal assistant in most cases doing what the user wanted because it has a strong predictive model of the users personality and goals meanwhile researchers continue to unlock neural mechanisms of judgment decision making and value which inform those who develop cuttingedge pda architectures 2095 pdas are now essentially fullfledged copies of their owners some people have dozens of pdas working for them as well as metapdas who help with oversight some pdas make disastrous mistakes and society debates how to construe legal accountability for pda wrongdoing courts decide that owners are responsible which makes people more cautious but given the immense competitive pressure to outsource work to pdas the automation trend is not substantially affected 2110 the world moves too fast for biological humans to participate most of the world is now run by pdas which because they were built based on inferring the goals of their owners protect their owners for the most part however there remains conflict among pdas and the world is not a completely safe place 2130 pdaled countries create a world government to forestall costly wars the transparency of digital society allows for more credible commitments and enforcementbehavior and goals are more transparent and goal preservation seems easier to specify see the ethics of artificial intelligence by bostrom and yudkowsky p 16 neuromorphic ais might speed up mathematical ai leaving less time to figure out controlwe understand human psychology expectations norms and patterns of behavior mathematical ais could be totally alien and hence unpredictable if neuromorphic ais came first they could think faster and help figure out goal preservation which i assume does require mathematical ais at the end of the day mathematical ais may be more prone to unexpected breakthroughs that yield radical jumps in intelligenceauction game theory has made governments billions of dollars and is widely used in internet advertising theoretical physics has led to numerous forms of technology including electricity lasers and atomic bombs however immediate technological implications of the most theoretical forms of physics string theory higgs boson black holes etc are less pronounced formalizations of many areas of computer science have helped guide practical implementations such as in algorithm complexity concurrency distributed systems cryptography hardware verification and so on that said there are also areas of theoretical computer science that have little immediate application most software engineers only know a little bit about more abstract theory and still do fine building systems although if no one knew theory well enough to design theorybased tools the software field would be in considerably worse shapebuilding may be more fun and exciting than worrying about safety steven m bellovin observed with reference to opensource projects quality takes work design review and testing and those are not nearly as much fun as coding theres more incentive from commercial applications and government grants to build rather than

safety right now the number of brilliant altruists focused on agi safety probably exceeds the number of brilliant altruists focused on reducing suffering in the far future by several times over thus it seems plausible that there remain more lowhanging fruit for suffering reducers to focus on other crucial considerations rather than delving into the technical details of implementing agi safety i expect that agi safety will require at least say thousands of researchers and hundreds of thousands of programmers to get right agi safety is a much harder problem than ordinary computer security and computer security demand is already very high in 2012 there were more than 67400 separate postings for cybersecurityrelated jobs in a range of industries of course that agi safety will need tons of researchers eventually neednt discount the value of early work and indeed someone who helps grow the movement to a large size would contribute as much as many detailoriented agi safety researchers latermost other major problems are also already being tackled by lots of smart people agi safety is a cause that many value systems can get behind so working on it can be seen as more nice than

models of agi that miri tends to play with might be somewhat inaccurate even once true agi emergessome miri research like on decision theory is timeless pun intended and can be fruitfully started now

level better but aims to explore the theoretical limits of possibilitiesdecide if we want humancontrolled goalpreserving agi 510 years this involves exploring questions about what types of agi scenarios might unfold and how much suffering would result from agis of various types assuming we decide we do want controlled agi network with academics and agi developers to raise the topic and canvass ideas 510 years we could reach out to academic agilike projects including these listed by pei wang and these listed on wikipedia as well as to machine ethics and roboethics communities there are already some discussions about safety issues among these groups but i would expand the dialogue have private conversations write publications hold conferences etc these efforts both inform us about the lay of the land and build connections in a friendly mutualistic way lobby for greater funding of research into agi safety 1020 years once the idea and field of agi safety have become more mainstream it should be possible to differentially speed up safety research by getting more funding for it both from governments and philanthropists this is already somewhat feasible for instance in 2014 the us office of naval research announced that it would distribute 75 million in grants over five years to university researchers to study questions of machine ethics as applied to autonomous robots the movement snowballs decades its hard to plan this far ahead but i imagine that eventually within 2550 years agi safety will become a mainstream political topic in a similar way as nuclear security is today governments may take over in driving the work perhaps with heavy involvement from companies like google this is just a prediction and the actual way things unfold could be differentais should be inhibited from colonizing space or if they do colonize space they should do so in less harmful ways minimizer utility functions have less risk of creating new universes than maximizer ones do simpler utility functions eg creating uniform paperclips might require fewer suffering subroutines than complex utility functions would ais with expensive intrinsic values eg maximize paperclips may run fewer complex minds than ais with cheaper values eg create at least one paperclip on each planet because ais with cheaper values have lower opportunity cost for using resources and so can expend more of their cosmic endowment on learning about the universe to make sure theyve accomplished their goals properly thanks to a friend for this point from this standpoint suffering reducers might prefer an ai that aims to maximize paperclips over one that aims to make sure theres at least one paperclip per planet however perhaps the paperclip maximizer would prefer to create new universes while the at least one paperclip per planet ai wouldnt indeed the one paperclip per planet ai might prefer to have a smaller multiverse so that there would be fewer planets that dont contain paperclips also the satisficing ai would be easier to compromise with than the maximizing ai since the satisficers goals could be carried out more cheaply there are other possibilities to consider as well maybe an ai with the instructions to be 70 sure of having made one paperclip and then shut down all of your spacecolonization plans would not create much suffering depending on how scrupulous the ai was about making sure that what it had created was really a paperclip that it understood physics properly etcstuart armstrong agrees that aixi probably isnt a feasible approach to agi but he feels there might exist other currently undiscovered mathematical insights like aixi that could yield agi in a very short time span maybe though i think this is pretty unlikely i suppose at least a few people should explore these scenarios but plausibly most of the work should go toward pushing on the more likely outcomes back marcus hutter imagines a society of ais that compete for computing resources in a similar way as animals compete for food and space or like corporations compete for employees and market share he suggests that such competition might render initial conditions irrelevant maybe but its also quite plausible that initial conditions would matter a lot many evolutionary pathways depended sensitively on particular events eg asteroid impacts and the same is true for national corporate and memetic power back another part of the answer has to do with incentive structures eg a founder has more incentive to make a company succeed if shes mainly paid in equity than if shes paid large salaries along the way back or maybe more nikola danaylov reports rumored estimates of 50150 million for watsons rd back for atari games the current image on the screen is not all the information required because for example you need to be able to tell whether a ball is moving toward you or away from you and those two situations arent distinguishable purely based on a static snapshot therefore mnih et al 2015 used sequences of the past plus present screenshots and past actions as the state information see methods section still all of this information was readily available and representable in a clean way back what if we take the set of actions to be outputting one letter at a time rather than outputting a whole string of letters that is the set of actions is a b c z a b c z this is fewer than the number of actions that alphago considered at each step the problem is that any given sequence of letters is very unlikely to achieve a desired outcome so it will take forever to get meaningful feedback for example suppose the goal is given an input question to produce an answer that a human judge finds humorous if the answer isnt humorous the reinforcement learner gets no reward the learner would output mostly garbage say klafsfpqa qmpzrwwsa and so on it would take forever for the agent to output intelligible speech and even longer for it to output humorous speech and good luck finding a human willing to give feedback for this long or modeling a humans sense of humor well enough to provide accurate simulated feedback of course this system could be improved in various ways for example we could give it a dictionary and only let it output complete words we could train an ngram language model so that the agent would output mostly coherent speech perhaps a few other tricks could be applied so that the agent would be more likely to hit upon funny sentences but by this point weve turned a supposed generalintelligence problem into a narrowintelligence problem by specifying lots of preconfigured domain knowledge and heuristics back i prefer to use the terminology controlled and uncontrolled ai because these seem most direct and least confusing these are short for humancontrolled ai and humanuncontrolled ai'}

of the 1990s when the term ai itf fell out of favour funding decreased and the interest in the field temporarily dropped researchers concentrated on more focused goals such as machine learning

utilize large and very large arrays of processors these networks of processors will be available on a lease or purchase basis they will be architected to form parallel processing ensembles they will allow for reconfigurable topologies such as nearest neighbor based meshes rings or trees they will be available via an internet or wifi connection a user will have access to systems whose power will rival that of governments in the 1980s or 1990s because of the nature of nearest neighbor topology higher dimension hypercubes eg d10 or d20 can be assembled on an adhoc basis as necessary a d10

speech recognition systems computer vision text analysis robot control planning humans excel at creating real world plans on a daily basis seemingly effortlessly a review of the problem of creating a problem however will reveal that the creation of a real world plan requires a vast amount of knowlege about the real world consider for instance that a friend asks to be met at the tate museum in london 21 days hence the meeting should be in time for lunch at a restaurant within walking distance of the museum an agreement to make the meeting would require a plan that takes many things into consideration for instance if you were to agree to meet your friend at the tate museum and you were situated in north america then you would first have to realize that there are no bridges to england it is not possible to walk there likewise it is not possible to take a train one might take an ocean liner or one might fly entering england requires authentic identification papers therefore a passport is required were you a us citizen then you would be obliged to acquire a passport if you did not already have one delays are associated with acquiring a passport the us government is not driven by the profit motive therefore a wait of several weeks might not be unreasonable british is a soverign nation it has its own legal system as well as its own legal tender the british pound one would therefore be obliged to convert us dollars into british pounds prior to making the trip or immediately upon arrival the us dollar floats relative to other currencies one would therefore need to account for exchange rate shifts britain is in a time zone that is advanced by 6 hours from that of east coast time us upon arriving therefore one might find oneself psychologically and physiologically off balance hence resting might be in order one will very likely not rest in a public place but acquire accommodations the tate museum is not a hotel therefore one could not rest there for the time needed and on it goes in order to make a simple yes or no answer to making the meeting one must factor in a huge amount of real world knowledge enabling machines to create real world ad hoc plans therefore requires that an extensive knowledge base be created to account for the combinatorial explosion that typically arises when trying to move forward plan recognition a computing system that is capable of recognizing the plan that an actor or agent is formulating is in the position of either assisting in implementing the plan or maybe able to thwart the plan henry kautz plan recognition using kautz system one can create a knowledge base about a specific domain the expert system that uses this knowledge base is then able to recognize the activity in question and make inferences about the state of completion of the plan sufficiently robust plan recognizers can identify the actions of both individual agents but also teams of agents all of whom may be actively attempting to coordinate their efforts to accoplish a goal expert systems these information systems draw upon several areas of artificial intelligence to perform their operations developing an expert system requires an understanding of knowledge representation human knowledge can be represented as production rules ie simple or complex ifthen combinations if antecedentconsequent constructions first order logical constructions such as likesmary wine or extended representations called frames frames represent human knowledge as objects that have attributes which have values these ova combinations can be assembled into recursive structures that map very closely to their real world counterparts knowledge about the world and the functioning of these objects can then be applied to real world situations knowledge is not always exact therefore a robust knowledge representation scheme need to have some for of representing ambiguity fuzzy logic is a way of capturing ambiguity about a real world phenomena for instance one might make the observation that a man it tall because he stands 6 feet 2 inches in height would a man who is 6 feet 1 inch still tall a man who is 6 feet and 12 inches fuzzy logic enables ranges of confidence to be expressed about a particular object or rule once some form of representation scheme is identified an inferencing strategy is required humans use both forwardchaining and backwardchaining strategies they often use combinations of the two to solve complex problems problems that require identification from a few facts is a typical use of forwardchaining a forwardchainer can be provided with a small set of facts about a situation or object and reason about the problem for instance an opthomologist can quickly assess the type of problem that a patient presents just based upon a few facts and observations the problem can quickly be identified and classified as to whether it is caused by trauma infection toxicity congential or systemic eg detached retina as a result of high blood pressure a backwardchaining system can create theories a famous backwardchainer was sherlock holmes holmes was presented with a finished result a person might have been murdered under mysterious circumstances holmes was able to reason backward from the presented corpse to how the person ended up in a terminal state he created theories based upon observations and knowledlge about the real world in order to rapidly achieve a goal or formulate a correct theory means that the chainer utilize operators and metaoperators solving a rubiks cube requires the use of both this is because the act of putting a rubiks cube back in order involves interactingsubgoals ie partial goals that conflict with solving the larger puzzle operators and metaoperators are used to navigate the search space and constrain the combinatorial explosion that results when one attempts to solve a problem knowledge can be characterized in terms of the strength of the knowledge this characterization is described as fhat ie the letter f with a carat over it the more effective the knowledge the less time is required to traverse the spacegoogle intelligence distribution agent ida developed for the us navy helps assign sailors new jobs at the end of their tours of duty by negotiating with them via email systems that trade stocks and commodities without human intervention banking software for approving bank loans and detecting credit card fraud developed by fair isaac corp search engines such as brain boost or even google intelligent robots such as asimo qrio aibo intelligent help systems capable of providing context sensitive help to software system users these systems are able to infer the correct level of help needed to provide because they can a make inferences about the level of skill of the user and b utilize deep knowledge about the software application itself using these areas of knowledge it is possible to identify the types of mistakes that users of varying skill levels are likely to make novice users who have no conceptual insight into an application tend to make syntactic and semantic mistakes niaive users tend to make more semantic mistakes whereas expert users tend to make thematic mistakes ie inferring incorrectly that one way of assembling commands to solve a particular problem can be generalized to solve another problem using a comparable sequence of commands intelligent help to operators of complex and potentially dangerous industrial process such as nuclear power plants human operators of high risk industrial processes have limited attention span and typically perform poorly in situations where cascades of sequential problem sets can result in an inappropriate remedy common sense reasoning an ongoing example is the project called cyc cyc attempts to capture and use knowledge about the world to performing reasoning about specific topics cyc drives its inferencing capability by using an encyclopediac amount of knowlege about the world its current knowlege base consists of 300000 concepts 3000000 assertions and 26000 relations 072008 cyc can further be trained by interaction with humans in the outside world cycs ability to reason can be characterized by taking for instance a picture of a group of people this group of people can be occupationally characterized by their attire among the people is an athelete who very evidently has just run a foot race for an extended period of time cyc can be queried as to which one is wet cyc can correctly infer that people who physically

intelligence is one of the hot topics that it industry is hovering around these days we know what the word ‘intelligence’ concerns about it is the ability to perceive understand predict and manipulate to solve problems in a world far larger and complicated than the degree of knowledge that one possess have you ever thought what if machines acquire this human capability of intelligence and start performing human tasks which require intelligencethe advancements in the fields of artificial intelligence and advanced machine learning can make this distant dream a reality in the coming few years from selfdriving cars to virtual assistants like siri cortana and ibm’s jeopardy defeating watson the science and engineering of creating intelligent machines or intelligent computer programs holds the potential to redefine the global it world the recent triumph of google’s ai machine ‘deep mind’ over a human in one of the complex board games of ‘go’ took the tech world into a surprise this triumph of machine learning over the human intelligence sets apart more faith in the upcoming revolution in the ai world as the relationship between humans and machines becomes more collaborative and as machines gain intelligence to perform human tasks and routine activities without step by step guidance we can say artificial intelligence hold the power to change the way we do things currentlythe tech world’s aspirations to make machines understand and emulate human brain capabilities dates back to centuries it is even surprising to know that the historical roots of ai can be traced back to greek mythology however the term artificial intelligence or ai is coined by john mccarthy in 1956ai is a broad topic which can be broken down into subcategories the three main categories of ai includesartificial narrow intelligence ani ani is the weakest form of artificial intelligence the machines with ani capabilities can do a single task only for example if the machine is intended to do chess game it won’t be able to do anything else ani machines use a logic driven process to replicate human actions it sifts through massive amounts of information and accurately extracts the relevant information many of the ai applications that we see currently are based on aniartificial general intelligence agi agi machines hold strong intelligence or match with human level intelligence agi machines can successfully perform any intelligent tasks that a human being can do agi can be applied contextually where it use cognitive capabilities to arrive at decisions like human beings it can simulate human reasoning and can extend it capabilities to a broad range of circumstances we are still in the early stages of implementing agi for addressing many real world problemsartificial super intelligence asiasi machines are much smarter and faster than the best human brains in every field that human beings excel it is considered to be the greatest opportunity for human beings at the same time industry experts are concerning that whether it can become the greatest threat as wellartificial intelligence can play a key role in the sectors like healthcare agriculture personal care home automation banking and transportation currently ai in its very basic form is influencing human life in the form of automated cars virtual assistants image recognition software computer driven online conversations and so on all these are instances of ai’s role in the betterment of human life we can also see a lot of global interest among the technological advancements like cognitive computing machine learning and natural language processing these are all small journeys to make machines smarter and selfadaptable compared to the old spoon fed preprogrammed computing deviceseven though today the role of ai is confined to specific narrow tasks and they don’t have adaptable intelligence that humans exhibit the influence of ai is drastically growing research and markets a leading market research organizations artificial intelligence market global forecast to 2020 report states that “the artificial intelligence market is estimated to grow from usd 4197 million in 2014 to usd 505 billion by 2020 at a cagr of 5365 from 2015 to 2020 ai holds the power to redefine the current work environment in it enterprises especially the way knowledge capital and people capital are deployed as labor force adapts to the demands of a new technology revolution it leads to economic prosperity as well it brings in tremendous opportunities in enterprises to deploy knowledge and people towards value creation as opposed to process management to tap this huge potential technology companies in india and abroad have started offering artificial intelligence platform as a solution or as a service aiaaswith ai getting more mature let us expect humans will get more empowered with selflearning machines that can create a smarter competition with the human brains and that will probably redefine the

attempt to mimic human levels of intelligenceartificial intelligence henceforth written as ai in this article and computing are inexorably linked and whether or not you realize it ai plays a huge role in our everyday lives realistically its less hal 9000 and more iphone x here’s a brief rundown of where ai originated where it is today and where its headed in the futuresince the dawn of computing in the mid20th century ai has been top of mind for many computer scientists the discipline was outlined and formalized at dartmouth college in 1956 immediately afterward the industry saw an avalanche of funding and it looked as if artificial humanlevel intelligence was on the horizonearly ais were tasked with solving mazes communicating in simple sentences and navigating rudimentary robotsyet after 20 years the promise of nearhuman intelligence hadn’t arrived limited computing power made many complex tasks impossible and as public support began to waver so too did the funding most importantly researchers had overpromised and underdelivered which turned off investorsa second boom in the 80s saw the rise of computers that could make decisions based on a preprogrammed set of problems and still these ai were too dumb they lacked practical applications so the industry suffered another bust a few years laterthen a new class of artificial intelligence began to emerge machine learning in which computers learn and improve from experience instead of needing to be specifically programmed for a task in 1997 as a result of machine learning artificial intelligence a supercomputer beat a human opponent in chess for the first time and just 14 years later a computer named watson defeated two human competitors in jeopardythe early 2000s through today have been a high water mark for artificial intelligence other subsets of artificial intelligence have spawned including data mining neural networks and deep learning with everfaster computers able to perform more complex tasks ai has seen a huge resurgence and has become an important part of everyday life affecting everything from your drive to work to the cat gif you just shared with your momtoday artificial intelligence has found boundless applications research focuses on just about any application but robots autonomous vehicles and even drones are among the best knownsimulations and simulated environments are another area that have benefited from increased computing power indeed some video game simulations have become so detailed and realistic that its led some to postulate that we must be living in a computer simulationfinally language learning is one of the more ambitious and difficult ai projects being worked on today sure siri can respond to a question with a preprogrammed response but the type of conversations you saw in interstellar between tars and matthew mcconaugheys character are still a ways outwhile movies like the terminator and the matrix have convinced some people that maybe we shouldn’t be teaching computers how to think researchers are more focused on creating c3pos and walles helpful ai like driverless cars smartphones and homes that predict your every need and even robots that deliver groceries are all just around the cornerand as we push out further into the stars aicontrolled robots will be invaluable in exploring worlds too hostile for humanssome experts like

recent years todays successful ai systems and where ai may be headedthis is the full report what is artificial intelligence by mike loukides and ben lorica a downloadable edition is also availabledefining artificial intelligence isn’t just difficult it’s impossible not the least because we don’t really understand human intelligence paradoxically advances in ai will help more to define what human intelligence isn’t than what artificial intelligence isbut whatever ai is we’ve clearly made a lot of progress in the past few years in areas ranging from computer vision to game playing ai is making the transition from a research topic to the early stages of enterprise adoption companies such as google and facebook have placed huge bets on ai and are already using it in their products but google and facebook are only the beginning over the next decade we’ll see ai steadily creep into one product after another we’ll be communicating with bots rather than scripted robodialers and not realizing that they aren’t human we’ll be relying on cars to plan routes and respond to road hazards it’s a good bet that in the next decades some features of ai will be incorporated into every application that we touch and that we won’t be able to do anything without touching an applicationgiven that our future will inevitably be tied up with ai it’s imperative that we ask where are we now what is the state of ai and where are we headingdescriptions of ai span several axes strength how intelligent is it breadth does it solve a narrowly defined problem or is it general training how does it learn capabilities what kinds of problems are we asking it to solve and autonomy are ais assistive technologies or do they act on their own each of these axes is a spectrum and each point in this manydimensional space represents a different way of understanding the goals and capabilities of an ai systemon the strength axis it’s very easy to look at the results of the last 20 years and realize that we’ve made some extremely powerful programs deep blue beat garry kasparov in chess watson beat the best jeopardy champions of all time alphago beat lee sedol arguably the world’s best go player but all of these successes are limited deep blue watson and alphago were all highly specialized singlepurpose machines that did one thing extremely well deep blue and watson can’t play go and alphago can’t play chess or jeopardy even on a basic level their intelligence is very narrow and can’t be generalized a lot of work has gone into using watson for applications such as medical diagnosis but it’s still fundamentally a questionandanswer machine that must be tuned for a specific domain deep blue has a lot of specialized knowledge about chess strategy and an encyclopedic knowledge of openings alphago was built with a more general architecture but a lot of handcrafted knowledge still made its way into the code i don’t mean to trivialize or undervalue their accomplishments but it’s important to realize what they haven’t donewe haven’t yet created an artificial general intelligence that can solve a multiplicity of different kinds of problems we still don’t have a machine that can listen to recordings of humans for a year or two and start speaking while alphago “learned” to play go by analyzing thousands of games and then playing thousands more against itself the same software couldn’t be used to master chess the same general approach probably but our best current efforts are far from a general intelligence that is flexible enough to learn without supervision or flexible enough to choose what it wants to learn whether that’s playing board games or designing pc boardshow do we get from narrow domainspecific intelligence to more general intelligence by “general intelligence” we don’t necessarily mean human intelligence but we do want machines that can solve different kinds of problems without being programmed with domainspecific knowledge we want machines that can make human judgments and decisions that doesn’t necessarily mean that ai systems will implement concepts like creativity intuition or instinct which may have no digital analogs a general intelligence would have the ability to follow multiple pursuits and to adapt to unexpected situations and a general ai would undoubtedly implement concepts like “justice” and “fairness” we’re already talking about the impact of ai on the legal systema selfdriving car demonstrates the problems we’re facing to be selfdriving a car needs to integrate pattern recognition with other capabilities including reasoning planning and memory it needs to recognize patterns so it can react to obstacles and street signs it needs to reason both to understand driving regulations and to solve problems like avoiding obstacles it needs to plan a route from its current location to its destination taking into account traffic and other patterns it needs to do all of these repeatedly updating its solutions constantly however even though a selfdriving car incorporates just about all of ai it doesn’t have the flexibility we’d expect from a general intelligence system you wouldn’t expect a selfdriving car to have a conversation or lay out your garden transfer learning or taking results from one area and applying them to another is very difficult you could probably reengineer many of the software components but that only points out what’s missing our current ais provide narrow solutions to specific problems they aren’t general problem solvers you can add narrow ais ad infinitum a car could have a bot that talks about where to go that makes restaurant recommendations that plays chess with you so you don’t get bored but a pile of narrow intelligences will never add up to a general intelligence general intelligence isnt about the number of abilities but about integration between those abilitieswhile approaches like neural networks were originally developed to mimic the human brain’s processes many ai initiatives have given up on the notion of imitating a biological brain we don’t know how brains work neural networks are computationally useful but they’re not imitating human thought in artificial intelligence a modern approach peter norvig and stuart russell write that “the quest for ‘artificial flight’ succeeded when the wright brothers and others stopped imitating birds and started … learning about aerodynamics” similarly to make progress ai need not focus on imitating the brain’s biological processes and instead try to understand the problems that the brain solves it’s a safe bet that humans use any number of techniques to learn regardless of what may be happening on the biological level the same will probably be true of a general artificial intelligence it will use pattern matching like alphago it will use rulebased systems like watson it will use exhaustive search trees like deep blue none of these techniques map directly onto human intelligence what humans appear to do better than any computer is to build models of their world and act on those modelsthe next step past general intelligence is superintelligence or hyperintelligence it’s not clear how to distinguish superintelligence from general intelligence would we expect a superintelligence system to possess qualities like creativity and initiative given that we have trouble understanding human creativity it’s hard to think of machine creativity as a useful concept go experts described some of alphago’s moves as “creative” however they came out of exactly the same processes and patterns as all the other moves not from looking at the game in a different way repeated application of the same algorithms can produce results that humans find surprising or unexpected but merely being surprising isn’t what we call “creativity”it’s easier to think of superintelligence as a matter of scale if we can create “general intelligence” it’s easy to assume that it could quickly become thousands of times more powerful than human intelligence or more precisely either general intelligence will be significantly slower than human thought and it will be difficult to speed it up either through hardware or software or it will speed up quickly through massive parallelism and hardware improvements we’ll go from thousandcore gpus to trillions of cores on thousands of chips with data streaming in from billions of sensors in the first case when speedups are slow general intelligence might not be all that interesting though it will have been a great ride for the researchers in the second case the rampup will be very steep and very fastalphago’s developers claimed to use a much more general approach to ai than deep blue they produced a system that had minimal knowledge of go strategy but instead learned by observing go games that points toward the next big direction can we get from supervised learning where a machine is trained on labeled data to unsupervised learning where a machine learns for itself how to group and structure datain a post on facebook yann lecun says “we need to solve the unsupervised learning problem before we can even think of getting to true ai” to classify photos an ai system is given millions of photos that have already been classified correctly after learning from these classifications it’s given another set of tagged photos to determine whether it can tag the test set correctly what can a machine do without tagging can it discover what’s important in a photo without metadata telling it “this is a bird this is a plane this is a flower” can a machine discover structure by observation with much less data something that both humans and animals can doboth humans and animals can form models and abstractions from relatively little data it doesn’t take millions of images for us to recognize a new kind of bird for example or to find our way around a new city predicting future frames of a video a problem researchers are now working on would require an ai system to build an understanding of how the world works is it possible to develop a system that can respond to completely new situations such as a car sliding unpredictably on ice is it possible to build a car that can drive without the benefit of a map humans can solve these problems though they’re not necessarily good at it unsupervised learning points to problems that can’t just be solved by better faster hardware or by developers working with the current librariesthere are approaches to learning that represent a point between supervised and unsupervised learning in reinforcement learning the system is given some value that represents a reward can a robot run across a field without falling can a car drive across town without a map rewards can be fed back into the system and used to maximize the probability of success openai gym is a promising framework for reinforcement learningat one extreme supervised learning means reproducing a set of tags which is essentially pattern recognition and prone to overfitting at the other extreme completely unsupervised learning means learning to reason inductively about a situation and requires algorithmic breakthroughs semisupervised learning with minimal tags or reinforcement learning by sequential decision making represent approaches between these extremes we’ll see how far they can take uswhat we mean by “intelligence” is a fundamental question in a radar post from 2014 beau cronin did an excellent job of summarizing the many definitions of ai what we expect from artificial intelligence depends critically on what we want the ai to do discussions of ai almost always start with the turing test turing assumed that people would interact with a computer through a chatlike model he assumed a conversation with the computer this assumption places limitations on what we expect the computer to do we don’t expect it to drive cars or assemble circuits for example it’s also an intentionally ambiguous test the computer’s answers might be evasive or just plain incorrect being unerringly correct isn’t the point human intelligences are also evasive and incorrect wed be unlikely to mistake an ai that was unerringly correct for a humanif we assume that ai must be embodied in hardware that’s capable of motion such as a robot or an autonomous vehicle we get a different set of criteria we’re asking the computer to perform a poorly defined task like driving to the store under its own control we can already build ai systems that can do a better job of planning a route and driving than most humans the one accident in which one of google’s autonomous vehicles was at fault occurred because the algorithms were modified to drive more like a human and to take risks that the ai system would not normally have takenthere are plenty of difficult driving problems that selfdriving cars haven’t solved driving on a mountain road in a blizzard for example whether the ai system is embodied in a car a drone aircraft or a humanoid robot the problems it will face will be essentially similar how to perform in safe comfortable circumstances will be easy how to perform in highrisk dangerous situations will be much harder humans aren’t good at those tasks either but while turing would expect an ai in conversation to be evasive or even answer questions incorrectly vague or incorrect solutions while driving down a highway aren’t acceptableais that can take physical action force us to think about robotic behavior what sort of ethics govern autonomous robots asimov’s laws of robotics if we think a robot should never kill or injure a human weaponized drones have already thrown that out the window while the stereotypical question “if an accident is unavoidable should an autonomous car crash into the baby or the grandmother” is fake ethics there are versions of the question that are more serious should a selfdriving car plunge into a crowd to avoid an accident that might kill its passenger it’s easy to answer the question in the abstract but it’s hard to imagine humans buying a vehicle that will sacrifice them rather than injure bystanders i doubt the robots will be expected to answer this question but it will certainly be discussed in the board rooms of ford gm toyota and teslawe can define ai more simply by dispensing with the intricacies of conversational systems or autonomous robotic systems and saying that ai is solely about building systems that answer questions and solve problems systems that can answer questions and reason about complex logic are the “expert systems” that we’ve been building for some years now most recently embodied in watson alphago solves a different kind of problem however as beau cronin points out solving problems that humans find intellectually challenging is relatively easy what’s much more difficult is solving the problems that humans find easy few three year olds can play go all three year olds can recognize their parents—and without a substantial set of tagged imageswhat we mean by “intelligence” depends strongly on what we want that intelligence to do there is no single definition that’s adequate for all of our goals without welldefined goals that tell us what we’re trying to achieve and let us measure whether we’ve achieved it the transition from narrow ai to general ai is not going to be easypress coverage of ai focuses on autonomous systems machines that act on their own with good reason that’s the fun sexy and somewhat scary face of ai it’s easy to watch alphago with a human servant to make its moves and fantasize about a future dominated by machines but there’s something more to ai than autonomous devices that make humans obsolete where is the real value artificial intelligence or intelligence augmentation ai or ia that question has been asked since the first attempts at ai and is explored in depth by john markoff in machines of loving grace we may not want an ai system to make decisions we may want to reserve decision making for ourselves we may want ai that augments our intelligence by providing us with information predicting the consequences of any course of action and making recommendations but leaving decisions to the humans the matrix notwithstanding a future in which artificial intelligence is at our service augmenting our intelligence rather than overruling it is much more likely than a future in which we’re the servants of an overreaching aia gps navigation system is an excellent example of an ai system that augments human intelligence given a good map most humans can navigate from point a to point b though our abilities leave a lot to be desired particularly if we’re in unfamiliar territory plotting the best route between two locations is a difficult problem particularly when you account for problems like bad traffic and road conditions but with the exception of autonomous vehicles we’ve never connected the navigation engine to the steering wheel a gps is strictly an assistive technology it gives recommendations not commands whenever you hear the gps saying “recalculating route” a human has made a decision or a mistake that ignored the gps recommendation and the gps is adaptingover the past few years we’ve seen many applications that qualify as ai in one sense or another almost anything that falls under the rubric of “machine learning” qualifies as artificial intelligence indeed “machine learning” was the name given to the more successful parts of ai back when the discipline fell into disrepute you don’t have to build something with a human voice like amazon’s alexa to be ai amazon’s recommendation engine is certainly ai so is a web application like stitchfix which augments choices made by fashion experts with choices made by a recommendation engine we’ve become accustomed to and are frequently annoyed by chat bots that handle customer service calls more or less accurately you’ll probably end up talking to a human but the secret is using the chat bot to get all the routine questions out of the way there’s no point in requiring a human to transcribe your address your policy number and other standard information a computer can do it at least as accurately if not morethe next generation of assistants will be and already is semiautonomous several years ago larry page said the star trek computer was the ideal search engine it was a computer that understood humans had already digested all the information available and could answer questions before they were even asked if you have used google now you were probably surprised the first time it told you to leave early for an appointment because the traffic was bad that requires looking across several different data sets your current location the location of your appointment probably in your calendar or in your contacts list google’s mapping data current traffic conditions and even chronological data about expected traffic patterns the goal isn’t answering a question it’s providing assistance before users even know they need itwhy is ai currently such a hot topic after having being in disrepute for a few decades of “ai winter” of course ai was in the news briefly after deep blue and again after watson but these fads didn’t last it’s tempting to see the current rise of ai as another fad that would ignore the changes of the past decadethe rise of ai has depended on tremendous advances in computer hardware it’s tedious to recite the huge advances in performance and storage technology in the 30 years since the start of the ai winter which wikipedia traces to 1984 but that’s an unavoidable part of the story particularly if you’ve seen the racks of machines that made up ibm’s watson alphago reportedly ran on 1920 cpus and 280 gpus the machine that beat lee sedol may have been even larger and used custom hardware google has developed for building neural networks even if ai algorithms are too slow to be productive on a typical laptop it’s easy and relatively inexpensive to allocate some serious computing horsepower on cloud platforms like aws gce and azure and machine learning was enabled in part by the ability to store vast amounts of data in 1985 gigabytes were rare and weighed hundreds of pounds now gigabytes are commonplace inexpensive and tinyin addition to the ability to store and process data we now have the ability to generate data in the 80s most photography was analog now it’s all digital and a lot of it is stored online in services like flickr google photos apple photos facebook and more many online photos are already tagged with some descriptive text making them a great dataset for training ai systems many of our conversations are also online through facebook twitter and many chat services as are our shopping histories so we or more precisely google apple yahoo facebook amazon and others have the data needed to train ai systemswe’ve also made significant advances in algorithms neural networks aren’t particularly new but “deep learning” stacks up a series of networks with feedback so the network automatically trains itself deep learning thus tries to solve one of the hardest human problems in machine learning learning optimal representations and features from data processing a lot of data is easy but feature learning is more of an art than a science deep learning automates some of that artnot only have we made progress in algorithms the algorithms are implemented in widely available libraries such as caffe tensorflow theano scikitlearn mxnet cntk and others ai isn’t limited to cs researchers in academic settings increasingly anyone can take part as pete warden has shown you don’t need to know how to implement a complex algorithm and make it run reasonably well on your hardware you just need to know how to install a library and tag training data just as the pc revolution itself took place when computers moved out of machine rooms and became accessible to the general public the same process of democratization is producing a revolution in ai as people from many backgrounds and environments experiment with ai we’ll see new kinds of applications some will seem like science fiction though selfdriving cars seemed like science fiction only a few years ago there will certainly be new applications that we can’t even imaginethe world is full of “dark data” unstructured information that doesn’t live in nice orderly databases it’s on websites buried in tables enshrined in photographs and movies but it’s not easily accessible to machine intelligence or to any other intelligence projects like diffbot and deepdive use semisupervised learning to find the structure in unstructured data—whether masses of scientific papers or the scrapings of many websites once they’ve created a database that database can be accessed by moreconventional tools whether apis sql statements or desktop applicationsknowledge databases and graphs are already in use in many intelligent applications including google’s knowledge graph as we move toward conversational applications the ability to unearth dark data and find structure in it will become even more critical using dark data effectively will be the key to moving from scripted and narrowly purposed chat applications to applications that can take an arbitrary question and return an answer to the user we might not see such an application as “understanding” the question but applications like this will be at the heart of future assistive technologies and they will rely on knowledge databases that have been scraped and structured by machine the sheer volume of data involved will be beyond humans’ tagging abilitiesunlike the dark times of the ai winter when data was limited and computers were slow we’re seeing successful ai systems everywhere google translate is nowhere near as good as a human translator but it frequently gives you a usable translation while it hasn’t been on the radar anywhere near as much speech recognition systems are also commonplace and surprisingly accurate a year ago google claimed that an android phone could correctly understand 92 of the questions it was asked given that a computer can correctly turn a question into text the next step is to turn that question into an answersimilarly image recognition and image processing have become commonplace despite some highly publicized and embarrassing mistakes computer vision systems can identify faces with an accuracy that was unthinkable a few years ago granted constraining the problem properly plays a huge role in this success facebook can identify faces in your photos because it’s assuming that the people in your photos are likely to be your friends computer vision is or will be central to many applications of ai from the mundane to the scary vision is obviously critical to autonomous vehicles it’s also critical to surveillance autotargeting drones and other uncomfortable applicationsdeep learning and neural networks have attracted a lot of attention in the past year they have enabled progress in computer vision natural language and other fields however almost anything that falls under the rubric of machine learning is artificial intelligence classification and clustering algorithms various kinds of decision trees genetic algorithms support vector machines hierarchical temporal memory and many others these techniques can be used by themselves or in combination with others ibm’s watson is a good example of ensemble learning it is a rulebased system that incorporates many other algorithms depending on the problem it is solving the rules are largely handcrafted and the other algorithms need to be painstakingly tuned to get good resultsimpressive as watson is systems that require huge amounts of hand tuning are at best a stepping stone toward intelligence any general ai and most narrow ais will probably combine many algorithms rather than using a single yettobediscovered master algorithm but the tuning required to get good results is a major limitation demis hassabis leader of the alphago team says that tuning is “almost like an art form” is it really “artificial intelligence” if getting good results requires years of work and only a few specialists hassabis says a few hundred are capable of doing that work the creation of an engine like watson is science but it also requires a lot of art in addition the need for manual optimization suggests that ais built this way are inherently narrow designed to solve a single problem it’s very difficult to imagine optimizing a “general intelligence” engine that can work on any problem if you’re optimizing you’re almost certainly optimizing for something for some specific applicationdo advances in ai depend on better algorithms or better hardware the answer to that question is “both” if the question is even meaningful even though clock speeds have stalled our ability to put more and more on a chip hasn’t stalled alphago’s 280 gpus could easily mean 200000 cores more important though we’ve seen a lot of improvement in mathematical libraries and tools for using gpus we may also see the use of asics and fpgas applicationspecific integrated circuit and fieldprogrammable gate arrays in future ai engines in turn asics and fpgas will be critical to embedding ai in hardware systems many of which think autonomous vehicles will need to run in hard realtimebut even if the hardware is better we will still need algorithms that can be distributed across thousands or millions of nodes we will need algorithms that can reprogram fpgas on the fly to adapt the hardware to the problems they are solving mapreduce became popular for data analysis because it suggested a way to parallelize a large class of problems parallelism obviously works for ai but what are its limits the hard fact of parallelism is that the part of the program that can’t be parallelized kills you and the hallmark of most parallel algorithms is that you need a phase that collects partial results and generates a single result alphago may look at thousands of alternatives when computing its next move but at some point it needs to look at all the alternatives evaluate which is best and present a single result alphago can take advantage of 280 gpus what about a machine with 280000 after all the largest ai systems we’ve built so far are a small fraction of the size of a rat brain let alone a human brain what about algorithms that don’t lend themselves to parallelism as well as neural networks how do you apply feedback in systems where each element of the pipeline is taking a different approach to the problem questions like these are likely to drive ai research in the near futurethrowing more and faster hardware at ai algorithms is likely to get us better go chess and jeopardy players we’ll be able to classify images better and faster but that’s an improvement in the problems we can currently solve will more computing power get us from supervised to unsupervised learning will it lead us from narrow intelligence to general intelligence that remains to be seen unsupervised learning is a hard problem and it’s not clear that it can be solved just by throwing more hardware at it we’re still looking for a “master algorithm” that may not existit is easy to get scared by talk of superhuman intelligence and according to some it is time to decide what we want our machines to do before it’s too late while this position may be oversimplified it is very difficult to think about limiting devices that we can’t build and whose capabilities we can’t imagine now and may never understand in the future it is also difficult to say “no” because i’m not aware of any technology that hasn’t been invented because people thought better of it beforehand at different times in history people were afraid of many technologies that are now commonplace at one point many thought that traveling over 60 miles per hour would be fatal socrates was opposed to writing because he thought it would lead to forgetfulness imagine what he would have thought of our technologybut we can think about the future of ai and how we will develop machines that assist us here are a few suggestionsmost fears of a superintelligent ai aren’t really fears of a machine we neither know or understand they are fears about human nature at its worst coupled with unlimited power we don’t imagine a machine that thinks thoughts we can’t comprehend we imagine an unbeatable hitler or stalin whose thoughts we do comprehend our fears are essentially human fears fears of omnipotent machines acting like humansthat isn’t to denigrate our fears because we’ve seen that machine learning does learn from us microsoft’s unfortunate tay was a tooperfect example of a conversational ai bot that “learned” racism and bigotry from the people it talked to online google’s image classification that identified a black couple as “gorillas” was the result of poor testing and a training set that didn’t have enough properly tagged pictures of black people machines learn to be racist much the same way that humans do because we teach them to be that way whether intentionally or accidentally that’s a human problem and it’s one that’s solvable we can be more careful about what and how our artificial intelligences learn we can be more careful about what’s in our training sets how those sets are tagged and we can filter what kinds of answers we consider acceptable none of this is terribly difficult it just has to be done what’s more difficult in the current climate is reaching a consensus that racism and hatred are not okthat’s a problem of human values not machine intelligence we can build machines that reflect our values we do that already are they the values that we want to reflect the white house’s report on data science big risks big opportunities the intersection of big data and civil rights concludes with a section on the need for research on how to audit algorithms to “ensure that people are being treated fairly” as we move from “big data” to ai the need to audit our algorithms and make sure they reflect values we support will only increaseit is extremely important that research into artificial intelligence be open and visible to the public not because we believe the public will be less “afraid” of research that happens in the open that may or may not be true or because the public will somehow become “used to” the idea of superintelligence but because there is greater concern about research that goes on behind closed doors versus research that goes on in public indeed unethical research suggests that the best way to create a healthy ai ecosystem is to publish ideas for creating malevolent machines research will continue to go on behind closed doors it would be naive to think that military research and intelligence services aren’t working on artificial intelligence but we will be at the mercy of that research if there isn’t also ai research happening in the public sphere whether an organization such as google or facebook constitutes “behind closed doors” or “in public view” is a debate worth having that’s the point of openai “to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole unconstrained by a need to generate financial return” openai is a dramatic and surprising answer to the fear of ai push ai research forward as far as possible but in public make sure that the public sphere remains ahead of closeddoor aiit is also important for research to be open and in the public sphere because research’s origins often determine its application nuclear energy is a good example it’s possible to build safe efficient nuclear reactors that are fueled by thorium but thorium reactors were never built because they don’t help you build bombs and research into nuclear power was under the control of the defense department a reactor that doesn’t generate plutonium in usable quantities why would anyone want that again it’s naive to think that military and national intelligence services won’t do excellent ai research but if ai research becomes the sole province of the military we will have excellent autotargeting drones if ai research becomes the sole province of national intelligence we will have excellent systems for surreptitiously listening to and understanding conversations our imaginations will be limited about what else ai might do for us and we will have trouble imagining ai applications other than murderous drones and the watchful ear of big brother we may never develop intelligent medical systems or robotic nurses’ aidesif we want ai to serve humanity it must be developed in public as part of the larger community of ai researchers and as part of a wider public discourse about our goals and aims we must be careful not to build our own worst nightmare but we need to realize that the nightmare is really just a more powerful version of ourselvesmark zuckerberg recently said that ai will be better than humans at most basic tasks in 5 to 10 years he may be correct but it’s also clear that he’s talking about narrow intelligence specific tasks like speech recognition image classification and of course game playing he continues to say “that doesnt mean that the computers will be thinking” depending on who you talk to a real general intelligence is 10 to 50 years out given the difficulty of predicting the future of technology the best answer is “more than 10 years” and possibly much more when will humanlevel machine intelligence hlmi be achieved a recent survey of experts suggests that hlmi will occur with 50 probability sometime between 20402050 as yann lecun says “humanlevel general ai is several decades away”so when will we get there if ever a few years ago jason huggins hugs made a prescient remark about robots robots he said are always in the future from time to time bits of robotics break off and become part of the present but when that happens they’re no longer considered robotics in the 1920s we would have considered a modern dishwasher a superintelligent robot now it’s just a dishwasherthe same will inevitably happen for artificial intelligence indeed it is already happening i have avoided making a distinction between machine learning and ai “machine learning” is a term that was applied to ideas from ai research back when ai was disreputable now many of those ideas are commonplace we don’t think twice about amazon recommendations or gps navigation systems we take those for granted we may find facebook and google’s ability to tag photos creepy but we don’t think ai when we see it all serious chess players practice against chess programs so do beginning go players and after alphago’s success practicing against a computer will certainly extend to experts these are artificial intelligences that have already broken off and become parts of our world in doing so ai morphed into ia intelligence augmentation autonomous technology that trumped human abilities became assistivewill we ever be able to point to something and say “yes that’s artificial intelligence” yes certainly we can do that now what’s more important is that we will inevitably be surrounded by ai bathed in it even before we know it we take plumbing for granted we take electricity for granted our children take streaming music for granted we will take ai for granted even as it becomes a larger

share that information with third parties for advertising analyticsby ben dickson — in artificial intelligencethere’s currently a shortage of over seven million physicians nurses and other health workers worldwide and the gap is widening doctors are stretched thin — especially in underserved areas — to respond to the growing needs of the populationmeanwhile training physicians and health workers is historically an arduous process that requires years of education and experienceyou should definitely be therefortunately artificial intelligence can help the healthcare sector to overcome present and future challenges here’s how ai algorithms and software are improving the quality and availability of healthcare servicesone of the most basic yet efficient use cases of artificial intelligence is to optimize the clinical process traditionally when patients feel ill they go to the doctor who checks their vital signs asks questions and gives a prescription now ai assistants can cover a large part of clinical and outpatient services freeing up doctors’ time to attend to more critical casesyourmd is an aipowered mobile app that provides basic healthcare the chatbot asks users about their symptoms and provides easytounderstand information about their medical conditions the platform has a vast network of information that links symptoms to causesthe assistant uses natural language processing and generation to provide a rich and fluid experience and machine learning algorithms to create a complex map of the user’s condition and provide a personalized experienceyourmd suggests steps and measures to remedy the illness including warning users when they need to see a doctoruk’s national health service nhs has approved the information yourmd provides this means as opposed to selfdiagnosis users don’t have to worry about the authenticity and reliability of the guidance they getother health assistants such as ada integrate their technology with amazon alexa to improve the user experience ada becomes smarter as it gets familiar with the user’s medical history aside from generating a detailed symptom assessment report ada also provides the option to contact a real doctorbabylon health another intelligent health companion complements its assistance by following up with users on past symptoms and in case the need arises setting up live video consultation with a general practitionerhealth assistants save patients a trip to the doctor for more trivial diseases also in areas where doctors and clinics are in short supply it can save patients hours of waiting in linethe treatment and prevention of rare and dangerous diseases often depends on detecting the symptoms at the right time in many cases early diagnosis can result in complete cure conversely a late or wrong diagnosis can have damaging or potentially fatal results human skills and experience are limited and hardtoearn when it comes to examining images and samples and making reliable decisionsai algorithms can quickly ingest millions of samples in short order and glean useful patterns and unlike humans they don’t lose their edge when they grow old several institutions and firms are investing on this scheme in developing healthcare solutionsresearchers at stanford university have created an ai algorithm that can identify skin cancer they trained their deep learning algorithm with 130000 images of moles rashes and lesions according to results its efficiency in diagnosing skin cancer rivals that of professional doctors the researchers hope to make it available through a mobile app some time in the future this can be an opportunity to provide inexpensive screening to anyone with smartphonedeepmind a googleowned ai company is using machine learning to fight blindness in cooperation with nhs researchers at the firm are training a deep learning algorithm with a million anonymous eye scans this will help spot eye conditions such as wet agerelated macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy at early stages according to the experts in some cases they might eventually be able to prevent 98 percent of most severe visual lossmorpheo is an ai platform that helps in the diagnosis of sleep disorders the traditional process of analyzing sleep patterns is complicated and time consuming with the help of machine learning algorithms morpheo is assisting doctors by automating the identification of sleep patterns the creators believe this will help in creating predictive and preventive treatmentsfor some diseases identifying the right treatment path and adapting it to changes overcoming patient health is critical and challengingibm is having its own foray at fighting cancer with ai and its watson for oncology platform is getting ready for production the platform will be used in a florida community hospital to help treat cancer patients watson is especially adept at analyzing both structured and unstructured datait ingests reams of clinical trial data and medical journal entries then finds patterns and presents cancer care teams with a list of effective therapies and treatment optionsexperts at university of north carolina school of medicine tested watson with one thousand cancer cases the platform gave the same recommendations as professional oncologists in 99 percent of the casesthis can prove crucial to smaller hospitals and medical centers that are lacking in human expertise and technical resourcesother firms are using artificial intelligence to take small yet crucial steps in the treatment of illnesses one example is aicure a mobile app that uses ai and image analysis to control patient adherence to prescriptions this includes making sure patients take their medication on time and perform other tasks ordained by their doctor this can be useful for people with serious medical conditions and patients who might go against their doctor’s prescriptionsartificial intelligence has challenges to overcome before it gains full traction in many fields and healthcare is no exception especially where privacy is concerned last year deepmind ran afoul of uk authorities and privacy groups over its data sharing deal with the nhs medical information is sensitive and institutions that handle it need to mind their collection storage and sharing policiessome firms are considering blockchain the distributed ledger that supports bitcoin and ethereum as a solution morpheo for instance uses blockchain to ensure transparency and privacy of patient data on its platformanother openended question is how artificial intelligence will affect jobs in the healthcare sector at the current stage it’s a given that caring for humans is the job of humans for the moment no algorithm is able to emulate both the social and professional functions of a doctor or nurse in fact robots are not replacing but enhancing human efforts to improve the overall quality and availability of health serviceswill the

book yet you’d be surprised how often you use it daily as the technology continues to improve ai will become even more common with more widespread utilization among diverse industries to start with let’s begin with the basic definition of artificial intelligence ai and what it includesseeking alpha gives a very apt description of the same in their article at a basic level artificial intelligence is the concept of machines accomplishing tasks which have historically required human intelligence ai can be broken down into two distinct fieldsapplied ai machines designed to complete very specifics tasks like navigating a vehicle trading stocks or playing chess – as ibm’s deep blue demonstrated in 1996 when it defeated chess grand master gerry kasparovgeneral ai machines designed to complete any task which would normally require human intervention the broad nature of general ai requires machines to “learn” as they encounter new tasks or situations this need for a learned approach is what gave rise to modern machine learning”let’s take a look at some of the most powerful artificial intelligence use cases across various industry verticals that are in use today with an eye towards revealing the competitive advantage of aiacross industries that have been gold mines for ai investments automated threat intelligence automated customer services agent and fraud detection are the biggestas per jessica goepfert program director customer insights and analysis at idc “nearterm opportunities for cognitive systems are in industries such as banking securities and investments and manufacturing…in these segments we find a wealth of unstructured data a desire to harness insights from this information and an openness to innovative technologies”fintech has witnessed a staggering growth in investments world over with the growth of over 10 to a whopping 232 billion us and china leading the market this boost is powered by growing capabilities of ai and machine learning as ai has already achieved much in retail healthcare trading etc – it is safe to say that ai will achieve great things in financea study by oxford university state that robots will replace approximately 47 of us jobs in the next 1020 years the goal however is not to put american workers out of work but about the improved efficiency that having a robot doing clinical work brings in therefore a skilled employee can focus on a more important taskby eliminating monotonous tasks that take way too much time from an employee’s day organizations can better use their employee’s time and skills for more important tasks along with giving employees the opportunity to work on more important tasks artificial intelligence also offers elimination of error in tasks which is often associated with manual and repetitive taskspoor customer service seems to be one of the main complains by customers regardless of the industry ironically customers seem to be frustrated with not being able to talk to a human and stuck with an automated systemmachine learning application though has the ability to learn an individual user’s requirements by examining their account activity and assisting the customer with a better product selection offered by bfsi companiessophisticated language parsing enables today’s ai chatbots and virtual agents to provide more realistic texttovoice systems that provide realvalue making the phone chat systems customer friendly this provides companies a costefficient solution for customer service issueswells fargo the american international american international banking and financial company uses a chatbot for assisting its customers in doing small tasks like taking their account information and helping them reset their passwords“ai technology allows us to take an experience that would have required our customers to navigate through several pages on our website and turn it into a simple conversation in a chat environment that’s a huge timesaving convenience for busy customers who are already frequent users of messenger” commented steve ellis head of wells fargo’s innovation groupother than customer engagement chatbots are also used by investment service companies as stock market assistants to enable users to stay on top of the market with realtime information on stock prices and other insights like news of diverse candidate companies to assist them in investment decisionsfor eg intelegain powered moneypotin a virtual stock simulation platform is test driving a cognitive intelligence bot using microsoft bot framework to provide realtime assistant services to help investors with investment options in the equity marketsmany financial institutions are investing in new technologies like ai and big data to improve security standards since financial institutions handle sensitive information and investments of thousands of people security is always a prioritywith more cyberattacks happening than ever upgraded banking cybersecurity software will be critical in the coming year in order to protect customers banks from hackersin a similar manner fraud detection is also on ai agenda perpetrators of fraud are smart and produce paper trails that look legitimate in the eyes of a human ai however can assist in detecting something that humans cannot through ai financial entities can detect suspicious entities investigate them thus potentially preventing thousands of expensive fraudulent transactions copycats are common in frauds this is where machine learning can offer a powerful means of preventing fraudulent activities in the futurejpmorgan chase introduced a contract intelligence coin platform developed to “analyze legal documents and extract important data points and clauses” manual reviews of 12000 annual commercial credit agreements which used to take near 360000 hours now take only secondsthe company also implemented emerging opportunities engine in 2015 which uses automated analysis in order to assist in “identifying clients best positioned for followon equity offerings”trading algorithms are already used successfully in world’s markets recognizing the staggering speed with which computer systems have transformed stock trading even though automation rules the trading world the most complex algorithms use basic ai reasoningmachine learning is poised to change the tradition by putting emphasis on making the decision more harddata based and lesser grounded on trading theorieswhile humans will always play a role in regulation and for making the final decisions more and more financial transactions are making their way to computer systems plus given the competitive nature of this field investment in ai and machine learning will be one of the most defining aspects of the field luckily these technologies have the potential to stabilize and not disrupt the financial industry therefore resulting in better job stability even reducing the probability of market crashesaidyia limited was founded in hong kong in october 2011 built to “deploy advanced artificial intelligence technology to identify patterns and predict price movements in financial markets”while computers are excellent at collecting storing data the costefficient storage equals to financial organizations storing more than ever before making sense of this information however is difficult as humans cannot rationalize big data setsai especially when assisted by a machine learning is adept at detecting small signals within large data sets this data can be crucial in fields that are competitive as the finance industryukbased arria has developed an nlg software natural language generation that is being utilized across a range of industries to “humanize” and simplify the process of analyzing dataheavy reportsarria’s cto robert dale states “by emulating human behavior in software you get technology that can carry out tasks that are more than just straightforward number crunching with the machine exhibiting real intelligence…but you get all the benefits of this being done by software it’s incredibly fast it’s incredibly consistent and it doesn’t need to sleep or take vacations so it’s available 247”ai is going to have a significant influence on data science use cases in banking same as it is going to affect finance healthcare and pharmaceuticals as most organizations have recognized the importance of big data there is an unmet need for data scientists – an issue that ai can sort out one of the best application of ai as of now is to perform the menial work of data analysis that may be number crunching finding flaws in investment strategies or a chatbot answering customer’s queries – it is the economic solution to make everything run smoother faster and at a lower costthe market size of ai software is expected to reach up to 36 million by 2025 the opportunities this presents have caused retailers to pay attention to ai thus more and more retailers big and small are applying ai tools in new ways across the entire product and service cycle right from the assembling stage to the postsale customer service interactions as ai evolves further the customer experience will only get better and so will improved outcomes through sales and customer experiences some of the examples of creative ai applications in different areas of retail are envisioned below“personalization at scale is the holy grail…by adding elements of personality insights or sentiment touchpoints like email and web personalization can become contextually aware and can build on previous customer interactions” says corinne sklar chief marketing officer at ibm consultancy bluewolfretailers are doing everything in their capacity to provide a happy shopping experience to customers this includes constantly improving on personalization however it all boils down to enhancing the overall customer experiencekaren katz president ceo of neiman marcus group rightly puts this in perspective“great customer experience in the future will come from blending technology with a more personalized touch i think the people that can combine technologypowered personalization with a human will be the winners”north face the outdoor clothing company adopted ibm watson cognitive technology in order to help customers determine what jacket may be the best option for them it bases its answers on gender preference location month activity etc for eg – hiking in canada in december will yield different results than commuting in traveling in ireland in februaryanother ai application that is finding increasing popularity is the conversational assistant whether it is through smart speakers email messaging platforms – marketers are leveraging new tools to have conversations with customers to build stronger relationships with customers brands are delivering hyperpersonalized content and product recommendation through virtual assistants chatbots etcfurthermore applications like chatbot and virtual assistants provide “relevance” ie offer the right message to the relevant customer at the right time – a key part of building sales customer relationships all the while minimizing marketing wastechris mccann ceo president of 1800flowerscom one of the first retailers to launch an alexa skill comments about possibilities ai could bring in retail “with voice as the main interface emerging i think it will bring us back to the retail experience of our first flower shop where we delivered a true 1to1 relationship voice enables us to have a 1to1 relationship with customers on a massive scale”ll bean makes use of a chatbot which asks visitors if they would like to login into their loyalty account this chatbot which is “loyalty aware” links to the customer’s loyalty points and crm data to personalize customer’s choices the interactions between the bot and user are also recorded and saved back to the crm systemmany retailers are using video analytics to improve customer service security and compliance with employee procedures retailers need a system where they can examine customer behavior in ‘bricknmortar’ stores just like they use behavior tracking for online purchasesartificial intelligence can help retailers understand inperson shoppers data generated by retail observation can determine the customers’ product’s exposure level engagement their navigational route through the store this information can help retailers improve store layout in order to influence maximum exposure and increase the customer’s visit timesephora the french cosmetics brand with retail stores of beauty products adopted video analytics technology that examined the digital video stream from the store cameras and counted the people visiting the store insights are gained from various reports statistics footfalls periodic trends peaks and valleys help them prompt towards more successful strategiesbrands are utilizing image recognition to understand customers’ preferences and recommend products that suit them the most for eg pinterest uses image recognition technology to look at an image and recommend similar content in the context of retail this capability enables brands to provide the customers’ access to their own digital “personal shopper”“the use of artificial intelligence ai and particularly visual recognition will continue momentum in opening up new and exciting sales opportunities for retailers for example visual search for products will grow particularly via mobile and the monetization of ecommerce imagery via automated product tagging will bring new revenue streams in the future” – alex vaidya ceo cofounder storystreamikea uses image recognition technology to enable customers to take photos of images in the company catalog to retrieve useful information about the specific productswap patterns colors and even see how the final product would look like in homeswhile the uptake of ai in the retail sector looks promising it is noted that applications that have the highest likelihood of adoption are those that have the most possibility of a direct return on investment most companies therefore are going to be very critical safe and bottomline focused when it comes ai adoption future ai innovations will be dictated by retail ai use cases that have already proven to be most effective overall ai involvement in the retail sector for a long term seems inevitable consideration must be given to the impact of ai on the business to make sure that employees and customers are all on board thus to successfully implement ai a balance must be maintained in between greater automation and an equal emphasis on skill development for employees and people engagement for customersai can redesign and improve healthcare in multiple ways for eg it can assist medical professionals in designing treatment plans and finding the most suitable treatment method that is the best for the particular patient it can help in carrying out tasks that are monotonous so that physicians can concentrate on their core jobsthere are already few great examples of ai in healthcare which show great potential mining medical records are one of those evident applications of ai in healthcaredata management is one of foremost potentialshowing ai application in healthcare the first step towards revolutionizing the existing healthcare systems is to collect it store it normalize it and trace its lineage it contains developing a natural language processing technology to automatically extract data from narrative medical recordsgoogle deepmind health is used to mine medical records in order to offer better and faster health services it is able to process hundreds of thousands of medical information within a matter of minutes although machine learning and dataharvesting are at its initial stage at the moment google in coordination with moorfields eye hospital nhs foundation trust is striving to improve eye treatmentai can help in carrying out repetitive tasks which take away medical professional’s time from their core jobs tasks such as xray scans ct scans analyzing tests and data entry etc can be done faster and more accurately by robots radiology and cardiology are two such disciplines where the amount of data for analyzing can be timeconsuming and overwhelming and timeexhaustingibm medical sieve is an ambitious longterm exploratory project which plans to build the nextgeneration “cognitive assistant” which is capable of analytics and reasoning with a vast range of clinical knowledge medical sieve can help in making the clinical decision regarding cardiology and radiology – a “cognitive health assistant” in other terms it is able to analyze the radiology images to detect problems reliably and speedilyai chatbots use natural language processing to understand the user’s demands followed by knowledge management to offer an answer further it uses deep learning to improve its response to each interaction sentiment analysis identifies the user’s issue and then transfers them to a human in the context of healthcare chatbots can fulfill various objectives like diagnosing the patient using the information given on symptomsyourmd – this chatbot uses artificial intelligence technology to guide the user with most relevant information for better health and life it provides the most accurate and simplest to understand medical informationnuance communications virtual assistant platform enables conversational dialogue and prebuilt capabilities that automate clinical workflows the healthcare virtual assistant employs voice recognition ehr integrations and strategic health it relationships voice biometrics texttospeech and prototype smart speaker customized for a secure platformai systems have been designed to analyze data reports and notes from a patient’s file clinical expertise and external research in order to assist in selecting the correct individually customized treatment pathibm watson provides clinicians evidencebased treatment options watson for oncology has an advanced ability to analyze the meaning and context of structured and unstructured data in clinical notes and reports that may be critical to selecting a treatment pathway the program ultimately identifies most potential treatment plans for a patient integrating notes on patient’s life research and clinical expertisedevelopment of pharmaceuticals via clinical trials can take more than a decade and cost a lot therefore making the process speedier and cheaper is one of the main objectives ai startups are aiming foratomwise amongst the recent ebola scare an ai powered program for scanning existing medicines that could be redesigned to fight diseases was utilized the technology found two drugs that may significantly decrease ebola infectivity this analysis which would have otherwise taken monthsyears was completed within 24 hours this efficiency in drug creation has the potential to save thousands of liveseven with big advancements of ai application in healthcare over the recent years it is unlikely that technology will replace the diagnostic role of physicians at least in the near future ai however is now sophisticated enough to take over the tedious repetitive tasks that used take up the productive hours of a physician the potential ai holds in healthcare is endless with professionals exploring the application of ai in areas like insurance verification skin cancer diagnosis medical record data analysis etc we are just beginning to realize the true depth of healthtech innovation that can be unlocked with ai technologyai essentially processes a huge amount of data and then puts it to use currently there is so much data involved in logistics chain that it is difficult to comprehend it all without the assistance of ai with the application of algorithms the processor is able to examine and store the data and then act respond and intervene accordinglyai also has the capability of analyzing past data and learn from it to enable businesses with better recommendations using predictive analyticsone of the possibilities that ai can realize in logistics is that of increased automation for eg aipowered robots used to automatically restock empty warehouse but also predict when they will run low even if this might be way off for most one advantage of all the data analysis is the realtime information gained as well as complete visibility of warehouse stockin fact carousel the leading provider of personalized logistics predicts that one of the biggest growth areas where the artificial technology will make noteworthy difference to the bottom line is the intelligent forecast systems and in providing valueadded services more easily at a costefficient rateanticipatory logistics are grounded on predictive algorithms running on big data this permits logistics professionals to improve efficiency and quality by estimating demand in advance before the customer places an orderthe foremost influencer for anticipatory logistics is the customer’s lack of patience with long delivery times customers always want their online shopping experience to be matched with the convenience of fast deliveryin this area anticipatory logistics benefits all parties involved in the supply line – by anticipating demand permitting businesses to spike up their resources before the demand shoots upfor eg ai predicting that consumer demand for the latest mobile device model is going to rise – the manufacturer then will increase the production of that particular model accordingly this will in turn inform the trucking companies in advance of how much transportation capability is needed to deliver all the mobile devices and when date the retailer will know to order adequate stock – to increase advertising efforts and display space on the store shelves and in general prepare for a boom in online shoppinganticipatory logistics also serve well on the supply chain risk management front ai tools predict maintenance needs and probable risks quite similar to transportationdisruption management predictions manufacturing and transportation industries utilize ai technology to vehicle and factory maintenance in such a case predictive maintenance is based on the sensor data gathered from smart machines and vehiclesfor eg konux a munichbased iiot company – integrates smart sensor systems with aibased analytics in order to monitor infrastructure and other assets’ condition and thus enable predictive maintenance one of their solutions includes switch monitoring which assists rail operators in monitoring and examination of switch health the system helps observe the progressing mechanical wear of switches and detect anomalies in time this prevents railroad switch errors“machine learning uses massive computing power to recognize patterns in data that humans could never see and then learns from every new piece of data it receives to get smarter and more accurate in real time” says joccommachine learning ml or rather selflearning is a very familiar concept in industries like digital pattern detection ediscovery and sensor data analytics even if the logistics industries have been particularly slow in the uptake of machine learning other logistics intuitive companies are adopting selflearning systemsmachine learning leverages data across multiple systems and data sets in the context of logistics – the system combines all the data in the carrier network with outside data sources like gps systems historical pricing performance and federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa to assist shippers more accurately estimate demand examine trends in supply chains track daily patterns within lanes and monitor seasonal calendarspopular usage of ml and logistics are decoding ineligible handwritten text often found on the envelopes in fact post offices are already making use of these selfserving learning logistics as are the big shipping companies like fedex and upsa newer selflearning system that has been introduced is that of ‘intelligent warehouse management system’ like the panasonic iws the company introduces the intelligent warehouse system panasonic iws as “a complete solution which includes surveillance cameras data network video recording tracking software and your existing xray scanning technology”these systems detect the trends and incidents examine the data and connect the insights gained to specific entities like orders or customers and launch prepack instructionsnlp is a form of machine learning which is dramatically improving the efficiency of supply chains by speeding up the data entry process and autopopulating form fieldsnlp integration with transportation management system tms and email text chat and voice communication the nlp systems observe and learn from these exchanges after enough data feed the system recognizes the behavior of particular users and begins to anticipate the users’ need by autopopulating the bill of lading shipping orders and other transactions saving the shipper’s timechatbots in logistics can provide better customer engagement for eg rather than going to the website of the logistics service provider to find the details of their consignment and feed the specific code a complex combo of numbers and alphabets all the customer will need to do need to do is open a simple chat window for the solutionnatural disasters union strikes highway closures etc there are many incidences that can disrupt shipping schedules this can cause a ripple effect and affect the entire supply chain thus disruption management can avoid or at least alleviate disruptions by feeding data from the union activities national weather service and transportation board law enforcement etcml allows the users to train the ai engine with diverse contingency plans allowing it to suggest possible solutions for likely disruption amadeus provides a disruption management solution which manages passenger reaccommodation for one or multiple flightsnamed as amadeus passenger recovery once the scheduled event is received it “proposes an optimal passenger recovery plan rebooks services reissues tickets and emds transfers bags and checks passengers onto their new flight this process takes into account realtime flight availability within the airline’s network and beyond airline policies and passenger prioritization”machines learning models price predictions which is quite similar to automated stock trading software the system takes account of historical pricing data for a variety of routes goods and delivery schedules then it crossreferences them with the traffic weather and then estimates the fairest priceai analytics can track individual suppliers and report what type of cargo the transportation company carries and how much they charge the broker filters the results in order to crossreference the supplier types for eg a moving company who deal with dangerous materials crossreferences with cargo security accident reports and priceswhile the broker may maintain personal relationships with suppliers the ai tool enables the organization to smartly manage the supplier inventory rather than relying completely on the relationships or past historyai has aroused interest not only because of its ability to increase efficiency and service customers at a lower cost but also due to its potential to create more agile business models – that are scalable and flexible to the continuously changing market needs up until now logistic professionals had to rely on predictions which were sometimes outdated on inventory levels and static sales information rather than live data issues like these have been solved by ai which enables professionals to get the precise information of what is going on – thus discontinuing the dependency on guesstimations ai offers great possibilities for efficiencies while customers too can enjoy fast delivery reliable stock information timesaving and overall a great user experience with aipowered logistics and supply chain managementone of the most discussed technologies that have made a huge impact on finance industry as well as payment industry is artificial intelligence it can safely be said that it is capturing the interest of companies worldwidefor eg tesla facebook amazon apple and google all have already started investing actively in ai technology ai covers a wide spectrum of technologies that work in payment services“artificial intelligence is likely to transform many industries in the next decade including payments” predicts michelle evans global head of digital consumer research at euromonitor international so let’s see how if ai is making his predictions come truemachine learning ml is especially important now than ever in fraud detection as there is a significant shift to ecommerce and other remote “cards not present” transactions where fast approval is needed yet the customer’s physical card is not available for additional verificationstudies point out that such remote channels are primarily responsible for increased levels of fraud at us merchants – especially amongst larger companiesplus due to the significant change in immediate payment systems which correspond to requiring faster identification of potentially fraudulent transactions the importance of fraud detection is driven up using the machine learning’s algorithm to derive insights into which correlation of variable lead to a fraudulent paymentthe systems use rulebased logic to block the transactions that have the highest probability of being a fraud albeit professional conmen are fast at detecting when their payments are being blocked and switch to a new merchant to continue their scheme combining the forces of ml and ai historical data can be used to identify patterns associated with fraud and make quick adjustments to their algorithm’s and rulebased logic without human interferencecanadian travel agency redtagca uses distil networks which weeds out the bad bots that are fraudulently reserving a block of seats on a flight to cause the price of the remaining seats to rise dramaticallyanother example is that of the 3d secure newest version which is playing a key role in new ecommerce security product powered by ai it is an additional security layer within its ecommerce fraud prevention platform which uses ml and ai to flag down the riskiest transactions that should be challenged in order to protect merchants from chargebacks and fraudml and ai can be used to optimize payments by dealing with one of the biggest issues regarding processing cards ie authorization ratesnotwithstanding the rules and frequent compliance releases from schemes like mastercard and visa getting a payment authorized – is more difficult than it seems the merchants send their transactions to psps who send it to the acquirers who create the complete message to send it to the schemes and then they pass it the issuerthere is 1 in 5 chances that the payment gets refused it can show anything from ‘expired’ to “not honored’ as a reason for the declinethe situation remains that by using ml and ai merchants psps are able to learn from the submitted payments and estimate the success rate depending upon the category of card type transaction issuers merchant’s country and other parameters therefore by optimizing the route ie the transaction to the acquirer with the highest probability of success merchantspsp can increase their authorization rate3d secure 20 improves the authentication possibilities that enable merchants to move closer to frictionless checkout experiences for their customers with improved security and new intelligent risk based possibilitiesanother area of payment services where ai is utilized is for marketing which gets quite an attention but is not as developed as one might think many payment service providers have used ai to make predictions grounded on customer’s behavior using them to push certain products services that will help customers manage their financescrosscues uses machine learning and ai to enable their clients to understand anticipate and engage their customers equipped with data they use their neural network which is a computer system modeled off the human brain which “makes a psychographic profile of a customer advising the financial institution about what a specific customer or demographic likes and dislikes”while there’s still a long way to go before we let aibased tools and algorithms control our financial systems the fintech sector is starting to use the technologies in diverse and creative ways the crossover between ai and fintech comes at a stage where ai is creating disruptive technology for the consumer payments and digital transactions are key areas for successful integration of ai services to improve customer experience fortunately for customers major industry players in the payment industry like paypal amazon mastercard and google have their eye on ai their involvement in the revolutionary change may have a positive butterfly effect throughout the industry“with advancing adoption of ai manufacturers can leave the mundane and routine tasks to automation and free themselves up to pursue new ideas and new ways of thing making – that’s beyond the realm of machines” – infosysit is through manufacturing that we are able to transform a few pixels on display into tangible physical objects by bringing ai into the mix it is possible to deliver digital transformation to the physical world ai is furthermore well suited to addressing challenges that the manufacturing industry faces today issues like inflexible production line design variable quality and yield rising production costs inability to manage capacity can be solved with ai capabilitywith the assistance of automated quality control predictive maintenance adaptive manufacturing and more ai can develop solutions around controlling and automating visual inspection automated issue identification calibration and tuning for large scale manufacturersai can shorten design cycles optimize utilization of energy and materials remove supplychain bottlenecks improve quality control and production yields etcadaptive manufacturing compliantly produces develops and delivers demanddriven products while optimally leveraging existing resources in order for adaptive manufacturing to happen though the manufacturers must seamlessly transmit knowledge for defining scheduling and producing products in between their enterprise systems and shopfloor systemsrethink robotics a us based company that develops robots for production and research environments advocated “cobot” model in this model the humans and robots work cooperatively to produce the best results and efficiency even though industrial robots performed tedious tasks on assembly lines and heavy lifting they are generally designed with the purpose of doing single tasks and require hours to reprogram these smart collaborative robots are able to learn a multitude of tasks from demonstrations – just like human workers dopredictive analytics as its name suggests predicts the future based on the functions of the past it can calculate when maintenance is needed for cars devices trucks and drilling machines and then it can also schedule repairs and upkeep before a severe failure happenssiemens launched mindsphere in 2016 which it describes as “a smart cloud for industry – allows machine manufacturers to monitor machine fleets for service purposes throughout the world” by the end of 2016 they had also integrated ibm’s watson analytics into the tools offered by their servicethe company not unlike ge aims to monitor record and analyze everything in manufacturing from the design to delivery in order to figure out the problems and solutions that people may not even be aware of one of the many successes siemens has enjoyed with ai is the improved specific gas turbines’ emissions which has improved to a level than any human was capable of“even after experts had done their best to optimize the turbine’s nitrous oxide emissions…our ai system was able to reduce emissions by an additional ten to fifteen percent” commented norbert gaus head of research in digitalization and automation at siemens corporate technologysiemens latest gas turbines have over 500 sensors that continuously temperature pressure stress and other variables all this information is fed to their neural networkbased ai siemens claims their system is learning how to continuously adjust fuel valves to create the optimal conditions for combustion based on specific weather conditions and the current state of the equipment more combustion results in few unwanted byproductsunderestimating or overestimating consumer demand can result in lost revenues either in the form of lost sales or stagnant inventory rather than running reactively connected consumer apps and iot with industrial iot can be depended upon for real time demand visibility with the rise of smart home devices like google home and amazon echo the consumer trends and behavioral data can inform downstream supply chain and manufacturing activitieseven if there is no whole endtoend network right now at least in operation supply chain optimization organizations like elemica already combine the business processes like order management procurement transportation sourcing and inventory management in a single convenient platformanother eg is that of amazon which controls consumer touchpoint like the echo manufacturing warehouses fulfillment centers – are actively investing in order to the close the feedback loop for ondemand productiona speedier feedback loop empowers the factories to overcome low yields percentage of units that pass the quality control unplanned downtimes low productivity etcnick pinkston founder of plathora explains “issues with low yield are most acute around high complexity products — like a laptop where there are a ton of various systems that need to come together perfectly for the product to work”he furthers that productivity is not given priority against yield the faster the manufacturer pushes the process more likely he is to make mistakes and produce low quality output “better monitoring and adaptive control can allow you to increase the productivity of a single machine and likewise better overall system monitoring and planning can allow the overall system to produce more product on the same numbers of machines” he saysinstrumentalai leverages cameras powered by computer vision algorithms to triage defects in the products immediately rather than relying on humans and detect the root cause of failure doing anomaly detection on hundreds or thousands of units in seconds rather than hours enables manufacturers to identify and resolve production failures before expensive postponements heap upthe manufacturing industry is already technically advanced using automation robotics for years that is why unlike other fields where ai deployment can cause disruption the shortterm utilization of ai in manufacturing is more likely to look like evolution rather than a revolution while faster training time improved ontime deliveries a decrease in equipment failures seem small but when considered together their potential is significantmeanwhile in longterm the total digital integration and improved automation of the whole production and design process can possibly open up a range of interesting possibilities customizations are rare and expensive meanwhile massproduced goods are the longstanding model in manufacturing since presently the redesigning cost of the factory line for new products is often excessivealthough customers are willing to settle for the massproduced goods as they are cheaper if the technology for customization is cheap enough it can create a real shift in many markets so imagine instead of shoes coming in just a dozens of sizes they will come in an infinite number of sizes each order customized as per unique fitting and shipped just as quicklyone of the trendiest topics in the legal field right now is a technology with the capability of simulating human intelligence and decision making and making it faster 10 times ie the artificial intelligence ai the growing interest of ai in law is said to be slowly revolutionizing the profession and thus closing in on legal researchers paralegals and litigators etcai companies are continuing to find new ways in which ai can be applied to manage the laborious tasks in different industries for better accuracy and speed in the legal sector the technology providers are trying to streamline work processes breaking down ai’s current legal applications we come to three main categories in which ai is applied in the legal industry – ie research analytics and automating creative processes“due diligence is an investigation of a business or person prior to signing a contract or an act with a certain standard of care it can be a legal obligation but the term will more commonly apply to voluntary investigations” explains google snippetit is one of the basic tasks that lawyers do on the behalf of their clients which includes confirmation of facts and figures and thoroughly examining a legal situation the due diligence process is needed for intelligently advising clients on what their options are what action they should take etcwhile a comprehensive due diligence can have a positive effect on longterm shareholder returns the process can be timeconsuming and expensive lawyers need to conduct an allinclusive investigation for meaningful results plus lawyers are probable to make errors while performing spot checksfor eg leverton a branch of the german institute for artificial intelligence also utilizes ai technology for extraction of relevant information management of documents and for compiling leases in real estate transactions this cloudbased tool can perform the reading of contracts at the high speeds in 20 different languagesanother example of an ai technology for research purposes is ross intelligence software which helps in legal research the number of links cases and information that is present in the research can overwhelm lawyers especially if they have limited time on their hands lawyers therefore can take advantage of the natural language search capability that ross intelligence software is equipped with and ask questions receive information like for suggested readings secondary resources and related case lawsautomated contract analysis is already used by large companies as well as by an online dispute resolution system that can assist in settling many cases in a more costefficient manner compared to in the courtamiqus chief executive callum murray explains “the issue with that at the moment is access to the volume dataset” with an enormous amount of data currently behind paywalls “the ministry of justice is looking at openly publishing some court information” he adds “it’s going to take some time to change that but once that changes it’s really going to open the floodgates to an open innovation approach”many studies indicate that knowledge work automation will be the biggest disruptors in the global economy many law firms have taken advantage of this technology by automating the process of document drafting using a software like the perfect ndaneota logic system is one such law firm using the automation software perfect nda to shorten the nondisclosure agreement nda process via providing templates chosen by ai as per user’s scenario the user answers the questions through which a prefilled template is generatedplus the software also has features like document filing and integrated esignatures in order to streamline associated manual processes involved in nda draftingway back in 2004 a group of professors from washington university had tested their algorithm’s accuracy in forecasting supreme court’s decisions on a total 628 argued cases in 2002 a comparison in between their algorithms’ result versus an expert team’s findings was drawn the statistical model by the professors proved to be better at forecasting with predicting 75 of outcomes correctly compared to the 59 accuracy of expert’s teamfor eg premonition is litigation database which claims that it can predict a lawyer’s success by analyzing the lawyer’s winning rate case duration and type plus his pairing with a judge at an accuracy rate of 307 average case outcome the company says that the product can assist in looking at different cases and the duration they will take for each attorney as wellit must be remembered however like any other analytics platform that ai tools dealing with predictive technology need an enormous amount of data in the form of case documents to fully function“the model itself is exceptionally complicated it uses a total of about 95 variables with very precise weights with almost precise values up to four or five decimal places and each justice’s vote is predicted by creating about 4000 randomized decision trees” says vox of premonitionone of the biggest areas where lawyer’s expertise is needed is while securing trademarks copyrights and patents the entire intellectual property application process though can be exhaustive and arduous traditional trademark and patent search comprise of looking into hundreds if not thousands of results through manual research this is time consuming meanwhile patent applications are timesensitive“patent applications in the us must be filed within 1 year of a public disclosure or an offer for sale of the invention or the invention is barred from obtaining patent protection” explains scherrer an intellectual property law firmfor eg turbopatent’s smartshell enables paralegals in improving efficiency by automating document reviews drafting formatting and detecting problems on patent applications it uses ai and nlp natural language processing to aid in creating legal claims according to turbopatent two paralegals from the pacific patent group used smartshell to do bibliographic research examiner remarks review document retrieval and rejection issues discovery they were able to be up to 800 more productive in their tasks with only 15th of the time in comparison to their manual methods to perform the same taskselectronic billing now delivers legal billing securely from law firms and other vendors directly to the desktops of inhouse counselproviding an alternative to paper based invoicing – it offers “average savings of more than 22 in annual outside legal spending from improved bill review and 26 from budget tracking” according to the 10th edition of the annual accserengeti survey of acc members other than savings it also reduces disputes on line items proffers accurate client adjustments and accurate tracking and reporting probablythere are others though that have criticized the technology like mark herrman a leading international law firm partner writes in his article “automated systems that unthinkingly cut bills can lead to unintended consequences for example some corporate clients refuse to pay for more than ten hours of a single lawyer’s time billed in one day unless the lawyer is physically at a trial site”while the software needs to be evaluated for possible adjustments there are a few that have been using it successfullyfor eg smokeball’s cloudbased legal practice management tool claims to “automatically records your law firms time and activities” one of the major features of this tool is its ability to track all activities – which includes emails only which are valid for billing according to its website it has automated 636300 forms managed 105 million documents and 17 million emailsai’s role in law and the legal profession is a peculiar situation which is a bit of a catch 22 since enhancing improving efficiency seems to be the most acknowledged benefit of ai tools the documents processing and detecting errors is sped upthis seems to be ironic since the legal market has long since depended on “billable hours” therefore it would be unlikely for lawyers to take less time in completing a task document for this reason only eliminating menial time exhausting work will not likely be strong enough reason to drive ai adoptionhowever what is more likely to drive up ai adoption is the legal firms which will be more efficient and thus costefficient as a result of implementing ai offering low cost service to their clients thus the remaining firms which do not have ai capability will discover themselves to be overpriced in the competitionnevertheless ai is making its way in the legal market– it will most likely backup rather than displace legal professionals and it will draw it more into the legal service

hassabis founded a company to build the world’s most powerful ai then google bought him out hal hodson asks who is in chargedemis hassabis founded a company to build the world’s most powerful ai then google bought him out hal hodson asks who is in chargeone afternoon in august 2010 in a conference hall perched on the edge of san francisco bay a 34yearold londoner called demis hassabis took to the stage walking to the podium with the deliberate gait of a man trying to control his nerves he pursed his lips into a brief smile and began to speak “so today i’m going to be talking about different approaches to building…” he stalled as though just realising that he was stating his momentous ambition out loud and then he said it “agi”agi stands for artificial general intelligence a hypothetical computer program that can perform intellectual tasks as well as or better than a human agi will be able to complete discrete tasks such as recognising photos or translating languages which are the singleminded focus of the multitude of artificial intelligences ais that inhabit our phones and computers but it will also add subtract play chess and speak french it will also understand physics papers compose novels devise investment strategies and make delightful conversation with strangers it will monitor nuclear reactions manage electricity grids and traffic flow and effortlessly succeed at everything else agi will make today’s most advanced ais look like pocket calculatorsthe only intelligence that can currently attempt all these tasks is the kind that humans are endowed with but human intelligence is limited by the size of the skull that houses the brain its power is restricted by the puny amount of energy that the body is able to provide because agi will run on computers it will suffer none of these constraints its intelligence will be limited only by the number of processors available agi may start by monitoring nuclear reactions but soon enough it will discover new sources of energy by digesting more physics papers in a second than a human could in a thousand lifetimes humanlevel intelligence coupled with the speed and scalability of computers will make problems that currently appear insoluble disappear hassabis told the observer a british newspaper that he expected agi to master among other disciplines “cancer climate change energy genomics macroeconomics and financial systems”the conference at which hassabis spoke was called the singularity summit “the singularity” refers to the most likely consequence of the advent of agi according to futurists because agi will process information at high speed it will become very smart very quickly rapid cycles of selfimprovement will lead to an explosion of machine intelligence leaving humans choking on silicon dust since this future is constructed entirely on a scaffolding of untested presumptions it is a matter of almost religious belief whether one considers the singularity to be utopia or helljudging by the titles of talks the attendees at the conference tended towards the messianic “the mind and how to build one” “ai against aging” “replacing our bodies” “modifying the boundary between life and death” hassabis’s speech by contrast appeared underwhelming “a systems neuroscience approach to building agi”hassabis paced between the podium and a screen speaking at a rapid clip he wore a maroon jumper and a white buttondown shirt like a schoolboy his slight stature seemed only to magnify his intellect up until now hassabis explained scientists had approached agi from two directions on one track known as symbolic ai human researchers tried to describe and program all the rules needed for a system that could think like a human this approach was popular in the 1980s and 1990s but hadn’t produced the desired results hassabis believed that the brain’s mental architecture was too subtle to be described in this waythe other track comprised researchers trying to replicate the brain’s physical networks in digital form this made a certain kind of sense after all the brain is the seat of human intelligence but those researchers were also misguided said hassabis their task was on the same scale as mapping every star in the universe more fundamentally it focused on the wrong level of brain function it was like trying to understand how microsoft excel works by tearing open a computer and examining the interactions of the transistorsinstead hassabis proposed a middle ground agi should take inspiration from the broad methods by which the brain processes information – not the physical systems or the particular rules it applies in specific situations in other words it should focus on understanding the brain’s software not its hardware new techniques like functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri which made it possible to peer inside the brain while it engaged in activities had started to make this kind of understanding feasible the latest studies he told the audience showed that the brain learns by replaying experiences during sleep in order to derive general principles ai researchers should emulate this kind of systema logo appeared in the lowerright corner of his opening slide a circular swirl of blue two words closed up were printed underneath it deepmind this was the first time the company had been referred to in public hassabis had spent a year trying to get an invitation to the singularity summit the lecture was an alibi what he really needed was one minute with peter thiel the silicon valley billionaire who funded the conference hassabis wanted thiel’s investmenthassabis has never spoken about why he wanted thiel’s backing in particular hassabis refused multiple interview requests for this article through a spokesperson 1843 spoke to 25 sources including current and former employees and investors most of them spoke anonymously as they were not authorised to talk about the company but thiel believes in agi with even greater fervour than hassabis in a talk at the singularity summit in 2009 thiel had said that his biggest fear for the future was not a robot uprising though with an apocalypseproof bolthole in the new zealand outback he’s better prepared than most people rather he worried that the singularity would take too long coming the world needed new technology to ward off economic declinedeepmind ended up raising £2m thiel contributed £14m when google bought the company in january 2014 for 600m thiel and other early investors earned a 5000 return on their investmentfor many founders this would be a happy ending they could slow down take a step back and spend more time with their money for hassabis the acquisition by google was just another step in his pursuit of agi he had spent much of 2013 negotiating the terms of the deal deepmind would operate as a separate entity from its new parent it would gain the benefits of being owned by google such as access to cash flow and computing power without losing controlhassabis thought deepmind would be a hybrid it would have the drive of a startup the brains of the greatest universities and the deep pockets of one of the world’s most valuable companies every element was in place to hasten the arrival of agi and solve the causes of human miserydemis hassabis was born in north london in 1976 to a greekcypriot father and a chinesesingaporean mother he was the eldest of three siblings his mother worked at john lewis a british department store and his father ran a toy shop he took up chess at the age of four after watching his father and uncle play within weeks he was beating the grownups by 13 he was the secondbest chess player in the world for his age at eight he taught himself to code on a basic computerhassabis completed his alevels in 1992 two years ahead of schedule he got a job programming videogames with bullfrog productions hassabis wrote theme park in which players designed and ran a virtual amusement park it was a huge success selling 15m copies and forming part of a new genre of simulation games in which the goal is not to defeat an opponent but to optimise the functioning of a complex system like a business or a cityas well as making games he was brilliant at playing them as a teen he’d run between floors at boardgame competitions to compete in simultaneous bouts of chess scrabble poker and backgammon in 1995 while studying computer science at cambridge university hassabis wandered into a student go tournament go is an ancient board game of strategy that is considerably more complex than chess mastery is supposed to require intuition acquired by long experience no one knew if hassabis had even played beforefirst hassabis won the beginners’ tournament then he beat the winner of the experienced players albeit with a handicap charles matthews the cambridge go master who ran the tournament remembers the expert player’s shock at being thrashed by a 19yearold novice matthews took hassabis under his winghassabis’s intellect and ambition have always expressed themselves through games games in turn sparked his fascination with intelligence as he observed his own development at chess he wondered whether computers might be programmed to learn as he had through accumulated experience games offered a learning environment that the real world couldn’t match they were neat and contained because games are hived off from the real world they can be practised without interference and mastered efficiently games speed up time players build a crime syndicate in a couple of days and fight the battle of the somme in minutesin the summer of 1997 hassabis travelled to japan that may ibm’s deep blue computer had beaten garry kasparov the world chess champion this was the first time a computer had defeated a grandmaster at chess the match captured the world’s attention and raised concerns over the growing power and potential menace of computers when hassabis met masahiko fujuwarea a japanese boardgame master he spoke of a plan that would combine his interests in strategy games and artificial intelligence one day he would build a computer program to beat the greatest human go playerhassabis approached his career methodically “at the age of 20 hassabis was taking a view that certain things have to be in place before he could go into artificial intelligence at the level he wanted to” says matthews “he had a plan”in 1998 he started a game studio of his own called elixir hassabis focused on one hugely ambitious game republic the revolution an intricate political simulation years earlier when still in school hassabis had told his friend mustafa suleyman that the world needed grand simulations in order to model its complex dynamics and solve the toughest social problems now he tried do so in a gamehis aspirations proved harder than expected to wrangle into code elixir eventually released a pareddown version of the game to lukewarm reviews other games flopped one was a bondvillain simulator called evil genius in april 2005 hassabis shut down elixir matthews believes that hassabis founded the company simply to gain managerial experience now hassabis lacked just one crucial area of knowledge before embarking on his quest for agi he needed to understand the human brainin 2005 hassabis started a phd in neuroscience at university college london ucl he published influential research on memory and imagination one paper which has since been cited over 1000 times showed that people with amnesia also had difficulty imagining new experiences suggesting that there is a connection between remembering and creating mental images hassabis was building up an understanding of the brain required to tackle agi most of his work came back to one question how does the human brain obtain and retain concepts and knowledgehassabis officially founded deepmind on november 15th 2010 the company’s mission statement was the same then as it is now to “solve intelligence” and then use it to solve everything else as hassabis told the singularity summit attendees this means translating our understanding of how the brain accomplished tasks into software that could use the same methods to teach itselfhassabis does not pretend that science has fully comprehended the human mind the blueprint for agi could not simply be drawn from hundreds of neuroscience studies but he clearly believes enough is known to begin work on agi in the manner he would like yet it is possible that his confidence outruns reality we still know very little for certain about how the brain actually functions in 2018 the findings of hassabis’s own phd were called into question by a team of australian researchers the statistics are devilish and this is just a single paper but it shows that the science that underwrites deepmind’s work is far from settledsuleyman and shane legg an agiobsessed new zealander whom hassabis also met at ucl joined as cofounders the firm’s reputation grew rapidly hassabis reeled in talent “he’s a bit of a magnet” says ben faulkner deepmind’s former operations manager many new recruits came from europe beyond the terrible gaze of silicon valley giants like google and facebook perhaps deepmind’s greatest accomplishment was moving early to hire and retain the brightest and best the company set up shop in the attic of a terraced house on russell square in bloomsbury across the road from uclone machinelearning technique that the company focused on grew out of hassabis’s twin fascination with games and neuroscience reinforcement learning such a program is built to gather information about its environment then learn from it by repeatedly replaying its experiences much like the description that hassabis gave of humanbrain activity during sleep in his singularity summit lecturereinforcement learning starts with a computational blank slate the program is shown a virtual environment about which it knows nothing but the rules such as a simulation of a game of chess or a video game the program contains at least one component known as a neural network this is made up of layers of computational structures that sift through information in order to identify particular features or strategies each layer examines the environment at a different level of abstraction at first these networks have minimal success but importantly their failures are encoded within them they become increasingly sophisticated as they experiment with different strategies and are rewarded when they are successful if the program moves a chess piece and loses the game as a result it won’t make that mistake again much of the magic of artificial intelligence lies in the speed at which it repeats its tasksdeepmind’s work culminated in 2016 when a team built an ai program that used reinforcement learning alongside other techniques to play go the program called alphago caused astonishment when it beat the world champion in a fivegame match in seoul in 2016 the machine’s victory watched by 280m people came a decade earlier than experts had predicted the following year an improved version of alphago thrashed the chinese go championlike deep blue in 1997 alphago changed perceptions of human accomplishment the human champions some of the most brilliant minds on the planet no longer stood at the pinnacle of intelligence nearly 20 years after he had confided his ambition to fujuwarea hassabis fulfilled it hassabis has said that the match brought him close to tears traditionally a student of go pays back their teacher by beating them in a single contest hassabis thanked matthews by beating the entire gamedeepblue won through the brute strength and speed of computation but alphago’s style appeared artistic almost human its grace and sophistication the transcendence of its computational muscle seemed to show that deepmind was further ahead than its competitors on the quest for a program that could treat disease and manage citieshassabis has always said that deepmind would change the world for the better but there are no certainties about agi if it ever comes into being we don’t know whether it will be altruistic or vicious or if it will submit to human control even if it does who should take the reinsfrom the start hassabis has tried to protect deepmind’s independence he has always insisted that deepmind remain in london when google bought the company in 2014 the question of control became more pressing hassabis didn’t need to sell deepmind to google there was plenty of cash on hand and he had sketched out a business model in which the company would design games to fund research google’s financial heft was attractive yet like many founders hassabis was reluctant to hand over the company he had nurtured as part of the deal deepmind created an arrangement that would prevent google from unilaterally taking control of the company’s intellectual property in the year leading up to acquisition according to a person familiar with the transaction both parties signed a contract called the ethics and safety review agreement the agreement previously unreported was drawn up by senior barristers in londonthe review agreement puts control of deepmind’s core agi technology whenever it may be created in the hands of a governing panel known as the ethics board far from being a cosmetic concession from google the ethics board gives deepmind solid legal backing to keep control of its most valuable and potentially most dangerous technology according to the same source the names of the panel members haven’t been made public but another source close to both deepmind and google says that all three of deepmind’s founders sit on the board deepmind refused to answer a detailed set of questions about the review agreement but said that “ethics oversight and governance has been a priority for us from the earliest days”hassabis can determine deepmind’s destiny by other means too one is loyalty employees past and present say that hassabis’s research agenda is one of deepmind’s greatest strengths his programme which offers fascinating and important work free from the pressures of academia has attracted hundreds of the world’s most talented experts deepmind has subsidiary offices in paris and alberta many employees feel more affinity with hassabis and his mission than with its revenuehungry corporate parent as long as he retains their personal loyalty hassabis holds considerable power over his sole shareholder better for google to have deepmind’s ai talent working for it by proxy than for those people to end up at facebook or appledeepmind has another source of leverage though it requires constant replenishment favourable publicity the company excels at this alphago was a pr coup since the google acquisition the firm has repeatedly produced marvels that have garnered global attention one piece of software can spot patterns in an eye scan that are indicators of macular degeneration another program learned to play chess from scratch using similar architecture to alphago becoming the greatest chess player of all time after just nine hours playing against itself in december 2018 a program called alphafold proved more accurate than competitors at predicting the threedimensional structure of proteins from a list of their composites potentially paving the way to treat diseases such as parkinson’s and alzheimer’sdeepmind is particularly proud of the algorithms it developed that calculate the most efficient means to cool google’s data centres which contain an estimated 25m computer servers deepmind said in 2016 that they had reduced google’s energy bill by 40 but some insiders say such boasts are overblown google had been using algorithms to optimise its data centres long before deepmind existed “they just want to have some pr so they can claim some value added within alphabet” says one google employee google’s parent alphabet pays deepmind handsomely for services like these deepmind billed £54m to alphabet companies in 2017 that figure pales in comparison to deepmind’s overheads it spent £200m on staff alone that year overall deepmind lost £282m in 2017this is a pittance for the cashrich giant but other alphabet subsidiaries in the red have attracted the attention of ruth porat alphabet’s parsimonious chief financial officer google fiber an effort to build an internetservice provider was put on hiatus after it became clear that it would take decades to make a return on investment ai researchers wonder privately whether deepmind will be “porated”deepmind’s careful unveiling of ai advances forms part of its strategy of managing up signalling its reputational worth to the powers that be that’s especially valuable at a time when google stands accused of invading users’ privacy and spreading fake news deepmind is also lucky to have a sympathiser at the highest level larry page one of google’s two founders now chief executive of alphabet page is the closest thing that hassabis has to a boss page’s father carl studied neural networks in the 1960s early in his career page said that he built google solely to found an ai companydeepmind’s tight control needed for press management doesn’t gel with the academic spirit that pervades the company some researchers complain that it can be difficult to publish their work they have to battle through layers of internal approval before they can even submit work to conferences and journals deepmind believes that it needs to proceed carefully to avoid scaring the public with the prospect of agi but clamming up too tightly could start to sour the academic atmosphere and weaken the loyalty of employeesfive years after the acquisition by google the question of who controls deepmind is coming to a crunch point the firm’s founders and early employees are approaching earnout when they can leave with the financial compensation that they received from the acquisition hassabis’s stock was probably worth around £100m but a source close to the company suggests that alphabet has pushed back the founders’ earnouts by two years given his relentless focus hassabis is unlikely to jump ship he is interested in money only in so far as it helps him achieve his life’s work but some colleagues have already left three ai engineers have departed since the start of 2019 and ben laurie one of the world’s most prominent security engineers has now returned to google his previous employer this number is small but deepmind offers such an exhilarating mission and handsome pay that it is rare for anyone to leaveso far google has not interfered much with deepmind but one recent event has raised concerns over how long the company can sustain its independencedeepmind had always planned to use ai to improve health care in february 2016 it set up a new division deepmind health led by mustafa suleyman one of the company’s cofounders suleyman whose mother was an nhs nurse hoped to create a program called streams that would warn doctors when a patient’s health deteriorated deepmind would earn a performancebased fee because this work required access to sensitive information about patients suleyman established an independent review panel irp populated by the great and good of british health care and technology deepmind was wise to proceed with care the british information commissioner subsequently found that one of the partner hospitals broke the law in handling patient data nonetheless by the end of 2017 suleyman had signed agreements with four large nhs hospitalson november 8th 2018 google reported the creation of its own healthcare division google health five days later it was announced that deepmind health was to be rolled into its parent company’s efforts deepmind appeared to have had little warning according to information gained from freedom of information requests it gave its partner hospitals only three days’ notice of the change deepmind refused to say when discussions about the merger began but said that the short gap between the notification and a public announcement was in the interests of transparency suleyman had written in 2016 that “at no stage will patient data ever be linked or associated with google accounts products or services” his promise seemed to have been broken in response to 1843’s questions deepmind said that “at this stage none of our contracts have moved across to google and they only will with our partners’ consent streams becoming a google service does not mean the patient datacan be used to provide other google products or services”google’s annexation has angered employees at deepmind health according to people close to the health team more employees plan to leave the company once the absorption is complete one member of the irp mike bracken has already walked out on suleyman according to multiple people familiar with the event bracken quit in december 2017 over concerns that the panel was more about windowdressing than genuine oversight when bracken asked suleyman if he would give panel members the accountability and governance powers of nonexecutive directors suleyman scoffed a spokesperson for deepmind said they had “no recollection” of the incident julian huppert the head of the irp argues that the panel delivered “more radical governance” than bracken expected because members were able to speak openly and not bound by a duty of confidentialitythis episode shows that peripheral parts of deepmind’s operation are vulnerable to google deepmind said in a statement that “we all agreed that it makes sense to bring these efforts together in one collaborative effort with increased resources” this begs the question of whether google will apply the same logic to deepmind’s work on agifrom a distance deepmind looks to have taken great strides it has already built software that can learn to perform tasks at superhuman levels hassabis often cites breakout a videogame for the atari console a breakout player controls a bat that she can move horizontally across the bottom of the screen using it to bounce a ball against blocks that hover above it destroying them on impact the player wins when all blocks are obliterated she loses if she misses the ball with the bat without human instruction deepmind’s program not only learned to play the game but also worked out how to cannon the ball into the space behind the blocks taking advantage of rebounds to break more blocks this hassabis says demonstrates the power of reinforcement learning and the preternatural ability of deepmind’s computer programsit’s an impressive demo but hassabis leaves a few things out if the virtual paddle were moved even fractionally higher the program would fail the skill learned by deepmind’s program is so restricted that it cannot react even to tiny changes to the environment that a person would take in their stride – at least not without thousands more rounds of reinforcement learning but the world has jitter like this built into it for diagnostic intelligence no two bodily organs are ever the same for mechanical intelligence no two engines can be tuned in the same way so releasing programs perfected in virtual space into the wild is fraught with difficultythe second caveat which deepmind rarely talks about is that success within virtual environments depends on the existence of a reward function a signal that allows software to measure its progress the program learns that ricocheting off the back wall makes its score go up much of deepmind’s work with alphago lay in constructing a reward function compatible with such a complex game unfortunately the real world doesn’t offer simple rewards progress is rarely measured by single scores where such measures exist political challenges complicate the problem reconciling the reward signal for climate health the concentration of co₂ in the atmosphere with the reward signal for oil companies share price requires satisfying many human beings with conflicted motivations reward signals tend to be very weak it is rare for human brains to receive explicit feedback about the success of a task while in the midst of itdeepmind has found a way around this by employing vast amounts of computer power alphago takes thousands of years of human gameplaying time to learn anything many ai thinkers suspect this solution is unsustainable for tasks that offer weaker rewards deepmind acknowledges the existence of such ambiguities it has recently focused on starcraft 2 a strategy computer game decisions taken early in the game have ramifications later on which is closer to the sort of convoluted and delayed feedback that characterises many realworld tasks in january deepmind software beat some of the world’s top human players in a demo that while heavily constrained was still impressive its programs have also begun to learn reward functions by following the feedback of human taskmasters but putting human instruction in the loop risks losing the effects of scale and speed that unadulterated computerprocessing offeredcurrent and former researchers at deepmind and google who requested anonymity due to stringent nondisclosure agreements have also expressed scepticism that deepmind can reach agi through such methods to these individuals the focus on achieving high performance within simulated environments makes the rewardsignal problem hard to tackle yet this approach is at the heart of deepmind it has an internal leaderboard in which programs from competing teams of coders vie for mastery over virtual domainshassabis has always seen life as a game a large part of his career was devoted to making them a large part of his leisure time has been spent playing them at deepmind they are his chosen vehicle for developing agi just like his software hassabis can learn only from his experiences the pursuit of agi may eventually lose its way having invented some useful medical technologies and outclassed the world’s greatest boardgame players significant achievements but not the one he craves but he could yet usher agi into being right under google’s nose but beyond its control if he does this demis hassabis will have beaten the toughest game of all •hal hodsonis technology correspondent for the

evidence in the human genome of a “ghost population” of human ancestors the analysis suggests that a previously unknown and longextinct group of hominins interbred with homo sapiens in asia and oceania somewhere along the long winding road of human evolutionary history leaving behind only fragmented traces in modern human dnathe study published in nature communications is one of the first examples of how machine learning can help reveal clues to our own origins by poring through vast amounts of genomic data left behind in fossilized bones and comparing it with dna in modern humans scientists can begin to fill in some of the gaps of our species’ evolutionary historyin this case the results seem to match paleoanthropology theories that were developed from studying human ancestor fossils found in the ground the new data suggest that the mysterious hominin was likely descended from an admixture of neanderthals and denisovans who were only identified as a unique species on the human family tree in 2010 such a species in our evolutionary past would look a lot like the fossil of a 90000yearold teenage girl from siberias denisova cave her remains were described last summer as the only known example of a firstgeneration hybrid between the two species with a neanderthal mother and a denisovan father“its exactly the kind of individual we expect to find at the origin of this population however this should not be just a single individual but a whole population” says study coauthor jaume bertranpetit an evolutionary biologist at barcelonas pompeu fabra universityprevious human genome studies have revealed that after modern humans left africa perhaps 180000 years ago they subsequently interbred with species like neanderthals and denisovans who coexisted with early modern humans before going extinct but redrawing our family tree to include these divergent branches has been difficult evidence for “ghost” species can be sparse and many competing theories exist to explain when where and how often homo sapiens might have interbred with other speciestraces of these ancient interspecies liaisons called introgressions can be identified as places of divergence in the human genome scientists observe more separation between two chromosomes than youd expect if both of the chromosomes came from the same human species when scientists sequenced the neanderthal genome in 2010 they realized that some of these divergences represented fractions of our genome that came from neanderthals studies have also revealed that some living humans can trace as much as 5 percent of their ancestry to denisovans“so we thought wed try to find these places of high divergence in the genome see which are neanderthal and which are denisovan and then see whether these explain the whole picture” bertranpetit says “as it happens if you subtract the neanderthal and denisovan parts there is still something in the genome that is highly divergent”identifying and analyzing the many divergent places throughout the genome and computing the countless genetic combinations that could have produced them is too big a job for humans to tackle on their own—but its a task that may be tailor made for deep learning algorithmsdeep learning is a type of artificial intelligence in which algorithms are designed to work as an artificial neural network or a program that can process information the same way a mammalian brain would these machine learning systems can detect patterns and account for previous information to “learn” allowing them to perform new tasks or look for new information after analyzing enormous amounts of data a common example is google deepmind’s alphazero which can teach itself to master board games“deep learning is fitting a more complicated shaped thing to a set of points in a bigger space” says joshua schraiber an evolutionary genomics expert at temple university “instead of fitting a line between y and x youre fitting some squiggly thing to a set of points in much bigger thousanddimensional space deep learning says ‘i dont know what squiggly shape should fit to these points but lets see what happens’”in this case machines were set to work analyzing the human genome and predicting human demographics by simulating how our dna might have evolved over many thousands of possible scenarios of ancient evolution the program accounted for the structure and evolution of dna as well as models of human migration and interbreeding to try to fit some of the pieces together in an incredibly complex puzzlethe researchers trained the computer to analyze eight different models of the most plausible theories of early human evolution across eurasia the models came from previous studies that attempted to come up with a scenario that would result in the current picture of the human genome including its known neanderthal and denisovan components“there could be other models of course but these models are the ones that other people have been proposing in the scientific literature” bertranpetit says each model begins with the accepted outofafrica event then features a different set of the most likely splits between human lineages including various interbreedings with both known species and possible “ghost” species“with each of these eight models we calculate over weeks of computations how well they are able to reach the actual present genetic composition of humans” bertranpetit says “every time we do a simulation its a simulation of a possible path of human evolution and we have run those simulations thousands of times and the deep learning algorithms are able to recognize which of the models best suit the data”the machine’s conclusion an ancestor species is present in our lineage that we have yet to identify “by far the only models we tested that really are backed by the data are the ones having this ghost population introgression” bertranpetit saysthe intriguing study and others like it may help redraw the map of how humans migrated and evolved though what appears to be an increasingly complicated ancient world in eurasia and oceania“it’s certainly interesting and consistent with the emerging picture of a complex reticulated phylogeny in human evolution” iain mathieson a university of pennsylvania population geneticist says via email “i’m not even sure it makes sense to talk about introgression events when that seems to be the norm” in fact because only eight models were tested and many others could be possible mathieson adds that the new findings are “certainly a plausible scenario but the reality is likely even more complex”as new fossil discoveries are made in the field updated models can now be tested against the human genome using these types of programs schraiber says the power of deep learning for studying human origins lies precisely in its capability to analyze complex models“if you want to do an extremely detailed model because youre an anthropologist and you want to know if this introgression happened 80000 years ago or 40000 years ago thats the power of a deep learning approach like this”complex as they are the interbreedings of ancient eurasia are still only one part of our human story bertranpetit believes that future advances in deep learning can help uncover other new chapters“this kind of method of analysis is going to have all kinds of new results” he says “i am sure that people working in africa will find extinct groups that are not recognized yet no doubt africa is going to show us surprising things in the future”brian handwerk is a freelance writer

defense industry news sign up for the breaking defense newsletterupdated adds expert analysiswashington the pentagon has created a new joint artificial intelligence center jaic that will have oversight over almost all service and defense agency ai efforts this coordination function is crucial to the emerging ai arms race with russia and china experts told usthe jaic will report to chief information officer dana deasy the establishing memo by deputy defense secretary patrick shanahan says its ambit is not quite untrammeled any projects under 15 million remain the authority of the service or agency the jaic will establish a common set of ai “standards… tools shared data reusable technology processes and expertise” for the whole defense department according to the june 27 memodana deasyundersecretary for research engineering mike griffin a far more prominent proponent of ai and other cuttingedge technologies who has warned china and russia are catching up to the us “will continue to promote development of new ai technologies systems and concepts” but without any clearly specified role in the new centercio deasy has 30 days to consult the rest of the department and report back with a list of initial “national mission initiatives” for jaic to start working on in 90 days by september 27 even though that start date is just three days before the end of fiscal year 2018 ’18 funding will be made available asap to “enable implementation of select ai initiatives in fy 18” the memo makes clear the ’18 funds may well require congressional approval for a budget reprogramming action while 2019 money will require an amendment or supplement to appropriations bills already moving through congressshanahan specifies that the first national mission initiative will be the controversial project maven already in progress google is withdrawing from its maven contract after employees objected that the military’s use of google ai to analyze surveillance video could be used to target lethal drone strikes project maven founder and former deputy defense secretary bob work has countered it could also save lives by killing terrorists before they attack or preventing us strikes that might cause collateral damage he also notes that google is working with elements of the chinese government on ai no doubt with this debate in mind shanahan writes in the very first paragraph of the memo that “we must pursue ai applications with boldness and alacrity while ensuring strong commitment to military ethics and ai safety”patrick shanahanshanahan directs cio deasy to consult with the services joint staff combatant commands and other dod entities on the initial list of national mission initiatives those entities in return are to “coordinate” with the cio on “each ai initiative that totals more than 15 million annually” although that threshold “will be reviewed annually as investments in ai mature” — which presumably means it’ll go up as ai projects become more routine for scale google’s initial project maven contract was just 9 million but the company projected it would swiftly grow to 15 million and ultimately 250 millionjaic will also coordinate with other government agencies “industry academics and us allies” the memo says update begins “harnessing the strengths of industry and academia is crucial and that is explicitly called out” said larry lewis director of cna’s center for autonomy and ai “it’s not necessarily going to be easy but including the discussion about ethics and ai safety so prominently is going to be an important piece of that”finding the missing pieces“i’m very excited to hear about the stand up of the new jaic” said bob work former deputy secretary of defense and one of the pentagon’s foremost proponents of artificial intelligence “the defense innovation board recommended the department create an ai center of excellence nearly a year and a half ago although i wish it had not taken this long to create it the jaic is an important step forward in exploring and pushing ai and machine learning throughout the department for both operational and business applications”former deputy defense secretary bob work“the jaic’s initial funding is quite modest and we have a lot to learn about its mission and activities” work cautioned “but its standup is a welcome first step in response to chinese and to a lesser extent russian plans to dominate these technologies”“this is a big deal” cna’s lewis agreed “this is an acknowledgment that the us is in a new competitive security environment and that ai is likely to be decisive”“it gives organizational focus” lewis said of the jaic in shanahan’s memo “it talks about bringing to bear resources and expertise and then it talks about providing foundational pieces that dod is currently missing”larry lewis“one of those is data processes curating data” lewis continued “we have many systems out there that collect intelligence or collect surveillance but we don’t necessarily keep it all and we don’t necessarily have it in formats that can be easily exploited with machine learning” — indeed many of the formats aren’t even compatible with each other — “so we have some foundational work to do to be able to bring all the data that we have to bear” massed data is critical because modern ais refine their algorithms through machine learning and the more data they have to go through the better that’s assuming the data is not polluted by unintentional bias or deliberate disinformationupdate endsbeyond creating a pool of data the jaic mission also includes creating common processes technologies and tools that all of dod can draw on as well as a central body of ai experts to consult with “you don’t need everyone to be a phd data science person” lewis said “you have some experts that can develop algorithms but you have to marry that technical expertise with people who understand military operations”that preserves a vital role for the four armed services “this is not an overly centralized process” lewis said “it the memo emphasizes several times this is in collaboration with the services… it brings focus and it brings enablers that are then used by the different services”what’s not clear yet lewis said is the role of the undersecretary for research and engineering mike griffin that’s something that the pentagon will have to work out over time perhaps as part of its forthcoming ai strategyan experimental russian robot fedor shoots pistolscountering russia chinaupdate begins how does jaic compare to competitors’ efforts in ai the chinese government has officially made global dominance in ai a national priority while russia constantly touts its combat robots fieldtested in syria and elsewheresam bendett“within the russian ministry of defense there are now two centers responsible for the development of the latest breakthrough technologies such as autonomous weapons but no specific agencywide effort to develop ai center like jaic” said cna scholar sam bendett a close observer of russian military technology “on the other hand the mod has lots of ai and other hightech rd taking place amongst its numerous academic institutions an effort that the mod is keen on consolidating further’in fact in a development strangely reminiscent of the soviet era the russians are actually building a “city” on the black sea for ai and related research with a planned population of at least 2000 engineers and scientists by 2020 “currently lots of efforts are going towards the establishment and staffing of the era ‘technopolis” said bendett “a 50acre city with st and rd centerslaboratories and living spaces for soldiers and private sector workers who will be developing numerous projects for the nation’s military with a specific focus on ai autonomy and big data analytics”the russians are watching us developments closely and will probably react to jaic’s creation with “a certain degree of apprehension” bendett told me mainly because of how it might help the pentagon tap into america’s massive private sector investment in artificial intelligence “currently russian ai funding is only a small fraction of what is spent in the us or china for that matter” he said“we do have a very strong commercial sector” agreed fellow cna analyst larry lewis “but unlike china we are going to be more challenged to leverage that for national security as we’ve seen with the example in google” google’s decision to opt out of a military contract would simply be unthinkable for a chinese company he told me “in china you’re free to do business but if the government wants something of yours it’s theirs”elsa kania“at the highest levels the chinese government is prioritizing and directing strong state support to ai development leveraging and harnessing the dynamism of the ‘national champions’ including baidu alibaba and tencent that are at the forefront of china’s ai revolution” said cnas scholar elsa kania “china’s approach might be characterized as statedriven but marketcentric with an integrated approach combing academia tech companies the defense industry and the military…a national strategy of civilmilitary fusion”“for instance baidu is partnering with the cetc a major stateowned defense conglomerate through the joint laboratory for intelligent command and control technologies which seeks to advance the use of big data artificial intelligence and cloud computing for military command and information systems” kania went on “this spring the chinese military launched what might be characterized as a wouldbe diux with chinese characteristics this ‘rapid response team’ launched in shenzhen is intended to enhance the pla’s capability to leverage advanced commercial technologies for military purposes”chinese president xi jinping inspects pla troopsso while the us has strong tradition of innovation entrepreneurship and individual creativity china is investing heavily in ai its capabilities are growing rapidly and its government is systematically tapping civilian innovation for military use but that’s not all “the other strength that they have is they have lots and lots of data” to train machine learning algorithms lewis noted “china has many more people they don’t have privacy concerns so they have advantages there that we don’t have”“the major challenge for the us is china” lewis said “not only do they have comparable capabilities in the commercial sector which is really important but…they have a national strategy they are approaching the use of ai just like the us approached going to the moon in the sixties”the full memo is reproduced belowestablishment of the joint artificial intelligence center osd00841218 r… by breakingdefense on scribdtopics artificial

volunteeringwant to pitch in for your community but arenâ\x80\x99t quite sure how here are some tips and advicefull articleone of the most exciting themes in science technology and economics today is the transformative potential of artificial intelligence ai and automation but finding the best way to invest in this theme is not always obviousthe emergence of intelligent machines sometimes known as â\x80\x9cthe fourth industrial revolutionâ\x80\x9d has the power to disrupt many aspects of the business world while investment in ai and machine learning has come in and out of vogue since first discussed in the 1950s the current mix of economic forces could unleash a wave of spendingnew tax rules provide incentives for investment in addition higher wage costs are driving businesses to increase capital spending to improve efficiency in the competitive global economy another longterm motivation is demographic in nature the developed world has a unique challenge with many countries facing labor shortfalls by 2050 the us alone will likely face an 18million worker shortfallfind a financial advisor branch and private wealth advisor near youinvalid zipcodeif the ai industry grows at a compound annual rate of 154 my current estimate it could reach nearly 1 trillion in revenues by 2050 based on automation replacing the projected shortfall of 18 million us workers with europe japan and china facing similar demographic deficits that growth estimate is likely conservativeno company or set of companies has advanced a single dominant ai technology many firms have focused on more narrowly defined taskoriented elements of machine learning rather than on developing general artificial intelligence instead of a single ai application for all purposes investors should expect multiple ais or algorithms blended for specific cognitive and physical taskscommercializing ai technologies is still in the early stages while many investors might begin their search among the companies that provide the actual automation services they may find greater opportunities in firms that supply raw inputs required by ai algorithms or in the companies that use the core technologies to improve their primary businessmy advice for investors gain exposure to the technology across the ai ecosystemâ\x80\x94upstream core and downstream below is additional information on each segmentupstream companies supplying the raw material for core ai technologies include providers of processing power used in supercomputers and cloud data centers as well as those with access to vast pools of data upstream opportunities also likely exist with companies that have expertise in data structuring not just collecting data but organizing it as well as those with expertise in training the machines ai also requires advanced sensors and control systemsnot all companies in these sectors will benefit equally technology that could make one semiconductor company a leader in smart phones might not have the processing power for aiâ\x80\x99s highcapacity needscore this group consists of the companies developing the actual artificial intelligence applications right now a few leaders and many small startups are exploring new technologies with a few firms advertising ai capabilities and products on the market but many are still experimenting with applications as is typical in technology the first to market with a new product doesnâ\x80\x99t always become the dominant playerlarge companies may have the upper hand since they have already invested in extensive processing and cloud computing services that can help them deliver ai applications to existing customers ai is a smaller component of total revenue and earnings for these players many of which serve other markets smaller companies may turn out to be fastgrowers if they possess winning technologies but the potential uses for ai are so wide that the market can likely accommodate a number of playersdownstream the companies that make best use of the advances created by ai are also beneficiaries of the new technologies predicting which companies will successfully seize the opportunity is hard they have to invest in new technologies and then execute on strategies effectivelycompanies that have high labor costs tied to simple repetitive tasks think fast food are probably the most obvious beneficiaries of ai retail and consumer goods firms are likely to benefit from improved profit margins as labor costs shrink industries with high customerservice demands could also benefit as natural language processing and machine learning improve however integrating these technologies efficiently into operations will likely prove difficult for some large firmsbottom line while ai and automation promise to be some of the most exciting growth areas in the market this industry is still in its early days investors who focus on this theme should keep well in mind the basic investing tenet of diversificationâ\x80\x94both in their broader portfolio and as it applies to the emerging ai sectorthis article was derived from the february 27 issue of alphacurrents a monthly wealth management investment resources publication which covers thematic investing for more information on artificial intelligence and automation ask your financial advisor for a copyrisk considerationsequity securities may fluctuate in response to news on companies industries market conditions and general economic environmentgrowth investing does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk the stocks of these companies can have relatively high valuations because of these high valuations an investment in a growth stock can be more risky than an investment in a company with more modest growth expectations value investing does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk not all companies whose stocks are considered to be value stocks are able to turn their business around or successfully employ corrective strategies which would result in stock prices that do not rise as initially expectedinternational investing entails greater risk as well as greater potential rewards compared to us investing these risks include political and economic uncertainties of foreign countries as well as the risk of currency fluctuations these risks are magnified in countries with emerging and frontier markets since these countries may have relatively unstable governments and less established markets and economiesalternative investments often are speculative and include a high degree of risk investors could lose all or a substantial amount of their investment alternative investments are suitable only for eligible longterm investors who are willing to forgo liquidity and put capital at risk for an indefinite period of time they may be highly illiquid and can engage in leverage and other speculative practices that may increase the volatility and risk of loss alternative investments typically have higher fees than traditional investments investors should carefully review and consider potential risks before investingbecause of their narrow focus sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies technology stocks may be especially volatileasset allocation and diversification do not assure a profit or protect against

cryptocurrency ponzi scheme that defrauded 56000 people of more than 187 millionthe fraudsters targeted people who had little to no idea of how cryptocurrency worked and lured them in with juicy bonuses and free cryptocurrency the korea joongang daily reportsfollowing the arrest of 12 people behind the scam the seoul special judicial police bureau for public safety revealed that the vast majority of the fraudulent scheme’s victims were elderly people between the ages of 60 and 70 years the ceos of the ponzi scheme identified only as lee and bae were arrested after the agency created an ai to track keywords related to ponzi schemes and internet fraudexplaining how the ai works hong namki section chief of the bureau’s second investigation team saidthrough keywords such as ponzi loan and recruiting members we were able to teach the ai patterns of ponzi schemes the program can also identify advertisement patterns and identified the enterprise in question which was caught with evidence provided by an unnamed informantthe ponzi scheme which started in may 2018 had about 201 offices that it operated from offering huge incentives to managers and members who brought in other people to join in a classic pyramid scheme format lee and bae made the bulk of their money from selling an unlisted cryptocurrency called mcoin at 087 per token promising members that the fake crypto would rise as high as 52 representing a profit of about 600 percentthe ‘mcoin’ scam targeted naive koreans with promises of heightened rewards source shutterstockthe pyramid scheme also pulled in funds through membership fees which ranged from 287 to as high as 863 for premium membership which purportedly included discounts on funerals lodgings and weddings the scheme’s promoters also promised cash incentives up to 100 for every new member introduced to the network by a downlineunlike typically flashy and visible ponzi scheme promoters lee and bae stayed under the radar keeping a tight lid on any information about the scheme’s cashflow and members according to the agency they went as far as hiding all of their accounting information on a server in japan and moving to a private house when they found out that the police were on to them to all intents and purposes the founders intended to keep it running for as long as possible in a departure from the typical slashandrun approach of crypto scammersthe elaborate scheme even had a membersonly shopping website designed to make it more convincing to potential victims as well as a crypto exchange based in the trendy gangnam district of seoulthis case may well mark a watershed in the ongoing global backandforth surrounding cryptocurrency regulation several governments have been introduced to cryptocurrency adoption through the unfortunate means of crypto ponzi schemes which has negatively colored their impression of the technology india for example continues to project a broadly hostile regulatory stance on cryptocurrency following the damaging outcomes of several indian crypto scams like bitconnectfor these countries which are often led by barely competent and often overstretched governments the added danger of financial collapse presented by the widespread adoption of cryptocurrency scams makes them firewall any attempt o create regulation aimed at helping adoption the reasoning is that it is much easier and cheaper to simply issue a blanket ban or refuse to officially acknowledge crypto than to embrace it and deal with the cost implication of creating new crimefighting and law enforcement organizations to deal with a new type of threatthe successful use of ai to fish out crypto scams however could significantly alter this picture if the technology becomes widely available it would mean that such governments no longer need to detail overstretched law enforcement resources to deal with an added threat which greatly reduces the potential cost of crypto adoptioni am a busy writer

gartnertoday’s customers live in an omnichannel world but most companies still force these evolved customers onto engagement paths that are steeped in legacy and instantly feel outdatedartificial intelligence can be successfully employed to provide an intelligent convenient and informed customer experience at any point along the customer journey this will result in reimagined customer experiences and endtoend customer journeys that are integrated and more personal so that they feel more natural to customersin this post i will lay out why artificial intelligence is a game changer in cx take a look under the hood at how ai is applied to cx and explore use cases for how leading edge companies are already reaping benefits from ai applications in customer experiencecustomer experience is a competitive driver of growth when successful and the greatest source of risk when failing data insights are one of the primary tools for cx enhancement cx datasets are messy however and the customer behaviors are chaotic the rules are undefined and the success criteria are ambiguous cx is the nightmare dataset for an ai developerat the same time this complexity is precisely the reason why ai can unleash so much value across the customer experience salespeople call center agents and employees in other customerfacing roles cannot be expected to understand a customer’s entire history and derive their own insights from it in real timeautomated systems cannot be handprogrammed with rules to handle every conceivable customer history delivering a coherent experience across all enterprise touchpoints requires finding patterns across an overwhelming number of data points this is prime stomping ground for aithe successful application of ai in customer experience requires 3 fundamental capabilitiescustomers expect a unified experience and are disappointed – and vocal – when companies fail to deliver ai and customer journey analytics are key components in assembling businesses with one voice joined across silos and touchpointsdata unification is a must for any type of behavioral analytics ai thrives on information—the more the betterthe new generation of data unification tools make this daunting task cheap fast and relatively painfree customer journey analytics platforms provide this service for a fraction of the cost of the dedicated data services providers of yore—even delivering a level of data integration free of chargethe tedium of pulling together dozens of data sources is now just background noise expect timelines of days not weeks with simpler data sources integrated within 13 daysit’s a far cry from the expansive data engineering initiatives that likely still haunt your dreamsfor ai to impact the customer experience insights need to be conveyed in the moment through the customer’s chosen touchpoint integrating with these touchpoints is the key to inthemoment engagementmost leading saas platforms have apis and consider 3rdparty integrations to be a critical component of their value proposition the world would be a beautiful place if all touchpoint data was available through apisthe truth is that in addition to elegant saas data streams most enterprises must rely on myriad onsite homegrown and legacy touchpoint data sources—product interfaces payment platforms pointofsale systems customer care etc this reality creates a challenge for delivering realtime insights and are still very much a custom affaircustomer journey analytics platforms are now filling this gap with a host of apis options and development kits to deliver comprehensive realtime touchpoint integration with minimal investmentfor a simple isolated interaction ai is able to deliver results by simply knowing that an email is an email and a campaign is a campaign our web analytics and crm platforms take advantage of this inherent luxurybut in holistic crosschannel journey analytics the idea that touchpoints of a similar category will be the same across enterprises is an antiquated notioncustomer journeys are as unique to individual businesses as fingerprints every company has their own set of touchpoints and a distinct method for employing those engagements in their customer experiencefor ai to deliver value it must be given some context by context i mean more than simply designating a certain interaction as an “inbound call” and another as “order fulfillment” ai must know the significance of these events in shaping a customer behavior that requires an awareness of both the journey that these touchpoints helped to shape and the kpis which were subsequently impacted by that customer behavior—whether related to revenue profitability customer lifetime value customer satisfaction or other factors driving highlevel business performancearmed with that information ai systems can do more than find the “next best action” or the optimal audience with proper business context an ai can find touchpoints and tactics which actually shape the customer behaviors behind the business’s primary measures of performancenow that we understand what it takes to successfully apply artificial intelligence in customer experience let’s delve into some of those applications to see how ai is unleashing disruption across various aspects of customer experience by unifying data providing insights in realtime and incorporating critical business contextai’s biggest impact undoubtedly will be to transform customer service by making it automated fast and hasslefree as i previously mentioned salespeople call center agents and employees in other customer service roles cannot be expected to ingest and understand a customer’s entire history prior to each conversation but artificial intelligence is now making it possiblehere’s how ai applications are giving customer service a makeoverchatbots are aibased conversation agents that are being used in many different customerengagement scenarios they are designed to simulate human interactions and provide immediate personalized responses 247 this eliminates frustrating delays and errors in customer service particularly for handling customer complaintsvirtual assistants utilize ai to obey commands or answer questions online retailer spring was one of the first to start using facebook’s messenger bot store to offer a personal shopping assistant it helps shoppers find what they are looking for by engaging them in simple conversationsimage source forbescomartificial intelligence is helping businesses create experiences that naturally integrate with consumers’ everyday lives consumers will no longer change their pattern of communication when interacting with brands in order to satisfy their needs intelligent prediction and customization will make customers feel as if every product or brand experience was tailored just for themcompanies will be able to assess individual shopper inventories and consumer behaviors to predict and deliver goods to homes before they even realize they are running low selfdriving cars will use their knowledge of preferred routes and invehicle entertainment drawn from past behavior to optimize daily commutes and long roadtrips even asking for help will become easier as ai infused with emotions will make customer experience interactions smoother and streamlined across channelsoptimal customer experience is achieved when a business remembers a customer and treats them with attention respect and consideration throughout their unique customer journeymining insights across billions of unique customer journeys using traditional analytics methods and tools is a laborious and slow process which tends to confine it’s usage to a small set of predefined problemsthe power of aienabled customer journey analytics is that it can sift through a much much larger and more complex data space and thereby uncover many more business opportunities—even opportunities you didn’t realize you should look for as a result you can spend your time prioritizing these insights instead of hammering away at the underlying dataaienabled customer journey analytics finds every single relationship in the data that existswithout expressly being told to look for it it can predict the likelihood of future behaviors with high accuracy while simultaneously finding the drivers and inhibitors of customer performanceaienabled customer analytics mines a vast dynamic sea of data for actionable insightsartificial intelligenceenabled customer journey analytics can find answers to important cx queries likeleading companies are constantly experimenting to determine the best way to employ ai to improve customer experience these companies have unified disparate customer data sources analyzed endtoend customer journeys and are using machine learning algorithms to predict future customer behavior they are reaping the rewards through quantifiable improvements in customer experience increased customer lifetime value and reduced churnlarge banks have thousands of customer touchpoints that capture millions of customer interactions every day making customer experience a minefield for them to navigate nordea a stockholmbased bank has looked deep into the customer journey to find the best points to deploy ai for maximum impactthey recently introduced virtual employees that perform repetitive tasks faster and more efficiently than their human counterparts these virtual employees liv in stockholm erma in denmark roberta in norway sirius in finland among others are empowered to take correct and fast

of products seamlessly and driven by the ai engine personalized recommendations and offers are made in realtime when the visitor is ready to buy the product the checkout is of course made as smooth and painless as possibleskiequipment retailer black diamond realized the value of using ai for personalized engagement long before its peers the company knew that the oldschool customer experience which required hours of browsing to find the best product was not going to cut it anymoreskiers often know exactly what equipment they need to stay safe and compete such as avalanche airbags black diamond predicts these needs and pushes the right items to website visitors rather than waiting till they checkout to make suggestionsthey use sophisticated analytics to glean insights from a customer’s purchasing history and combine it with weather conditions and other relevant data to make product recommendations in realtime this effort has reaped rewards for black diamond increasing sales significantly and dropping cart abandonment ratesit is not hard to imagine how b2b businesses too can benefit from the same applications of artificial intelligence in customer experience aienabled tools can automate customercentric tasks to increase productivity and enhance customer experience at b2b workplaces by orders of magnitudeit can create data where previously there was none and analyze this data to predict future customer behavior for example salesforce’s artificial intelligence technology called einstein uses machine learning algorithms to analyze customer conversations as they happen it then alerts managers in realtime whenever an opportunity to enhance customer experience solve a problem or crosssellupsell arisesai presents an opportunity to turn manysiloed multichannel enterprises into singular “personas” who remember understand and respond to their customers’ achievements and setbacks in a meaningful way the ability to speak with one voice is the difference between shareworthy and forgettablethe challenge however lies in determining how to start developing the right processes and expertise for collecting data—as well as building ai algorithms and models—swiftly enough to reap the benefits most companies find it difficult if not impossible to accomplish those tasks on their own given the dearth of data scientists the fact that disparate systems are not ai ready and the need to rapidly build new systems apps and capabilities moreover companies are only now waking up to the idea of applying ai to improve cx—so most don’t even know how or where to beginthis is where a sophisticated aienabled customer journey analytics platform can help deliver highimpact customer experiences rapidly and effectivelyit is time to stop treating

and pia ramchandanitagslearn about the artificial intelligence advances that will have the most impactartificial intelligence is front and center with business and government leaders pondering the right moves but what’s happening in the lab where discoveries by academic and corporate researchers will set ai’s course for the coming year and beyond our own team of researchers from pwc’s ai accelerator has homed in on the leading developments both technologists and business leaders should watch closely here’s what they are and why they matter also see our top ai trends for business herewhat it is deep neural networks which mimic the human brain have demonstrated their ability to “learn” from image audio and text data yet even after being in use for more than a decade there’s still a lot we don’t yet know about deep learning including how neural networks learn or why they perform so well that may be changing thanks to a new theory that applies the principle of an information bottleneck to deep learning in essence it suggests that after an initial fitting phase a deep neural network will “forget” and compress noisy data—that is data sets containing a lot of additional meaningless information—while still preserving information about what the data representswhy it matters understanding precisely how deep learning works enables its greater development and use for example it can yield insights into optimal network design and architecture choices while providing increased transparency for safetycritical or regulatory applications expect to see more results from the exploration of this theory applied to other types of deep neural networks and deep neural network designwhat it is capsule networks a new type of deep neural network process visual information in much the same way as the brain which means they can maintain hierarchical relationships this is in stark contrast to convolutional neural networks one of the most widely used neural networks which fail to take into account important spatial hierarchies between simple and complex objects resulting in misclassification and a high error ratewhy it matters for typical identification tasks capsule networks promise better accuracy via reduction of errors—by as much as 50 percent they also don’t need as much data for training models expect to see the widespread use of capsule networks across many problem domains and deep neural network architectureswhat it is a type of neural network that learns by interacting with the environment through observations actions and rewards deep reinforcement learning drl has been used to learn gaming strategies such as atari and go—including the famous alphago program that beat a human championwhy it matters drl is the most general purpose of all learning techniques so it can be used in the most business applications it requires less data than other techniques to train its models even more notable is the fact that it can be trained via simulation which eliminates the need for labeled data entirely given these advantages expect to see more business applications that combine drl and agentbased simulation in the coming yearwhat it is a generative adversarial network gan is a type of unsupervised deep learning system that is implemented as two competing neural networks one network the generator creates fake data that looks exactly like the real data set the second network the discriminator ingests real and synthetic data over time each network improves enabling the pair to learn the entire distribution of the given data setwhy it matters gans open up deep learning to a larger range of unsupervised tasks in which labeled data does not exist or is too expensive to obtain they also reduce the load required for a deep neural network because the two networks share the burden expect to see more business applications such as cyber detection employ ganswhat it is the biggest challenge in machine learning deep learning in particular is the availability of large volumes of labeled data to train the system two broad techniques can help address this 1 synthesizing new data and 2 transferring a model trained for one task or domain to another techniques such as transfer learning transferring the insights learned from one taskdomain to another or oneshot learning transfer learning taken to the extreme with learning occurring with just one or no relevant examples—making them “lean data” learning techniques similarly synthesizing new data through simulations or interpolations helps obtain more data thereby augmenting existing data to improve learningwhy it matters using these techniques we can address a wider variety of problems especially those with less historical data expect to see more variations of lean and augmented data as well as different types of learning applied to a broad range of business problemswhat it is a highlevel programming language that more easily enables a developer to design probability models and then automatically “solve” these models probabilistic programming languages make it possible to reuse model libraries support interactive modeling and formal verification and provide the abstraction layer necessary to foster generic efficient inference in universal model classeswhy it matters probabilistic programming languages have the ability to accommodate the uncertain and incomplete information that is so common in the business domain we will see wider adoption of these languages and expect them to also be applied to deep learningwhat it is different types of deep neural networks such as gans or drl have shown great promise in terms of their performance and widespread application with different types of data however deep learning models do not model uncertainty the way bayesian or probabilistic approaches do hybrid learning models combine the two approaches to leverage the strengths of each some examples of hybrid models are bayesian deep learning bayesian gans and bayesian conditional ganswhy it matters hybrid learning models make it possible to expand the variety of business problems to include deep learning with uncertainty this can help us achieve better performance and explainability of models which in turn could encourage more widespread adoption expect to see more deep learning methods gain bayesian equivalents while a combination of probabilistic programming languages start to incorporate deep learningwhat it is developing machine learning models requires a timeconsuming and expertdriven workflow which includes data preparation feature selection model or technique selection training and tuning automl aims to automate this workflow using a number of different statistical and deep learning techniqueswhy it matters automl is part of what’s seen as a democratization of ai tools enabling business users to develop machine learning models without a deep programming background it will also speed up the time it takes data scientists to create models expect to see more commercial automl packages and integration of automl within larger machine learning platformswhat it is a digital twin is a virtual model used to facilitate detailed analysis and monitoring of physical or psychological systems the concept of the digital twin originated in the industrial world where it has been used widely to analyze and monitor things like windmill farms or industrial systems now using agentbased modeling computational models for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents and system dynamics a computeraided approach to policy analysis and design digital twins are being applied to nonphysical objects and processes including predicting customer behaviorwhy it matters digital twins can help spur the development and broader adopting of the internet of things iot providing a way to predictively diagnosis and maintain iot systems going forward expect to see greater use of digital twins in both physical systems and consumer choice modelingwhat it is today there are scores of machine learning algorithms in use that sense think and act in a variety of different applications yet many of these algorithms are considered “black boxes” offering little if any insight into how they reached their outcome explainable ai is a movement to develop machine learning techniques that produce more explainable models while maintaining prediction accuracywhy it matters ai that is explainable provable and transparent will be critical to establishing trust in the technology and will encourage wider adoption of machine learning techniques enterprises will adopt explainable ai as a requirement or best practice before embarking on widespread deployment of ai
