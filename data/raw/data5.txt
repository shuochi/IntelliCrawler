of computer science devoted to developing programs that enable computers to display behavior that can broadly be characterized as intelligent1 most research in ai is devoted to fairly narrow applications such as planning or speechtospeech translation in limited well defined task domains but substantial interest remains in the longrange goal of building generally intelligent autonomous agents2 even if the goal of fully humanlike intelligence is elusive and is seldom pursued explicitly and as suchthroughout its relatively short history ai has been heavily influenced by logical ideas ai has drawn on many research methodologies the value and relative importance of logical formalisms is questioned by some leading practitioners and has been debated in the literature from time to time3 but most members of the ai community would agree that logic has an important role to play in at least some central areas of ai research and an influential minority considers logic to be the most important factor in enabling strategic fundamental advancesthe relations between ai and philosophical logic are part of a larger story it is hard to find a major philosophical theme that doesn’t become entangled with issues having to do with reasoning implicatures for instance have to correspond to inferences that can be carried out by a rational interpreter of discourse whatever causality is causal relations should be inferrable in everyday common sense settings whatever belief is it should be possible for rational agents to make plausible inferences about the beliefs of other agents the goals and standing constraints that inform a rational agent’s behavior must permit the formation of reasonable plansin each of these cases compatibility with an acceptable account of the relevant reasoning is essential for a successful philosophical theory but the methods in the contemporary philosophical inventory are too crude to provide anything like an adequate account of reasoning that is this complex and this entangled in broad world knowledgebringing an eclectic set of conceptual tools to the problem of idealized reasoning in realistic settings and using computers to model and test the theories research in ai has transformed the study of reasoning—especially of practical common sense reasoning this process and its outcome is well documented in russell norvig 2010the new insights and theories that have emerged from ai are of great potential value in informing and constraining many areas of philosophical inquiry the special case of philosophical logic that forms the theme of this article may provide support for the more general point although logic in ai grew out of philosophical logic in its new setting it has produced new theories and ambitious programs that would not have been possible outside of a community devoted to building fullscale computational models of rational agencythis entry assumes an audience consisting primarily of philosophers who have little or no familiarity with ai the entry concentrates on the issues that arise when logic is used in understanding problems in intelligent reasoning and guiding the design of mechanized reasoning systems logic in ai is by now a very large and not very well demarcated field—nothing like complete coverage has been achieved here sections 3 and section 4 provide an overview with some historical and technical details concerning nonmonotonic logic and reasoning about action and change a topic that is not only central in ai but that should be of considerable interest to philosophers the remaining sections provide brief and more or less inadequate sketches of selected topics with references to the primary literatureminker 2000b is a comprehensive collection of survey papers and original contributions to the field of logicbased ai with extensive references to the literature jack minker’s introduction minker 2000a is a useful orientation to the field this volume is a good beginning point for readers who wish to pursue this topic further brachman levesque 2004a provides an introduction to the field of knowledge representation in textbook form davis 1991a and mueller 2006a are booklength treatments of the challenging problem of formalizing commonsense reasoning antonelli 2012a is a good entry point for readers interested in nonmonotonic logic and shanahan 2009a is a useful discussion of the frame problem wooldridge 2000a deals with logical formalizations of rational agentscontents of this entrytheoretical computer science developed out of logic the theory of computation if this is to be considered a different subject from logic and some related areas of mathematics4 so theoretically minded computer scientists are well informed about logic even when they aren’t logicians computer scientists in general are familiar with the idea that logic provides techniques for analyzing the inferential properties of languages and with the distinction between a highlevel logical analysis of a reasoning problem and its implementations logic for instance can provide a specification for a programming language by characterizing a mapping from programs to the computations that they license a compiler that implements the language can be incomplete or even unsound as long as in some sense it approximates the logical specification this makes it possible for the involvement of logic in ai applications to vary from relatively weak uses in which the logic informs the implementation process with analytic insights to strong uses in which the implementation algorithm can be shown to be sound and complete in some cases a working system is inspired by ideas from logic and then acquires features that at first seem logically problematic but can later be explained by developing new ideas in logical theory this sort of thing has happened for instance in logic programmingin particular logical theories in ai are independent from implementations they can be used to provide insights into the reasoning problem without directly informing the implementation direct implementations of ideas from logic—theoremproving and modelconstruction techniques—are used in ai but the ai theorists who rely on logic to model their problem areas are free to use other implementation techniques as well thus in moore 1995b chapter 1 robert c moore distinguishes three uses of logic in ai as a tool of analysis as a basis for knowledge representation and as a programming languagea large part of the effort of developing limitedobjective reasoning systems goes into the management of large complex bodies of declarative information it is generally recognized in ai that it is important to treat the representation of this information and the reasoning that goes along with it as a separate task with its own research problemsthe evolution of expert systems illustrates the point the earliest expert systems such as mycin a program that reasons about bacterial infections see buchanan shortliffe 1984 were based entirely on large systems of procedural rules with no separate representation of the background knowledge—for instance the taxonomy of the infectious organisms about which the system reasoned was not representedlater generation expert systems show a greater modularity in their design a separate knowledge representation component is useful for software engineering purposes—it is much better to have a single representation of a general fact that can have many different uses since this makes the system easier to develop and to modify and this design turns out to be essential in enabling these systems to deliver explanations as well as mere conclusions5in response to the need to design this declarative component a subfield of ai known as knowledge representation emerged during the 1980s knowledge representation deals primarily with the representational and reasoning challenges of this separate component the best place to get a feel for this subject is the proceedings of the meetings that are now held every other year see brachman et al 1989 allen et al 1991 nebel et al 1992 doyle et al 1994 aiello et al 1996 cohn et al 1998 cohn et al 2000 fensel et al 2002 dubois et al 2004 doherty et al 2006 brewka lang 2008 lin et al 2010 eiter et al 2012 baral et al 2012 and baral et al 2016typical articles in the proceedings of the kr and reasoning conferences deal with the following topicsthese topics hardly overlap at all with the contents of the journal of symbolic logic the principal research archive for mathematical logic but there is substantial overlap in theoretical emphasis with the journal of philosophical logic where topics such as tense logic epistemic logic logical approaches to practical reasoning belief change and vagueness account for a large percentage of the contributions very few jpl publications however deal with complexity theory or with potential applications to automated reasoninga history of philosophical logic is yet to be written though philosophical logic has traditionally been distinguised from mathematical logic the distinction may well be incidental in relation to the overall goals of the subject since technical rigor and the use of mathematical methods seem to be essential in all areas of logical research however the distinction between the two subfields has been magnified by differences in the sorts of professional training that are available to logicians and by the views of individuals on what is important for the fieldthe statement of policy presented in journal of symbolic logic 1936 volume 1 no 1 lists bringing together the mathematicians and philosophers working in logic among the goals of the new journal probably at this time both the mathematicians and the philosophers shared a sense that their subject was considered to be somewhat marginal by their colleagues and may have felt a primary loyalty to logic as a subject rather than to any academic discipline articles in the first volume of the jsl were divided about equally between professional mathematicians and philosophers and the early volumes of the jsl do not show any strong differences between the two groups as to topicthis situation changed in the 1960s the 1969 volume of the jsl contained 39 articles by mathematicians and only nine by philosophers by the early 1970s many philosophers felt that philosophical papers on logic were unlikely to be accepted by the jsl and that if they were accepted they were unlikely to be read by philosophers at this point the goals of the two groups had diverged considerably mathematicians were pursuing the development of an increasingly technical and complex body of methods and theorems many philosophers felt that this pursuit was increasingly irrelevant to the goal of illuminating philosophical issues these divisions led to the founding of the journal of philosophical logic in 1972 the list of sample topics in the first issue includedmost of the articles over the subsequent 28 years of the jpl belong to the first of these four categories but the description with which this list begins is not particularly illuminating why should these particular topics be of interest to philosophers their most important shared feature is a sense that despite successes in formalizing areas of mathematical logic the scope of logic remained severely limited there are unsolved problems in formalizing the nonmathematical sciences that seem to require thinking through new and different logical issues quantum logic and the logic of induction for instance the remaining topics cover a part at least of the even more pressing problems involved in extending logical theory to nonscientific reasoning the dominant goal then of philosophical logic is the extension of logical methods to nonmathematical reasoning domains this goal has a theoretical dimension if as many philosophical logicians seem to feel it requires reworking and extending logical formalismsthe development and testing of applications such as the problem of formalizing the reasoning involved in getting to the airport posed as a challenge in mccarthy 1959 see section 22 below doesn’t even appear as a category in the list of jpl topics and in fact most of the philosophical logic literature is theoretical in nature and is tested using philosophical techniques essentially this means that the theories are motivated and tested with smallscale artificial examples selected by the theoreticians these examples usually serve more as demonstrations or illustrations than as teststhe rough comparison in section 12 of the contents of the main publications for research in logical ai and philosophical logic suggests the following picture theoretical work in logical ai and in philosophical logic overlap to a large extent both are interested in developing nonmetamathematical applications of logic and the core topics are very similar this overlap is due not only to commonality of interest but to direct influence of philosophical logic on logical ai there is ample evidence as we will see that the first generation at least of ai logicists read and were influenced by the literature in philosophical logicsince that point the specialties have diverged new logical theories have emerged in logical ai nonmonotonic logic is the most important example which are not widely known in philosophical logic other differences are due to the ai community’s interest in the theoretical analysis of algorithms and of course with their sense of the importance of implementations some have to do with the emerging development in computer science of ambitious applications using unprecedentedly large bodies of logical axioms the sheer size of these applications produces new problems and new methodologies and other differences originate in the interest of philosophical logicians in some topics metaphysical topics for instance that are primarily inspired by purely philosophical considerationsconcern for applications can be a great influence on how research is carried out and presented the tradition in philosophical logic predates applications in automated reasoning and to this day remains relatively uninterested in such applications the methodology depends on intuitions but without any generally accepted methodology for articulating and deploying these intuitions and the ideas are illustrated and informed by artificial smallscale examples6 in general the philosophical literature does not deal with implementability or efficiency of the reasoning or indeed with any features of the reasoning process and it is hard to find cases in which the philosophical theories are illustrated or tested with realistic largescale reasoning problemsthese differences however are much more a matter of style than of substance or of strategic research goals it is difficult to think through the details of the reasoning process without the computational tools to make the process concrete and difficult to develop largescale formalizations of reasoning problems without computational tools for entering testing and maintaining the formalizations because the core theoretical topics modal conditional and temporal logic belief revision and the logic of context are so similar and because the ultimate goal the formalization of nonmathematical reasoning is the same one can see logic in ai as a continuous extension of the philosophical logic traditionthe early influence of philosophical logic on logic in ai was profound the bibliography of mccarthy hayes 1969 one of the most influential early papers in logical ai illustrates the point well there are 58 citations in the bibliography of these 35 refer to the philosophical logic literature there are 17 computer science citations one mathematical logic citation one economics citation and one psychology citation this paper was written at a time when there were hardly any references to logical ai in the computer science literature naturally as logical ai has matured and developed as a branch of computer science the proportion of crossdisciplinary citations has decreased a sampling of articles from the first knowledge representation conference brachman et al 1989 held in 1989 shows only 12 philosophical logic citations out of a total of 522 sampled citations a sampling of articles from cohn et al 1998 held in 1998 shows 23 philosophical logic citations out of a total of 468 sampled7despite the dramatic decrease in quantity of explicit citations the contemporary literature in logical ai reflects an indirect acquaintance with the earlier literature in philosophical logic since many of the computational papers that are explicitly cited in the modern works were influenced by this literature of course the influence becomes increasingly distant as time passes and this trend is accelerated by the fact that new theoretical topics have been invented in logical ai that were at best only dimly prefigured in the philosophical literaturealthough philosophical logic is now a relatively small field in comparison to logical ai it remains a viable area of research with new work appearing regularly but references to contemporary research in philosophical logic are rare in the ai literature similarly the papers currently published in the journal of philosophical logic at least do not show much influence from ai8 in europe the lines are harder to draw between professional divisions among logicians some european journals especially the journal of logic language and information are successful in maintaining a focus in logic while attracting authors from all the disciplines in which logic is representedthe importance of applications in logical ai and the scale of these applications represents a new methodology for logic—one that would have been impossible without mechanized reasoning this methodology forces theoreticians to think through problems on a new scale and at a new level of detail and this in turn has a profound effect on the resulting theories the effects of this methodology will be illustrated in the sections below dealing with various topics in logical ai but the point is illustrated well by reasoning about action and change this topic was investigated in the philosophical literature reasoning about change at least is part of tense logic and the consequences of action are investigated in the literature on “seeing to it that” see for instance belnap 1996 the latter theory has no very robust account of action the central construct is a variation on a branchingtime modality of the sort that has been familiar since prior 1967 although it represents an interesting development in philosophical logic the scale of the accomplishment is very different from the research tradition in logical ai reported in section 4 below the formalisms in this tradition not only support the formalization of complex realistic planning problems but provide entirely new insights into reasoning about the causal effects of actions the persistence of states and the interactions between actions and continuous physical processes developments such as this would have been impossible without the interactions between the logical theories and largescale practical applications in automated planningin carnap 1955 rudolf carnap attempted to clarify intensional analyses of linguistic meaning and to justify from a methodological point of view by imagining how the analysis could be applied to the linguistic usage of a hypothetical robot carnap hoped that the fact that we could imagine ourselves to know the internal structure of the robot would help to make the case for an empirical science of semantics more plausible this hope proved to be unjustified the philosophical issue that concerned carnap remains controversial to this day and thought experiments with robots have not proved to be particularly rewarding in addressing it real robots though with real applications9 are a very different matter though it is hard to tell whether they will prove to be helpful in clarifying fundamental philosophical problems they provide a laboratory for logic that is revolutionary in its potential impact on the subject they motivate the development of entirely new logical theories that should prove to be as important for philosophy as the fundamental developments in logic of the late nineteenth century proved to bethe emergence of separate mathematical and philosophical subspecialties within logic was not an entirely healthy thing for the field the process of making mathematical logic rigorous and of demonstrating the usefulness of the techniques in achieving mathematical ends that was pursued so successfully in the first half of the twentieth century represents a coherent refinement of logical methodology all logicians should be pleased and proud that logic is now an area with a body of results and problems that is as substantial and challenging as those associated with most areas of mathematicsbut these methodological advances were gained at the expense of coverage in the final analysis logic deals with reasoning—and relatively little of the reasoning we do is mathematical while almost all of the mathematical reasoning that nonmathematicians do is mere calculation to have both rigor and scope logic needs to keep its mathematical and its philosophical side united in a single discipline in recent years neither the mathematical nor the philosophical professions—and this is especially true in the united states—have done a great deal to promote this unity but the needs of computer science provide strong unifying motives the professional standards for logical research in computer science certainly require rigor but the field also puts its practitioners into contact with reasoning domains that are not strictly mathematical and creates needs for innovative logical theorizingthe most innovative and ambitious area of computer science in terms of its coverage of reasoning and the one that is closest in spirit to philosophical logic is ai this article will attempt to provide an introduction for outsiders who are familiar with logic to the aspects of ai that are closest to the philosophical logic tradition this area of logic deserves and urgently needs to be studied by historians but such a study will not be found herethe most influential figure in logical ai is john mccarthy mccarthy was one of the founders of ai and consistently advocated a research methodology that uses logical techniques to formalize the reasoning problems that ai needs to solve all but the most recent work in mccarthy’s research program can be found in lifschitz 1990a which also contains an introduction to mccarthy’s work lifschitz 1990b for additional historical background see israel 1991mccarthy’s methodological position has not changed substantially since it was first articulated in mccarthy 1959 and elaborated and amended in mccarthy hayes 1969 the motivation for using logic is that—even if the eventual implementations do not directly and simply use logical reasoning techniques like theorem proving—a logical formalization helps us to understand the reasoning problem itself the claim is that without an understanding of what the reasoning problems are it will not be possible to implement their solutions plausible as this platonic argument may seem it is in fact controversial in the context of ai an alternative methodology would seek to learn or evolve the desired behaviors the representations and reasoning that this methodology would produce might well be too complex to characterize or to understand at a conceptual levelfrom mccarthy hayes 1969 it is clear that mccarthy thought of his methodology for ai as overlapping to a large extent with traditional philosophy but adding to it the need to inform the design of programs capable of manifesting general intelligence this idea is not uncongenial to some philosophers see for instance carnap 1956 pp 244–247 and pollock 1995 in practice the actual theories that have emerged from mccarthy’s methodology are influenced most strongly by work in philosophical logic and the research tradition in logical ai represents a more or less direct development of this work with some changes in emphasis this review will concentrate on logical ai in relation to philosophical logic without further comment on relations to philosophy in general or to the feasibility of developing humanlevel intelligent systemsmccarthy’s longterm objective was to formalize common sense reasoning the prescientific reasoning that is used in dealing with everyday problems an early example of such a problem mentioned in mccarthy 1959 is getting from home to the airport other examples includestated baldly the goal of formalizing common sense would probably seem outrageous to most philosophers who are trained to think of common sense as rather elusive but whether or not the ultimate goal is appropriate and achievable the specific formalization projects that have emerged from this program have been successful in several ways they have succeeded in breaking new territory for logic by extending the scope of the reasoning problems to which logical techniques can be successfully applied they have demonstrated that logical techniques can contribute usefully to the solution of specific ai problems—planning is the most successful of these but some success has been achieved in other areas as well11 they form the basis of one approach to developing complete autonomous agents12 and they have illuminated many specific forms of nonscientific reasoning—for instance qualitative reasoning about the behavior of physical devices13although mccarthy has advocated this program of formalization since 1959—an almost prehistorical date for ai—the program has not been taken on board and pursued by a dedicated community until recently research in this area has gained much momentum since 1990 for further discussion and details see section 8aristotle believed that most reasoning including reasoning about what to do and about sublunary natural phenomena dealt with things that hold “always or for the most part” but aristotelian logic deals only with patterns of inference that hold without exception we find at the very beginning of logic a discrepancy between the scope of logical theory and common sense reasoning nonmonotonic logic is the first sustained attempt within logical theory to remedy this discrepancy as such it represents a potential for a sweeping expansion of the scope of logic as well as a significant body of technical resultsthe consequence relations of classical logics are monotonic that is if a set γ of formulas implies a consequence c then a larger set γ ∪ a will also imply c a logic is nonmonotonic if its consequence relation lacks this property preferred models provide a general way to induce a nonmonotonic consequence relation invoke a function that for each γ produces a subset mγ of the models of γ in general we will expect mγ to be a proper subset of these models we then say that γ implies c if c is satisfied by every model in mγ as long as we do not suppose that mγ∪a ⊆ mγ we can easily have an implication relation between γ and c without imposing this relation on supersets of γ14this model theoretic behavior corresponds to expectationguided reasoning where the expectations allow certain cases to be neglected here is an important difference between common sense and mathematics mathematicians are trained to reject a proof by cases unless the cases exhaust all the possibilities but typical instances of common sense reasoning neglect some alternatives in fact it is reasonable to routinely ignore improbable possibilities standing in a kitchen in california wondering if there is time to wash the dishes before leaving for work one might not take the possibility of an earthquake into accountthere seem to be many legitimate reasons for neglecting certain cases in common sense reasoning a qualitative judgment that the probability of a case is negligible is one reason but for instance in a planning context it may be reasonable to ignore even nonnegligible probabilities as long as there is no practical point in planning on these casesthe motivations for nonmonotonicity seem to involve a number of complex factors probability perhaps in some qualitative sense normality expectations that are reasonable in the sense that one can’t be reasonably blamed for having them mutual acceptance and factors having to do with limited rationality it may well be that no one has succeeded in disentangling and clarifying these motivating considerations in the early stages of its emergence in logical ai many researchers seem to have thought of nonmonotonic reasoning as a general method for reasoning about uncertainty but by the end of the 1980s implementations of fully quantitative probabilistic reasoning were not only possible in principle but were clearly preferable in many sorts of applications to methods involving nonmonotonic logic a plausible and realistic rationale for nonmonotonic logic has to fit it into a broader picture of reasoning about uncertainty that also includes probabilistic reasoning15three influential papers on nonmonotonic logic appeared in 1980 mcdermott doyle 1980 reiter 1980 and mccarthy 1980 in each case the formalisms presented in these papers were the result of a gestation period of several years or more to set out the historical influences accurately it would be necessary to interview the authors and this has not been done however there seem to have been two motivating factors strategic considerations having to do with the longrange goals of ai and much more specific tactical considerations arising from the analysis of the reasoning systems that were being deployed in the 1970ssection 22 drew attention to mccarthy’s proposed goal of formalizing common sense reasoning the brief discussion above in section 31 suggests that monotonicity may be an obstacle in pursuing this goal an additional motive was found in minsky 1974 which was widely read at the time this paper presents an assortment of challenges for ai focusing at the outset on the problem of natural language understanding16 minsky advocates framebased knowledge representation techniques17 and conceiving of the use of these representations as an alternative to logic he throws out a number of loosely connected challenges for the logical approach including the problem of building largescale representations of reasoning efficiently of representing control knowledge and of providing for the flexible revision of defeasible beliefs in retrospect most ai researchers would tend to agree that these problems are general challenges to any research program in ai including the one minsky himself advocated at the time and that logical techniques are an important element in addressing some perhaps all of the issues for instance a well structured logical design can be a great help in scaling up knowledge representationminsky apparently intended to provide general arguments against logical methods in ai but mcdermott doyle 1980 and mccarthy 1980 interpret minsky 1974 as a challenge that can be met by developing logics that lack the monotonicity property perhaps unintentionally the paper seems to have provided some incentive to the nonmonotonic logicians by stressing monotonicity as a source of the alleged shortcomings of logic in fact the term ‘monotonicity’ apparently makes its first appearance in print in minsky’s 1974 paperthe development of nonmonotonic logic also owes a great deal to the applied side of ai in fact the need for a nonmonotonic analysis of a number of ai applications was as persuasive as the strategic considerations urged by mccarthy and in many ways more influential on the shape of the formalisms that emerged here we mention three such applications that appear to have been important for some of the early nonmonotonic logicians belief revision closedworld reasoning and planningin a tms part of the support for a belief can consist in the absence of some other belief this introduces nonmonotonicity for instance it provides for defaults that wednesday is the default day for scheduling a meeting means the belief that the meeting will be on wednesday depends on the absence of specialcase beliefs entailing that it will not be on wednesdaythe tms algorithm and its refinements had a significant impact on ai applications and this created the need for a logical analysis in even fairly simple cases it can be hard in the absence of analytic tools to see what consequences a tms should deliver this provided a natural and highly specific challenge for those seeking to develop a nonmonotonic logic the tms also provided specific intuitions the idea that the key to nonmonotonicity has to do with inferences based on unprovability was important for the modal approaches to nonmonotonic logic and for default logic and the tms’s emphasis on interactions between arguments began a theme in nonmonotonic logic that remains important to this day see the discussion of argumentbased approaches in section 34 belowthe study of databases belongs to computer science not specifically to ai but one of the research paradigms in the scientific analysis of databases uses logical models of the representations and reasoning see minker 1997 for a recent survey of the field and this area has interacted with logical ai the deductive database paradigm was taking shape at about the same time that many ai researchers were thinking through the problems of nonmonotonic logic and provided several specific examples of nonmonotonic reasoning that called for analyses of these perhaps the most important is the closedworld assumption according to which—at least as far as simple facts are concerned represented in the database as positive or negative literals—the system assumes that it knows all that there is to be known it is the closed world assumption that justifies a negative answer to a query “is there a direct flight from detroit to bologna” when the system finds no such flight in its data this is another case of inference from the absence of a proof a negative is proved in effect by the failure of a systematic attempt to prove the positive this idea which was investigated in papers such as reiter 1978 and clark 1978 also provided a challenge for nonmonotonic logics as well as specific intuitions—note that again the idea of inference rules depending on the absence of a proof is present hererational planning is impossible without the ability to reason about the outcomes of a series of contemplated actions predictive reasoning of this sort is local in a complex world with many features we assume that most things will be unchanged by the performance of an action but this locality has proved to be difficult to formalize the problem of how to formalize this “causal inertia”18 is known as the frame problemit is very natural to suppose that inertia holds by default variables are unchanged by the performance of an action unless there is a special reason to think that they will change this suggests that nonmonotonic temporal formalisms should provide an appropriate foundation for reasoning about action and change so attempts to formalize the reasoning needed in planning also created a need for nonmonotonic logics one of the earliest attempts to formalize nonmonotonic reasoning sandewall 1972 addresses the frame problem inertial defaults are an especially important and instructive case study no more will be said about them here since they are discussed in detail in section 44 belowthe three 1980 papers mentioned at the beginning of section 32 represent three approaches to nonmonotonic logic that remain important subfields to this day circumscription mccarthy modal approaches doyle mcdermott and default logic reiterin mccarthy 1993a mccarthy urges us when considering the early history of circumscription to take into account a group of three papers mccarthy 1986 1980 and 1987 the first paper connects the strategic ideas of mccarthy hayes 1969 with the need for a nonmonotonic logic and sketches the logical ideas of domain circumscription which is now classified as the simplest case of circumscription the second paper provides more thorough logical foundations and introduces the more general and powerful predicate circumscription approach the third paper concentrates on developing techniques for formalizing challenging common sense examplesall forms of circumscription involve restricting attention to models in which certain sets are minimized for this reason circumscription can be grouped with the preferred models approaches to nonmonotonicity see section 34 below mccarthy’s formalism is fairly conservative though it raises interesting logical issues in higherorder logic and complexity it uses familiar logical frameworks and much of the focus is on the development of formalization techniques the other varieties of nonmonotonic logic including default logic and the modal nonmonotonic logics raise issues of the sort that are familiar to philosophical logicians having to do with the design of new logics the systematic investigation of questions concerning validity and managing the proliferation of alternative logicsas the discussion above of truth maintenance indicated it is very natural to think of nonmonotonic inferences as being hedged that is a nonmonotonic inference may require not merely the presence of a set of proved conclusions but the absence of certain other conclusions the general form of such a rule isan important special case of dr is a normal default a simple rule to the effect that c holds by default conditionally on assumptions a1…an this can be formalized by taking the condition that must be absent to simply be the negation of the conclusionat first sight it is somewhat perplexing how to formalize this notion of nonmonotonic inference since it seems to require a circular definition of provability that can’t be replaced with an inductive definition as in the nonmonotonic case the difficulty with the early theory of sandewall 1972 is that it does not address this difficulty successfully mcdermott doyle 1980 and reiter 1980 use fixpoint definitions to solve the problem in both cases the logical task is 1 to develop a formalism in which rules like dr can be expressed and 2 to define the relation between a theory dt which may incorporate such rules and the theories e which could count as reasonable consequences of dt in the terminology that later became standard we need to define the relation between a theory dt and its extensionsin retrospect we can identify two sorts of approaches to nonmonotonic logic those based on preference and those based on conflict theories of the first sort like circumscription involve a relatively straightforward modification of the ordinary modeltheoretic definition of logical consequence that takes into account a preference relation over models theories of the second sort like default logic involve a more radical rethinking of logical ideas the possibility of multiple extensions—different possible coherent inferentially complete conclusion sets that can be drawn from a single set of premises—means that we have to think of logical consequence not as a function taking a set of axioms into its logical closure but as a relation between a set of axioms and alternative logical closures since logical consequence is so fundamental this represents a major theoretical departure with multiple extensions we can still retrieve a consequence relation between a theory and a formula in various ways the simplest being to say that dt nonmonotonically implies c if c is a member of every extension of dt still the conflictbased account of consequence provides a much richer underlying structure than the preferential onereiter approaches the formalization problem conservatively nonmonotonicity is not expressed in the language of default logic which is the same as the language of firstorder logic but a theory may involve a set of default rules—rules of the form dr reiter 1980 provides a fixpoint definition of the extensions of such a theory and develops the theoretical groundwork for the approach proving a number of the basic theoremsof these theorems we mention one in particular which will be used in section 45 in connection with the yale shooting anomaly the idea is to take a conjectured extension which will be a set t and to use this set for consistency checks in a prooflike process that successively applies default rules in wd to stages that begin with wwe define a default proof process t0t1… for w d relative to t as followsthat is nonvacuously applicable to ti relative to t and letin other words as long as we can nonvacuously close the stage we are working on under an applicable default we do so otherwise we do nothing a theorem of reiter’s says that under these circumstancesthus we can show that t is an extension by 1 using t for consistency checks in a default reasoning process from w d 2 taking the limit t′ of this process and 3 verifying that in fact t′ tthe modal approach represents a “higher level of nonmonotonic involvement” than default logic the unprovability construct is represented explicitly in the language by means of a modal operator l informally interpreted as ‘provable’ or as in mcdermott doyle 1980 by the dual of this operator19 although mcdermott and doyle’s terminology is different from reiter’s the logical ideas are very similar—the essence of their approach like reiter’s is a fixpoint definition of the extensions of a nonmonotonic logic incorporating nonmonoticity in the object language creates some additional complexities which in the early modal approach show up mainly in proliferation of the logics and difficulties in evaluating the merits of the alternatives as better foundations for the modal approach emerged it became possible to prove the expected theorems concerning equivalence of modal formalisms with default logic20reiter’s paper reiter 1980 appears to have developed primarily out of tactical considerations the earlier paper reiter 1978 is largely concerned with providing an account of database queries unlike the other seminal papers in nonmonotonic logic reiter’s shows specific influence from the earlier and independent work on nonmonotonicity in logic programming—the work seems to have been largely inspired by the need to provide logical foundations for the nonmonotonic reasoning found in deductive databases doyle and mcdermott’s paper shows both strategic and tactical motivation—citing the earlier literature in logicist ai it motivates nonmonotonic logic as part of a program of modeling common sense rationality but the theory is also clearly influenced by the need to provide a formal account of truth maintenancenonmonotonic logic is a complex robust research field providing a survey of the subject is made difficult by the fact that there are many different foundational paradigms for formalizing nonmonotonic reasoning and the relations between these paradigms is not simple an adequate account of even a significant part of the field requires a something like a booklength treatment a number of books are available including łukaszewicz 1990 brewka 1991 besnard 1992 marek truszczynski 1994 antoniou 1997 brewka et al 1997 schlechta 1997 antonelli 2005 makinson 2005b and horty 2012 two collections are especially useful ginsberg 1987 and gabbay et al 1994 the former is a useful source for readers interested in the early history of the subject and has an excellent introduction the handbook chapters in gabbay et al 1994 provide overviews of important topics and approaches my current recommendation for readers interested in a quick readable introduction to the topic would be brewka et al 1997 and selfselected chapters of gabbay et al 1994 some other sources include bochman 2004 makinson 2005 antoniou and wang 2007 bochman 2007 and schlechta 2007 we rely on these references for technical background and will concentrate on intellectual motivation basic ideas and potential longterm signifgicance for logicat the outset in section 31 it was mentioned how preferred models could be used to characterize a nonmonotonic consequence relation this general model theory of nonmonotonicity emerged in shoham 1988 five years after the work discussed in section 32 and represents a much more general and abstract approachpreferential semantics relies on a function s taking a set k of models into a subset sk of k the crucial definition of preferential entailment stipulates that a is a nonmonotonic consequence of γ if every model m of smodelsγ implies a shoham’s theory is based on a partial order ≼ over models sk can then be characterized as the set of models in k that are ≼minimal in k to ensure that no set can preferentially entail a contradiction unless it classically entails a contradiction infinite descending ≼ chains need to be disallowedthis treatment of nonmonotonicity is similar to the earlier modal semantic theories of conditionals—the similarities are particularly evident using the more general theories of conditional semantics such as the one presented in chellas 1975 of course the consequence relation of the classical conditional logics is monotonic and conditional semantics uses possible worlds not models but the leftnonmonotonicity of conditionals the fact that a c does not imply a ∧ b c creates issues that parallel those in nonmonotonic logics early work in nonmonotonic logic does not seem to be aware of the analogy with conditional logic but the interrelations between the two have become an important theme more recently see for instance gärdenfors makinson 1994 boutilier 1992 pearl 1994 gabbay 1995 benferat et al 1997 delgrande 1998 arlocosta shapiro 1992 alcourrón 1995 asher 1995 and thomason 2007preference semantics raises an opportunity for formulating and proving representation theorems relating conditions over preference relations to properties of the abstract consequence relation this line of investigation began with lehmann magidor 1992neither doyle or mcdermott pursued the modal approach much beyond the initial stages of mcdermott 1982 and mcdermott doyle 1980 with a helpful suggestion from robert stalnaker see stalnaker 1993 however robert c moore produced a modal theory that improves in many ways on the earlier ideas moore gives the modal operator of his system an epistemic interpretation based on the conception of a default rule as one that licenses a conclusion for a reasoning agent unless something that the agent knows blocks the conclusion in moore’s autoepistemic logic an extension e of a theory t is a superset of t that is stable ie that is deductively closed and that satisfies the following two rulesit is also usual to impose a groundedness condition on autoepistemic extensions of t ensuring that every member of an extension has some reason tracing back to t various such conditions have been considered the simplest one restricts extensions to those satisfyingautoepistemic logic remains a popular approach to nonmonotonic logic in part because of its usefulness in providing theoretical foundations for logic programming for more recent references see marek truszczynski 1991 moore 1995b marek truszczynski 1989 konolige 1994 antoniou 1997 moore 1993 and deneker et al 2003epistemic logic has inspired other approaches to nonmonotonic logic like other modal theories of nonmonotonicity these use modality to reflect consistency in the object language and so allow default rules along the lines of dr to be expressed but instead of consistency these use ignorance see halpern moses 1985 and levesque 1987 for variations on this idea these theories are explained and compared to other nonmonotonic logics in meyer van der hoek 1995 in more recent work levesque’s ideas are systematically presented and applied to the theory of knowledge bases in levesque lakemeyer 2000this brief historical introduction to nonmonotonic logic leaves untouched a number of general topics that might well be of interest to a nonspecialist these include graphbased and prooftheoretic approaches to nonmonotonic logic results that interrelate the various formalisms complexity results tractable special cases of nonmonotonic reasoning relations between nonmonotonic and abductive reasoning relations to probability logics the logical intuitions and apparent patterns of validity underlying nonmonotonic logics and the techniques used to formalize domains using nonmonotonic logics for these and other topics the reader is referred to the literature as a start the chapters in gabbay et al 1994 are highly recommendedtime and temporal reasoning have been associated with logic since the origins of scientific logic with aristotle the idea of a logic of tense in the modern sense has been familiar since at least the work of jan łukasiewicz see for instance łukasiewicz 1970 but the shape of what is commonly known as tense logic was standardized by arthur prior’s work in the 1950s and 1960s see prior 1956 1967 196822 as the topic was developed in philosophical logic tense logic proved to be a species of modal logic prior’s work was heavily influenced by both hintikka and kripke and by the idea that the truth of tenselogical formulas is relative to worldstates or temporal stages of the world these are the tensetheoretic analogues of the timeless possible worlds of ordinary modal logic thus the central logical problems and techniques of tense logic were borrowed from modal logic for instance it became a research theme to work out the relations between axiomatic systems and the corresponding model theoretic constraints on temporal orderings see for instance burgess 1984 and van benthem 1983priorian tense logic shares with modal logic a technical concentration on issues that arise from using the firstorder theory of relations to explain the logical phenomena an expectation that the important temporal operators will be quantifiers over worldstates and a rather remote and foundational approach to actual specimens of temporal reasoning of course these temporal logics do yield validities such asif a then it was the case that a was going to be the case which certainly are intuitively valid but at most these can only play a broadly foundational role in accounting for realistic reasoning about time it is hard to think of realistic examples in which they play a leading partthis characteristic of course is one that modal logic shares with most traditional and modern logical theories the connection with everyday reasoning is rather weak although modern logical techniques do account with some success for the reasoning involved in verifying mathematical proofs and logic puzzles they do not explain other cases of technical or common sense reasoning with much detail or plausibility even in cases like legal reasoning where logicians and logicallyminded legal theorists have put much effort into formalizing the reasoning the utility of the results is controversialplanning problems provide one of the most fruitful showcases for combining logical analysis with ai applications on the one hand there are many practically important applications of automated planning and on the other logical formalizations of planning are genuinely helpful in understanding the problems and in designing algorithmsthe classical representation of an ai planning problem as described in amarel 1968 evidently originates in early work of herbert simon’s published in a 1966 cmu technical report simon 1966 in such a problem an agent in an initial worldstate is equipped with a set of actions which are thought of as partial functions transforming worldstates into worldstates actions are feasible only in worldstates that meet certain constraints these constraints are now called the “preconditions” of the action a planning problem then becomes a search for a series of feasible actions that successively transform the initial worldstate into a desired worldstatethe situation calculus developed by john mccarthy is the origin of most of the later work in formalizing reasoning about action and change it was first described in 1969 in mccarthy 1983 the earliest generally accessible publication on the topic is mccarthy hayes 1969apparently priorian tense logic had no influence on amarel 1968 but there is no important difference between amarel’s worldstates and those of priorian tense logic the “situations” of the situation calculus are these same worldstates under a new name23 they resemble possible worlds in modal logic in providing abstract locations that support a consistent and complete collection of truths as in tense logic these locations are ordered and change is represented by the variation in truths from one location to another the crucial difference between the situation calculus and tense logic is that change in the situation is dynamic—changes do not merely occur but occur for a reasonthis difference of course is inspired by the intended use of the situation calculus it is meant to formalize simon’s representation of the planning problem in which a single agent reasons about the scenarios in which a series of actions is performed24 in this model what drives change is the performance of actions so the fundamental model theoretic relation is the relationbetween an action a an initial situation s in which a is performed and a resulting situation s′ immediately subsequent to the performance of the action usually though this is not absolutely necessary the deterministic assumption is made that s′ is unique in general actions can be successfully performed only under certain limited circumstances this could be modeled by allowing for cases in which there is no s′ such that resultass′ but usually it is assumed that result is in fact a total function but that in cases in which s does not meet the “preconditions” of a there are no restrictions on the s′ satisfying resultass′ so that the causal effects of a will be entirely unconstrained in such casesa planning problem starts with a limited repertoire of actions where sets of preconditions and effects are associated with each action an initial situation and a goal which can be treated as a formula a planning problem is a matter of finding a sequence of actions that will achieve the goal given the initial situation that is given a goal g and initial situation s the problem will consist of finding a sequence s1sn of actions which will transform s into a final situation that satisfies g this means assuming that result is a function that g will be satisfied by the situation sn where s0 s and si1 is the s′ such that resultai1sis′ the planning problem is in effect a search for a sequence of actions meeting these conditions the success conditions for the search can be characterized in a formalism like the situation calculus which allows information about the results of actions to be expressednothing has been said up till now about the actual language of the situation calculus the crucial thing is how change is to be expressed with tense logic in mind it would be natural to invoke a modality like aa with the truth conditionthis formalization in the style of dynamic logic is in fact a leading candidate see section 47 belowbut mccarthy hayes 1969 deploys a language that is much closer to firstorder logic this formalization style is characteristic of mccarthy’s work see mccarthy 1979 actions are treated as individuals and certain propositions whose truth values can change over time propositional fluents are also treated as individuals where s is a situation and f is a fluent holdsfs says that f is true in ssince the pioneering work of the nineteenth and early twentieth century logicians the process of formalizing mathematical domains has largely become a matter of routine although as with set theory there may be controversies about what axioms and logical infrastructure best serve to formalize an area of mathematics the methods of formalization and the criteria for evaluating them are relatively unproblematic this methodological clarity has not been successfully extended to other domains even the formalization of the empirical sciences presents difficult problems that have not yet been resolved25the formalization of temporal reasoning and in particular of reasoning about actions and plans is the bestdeveloped successful extension of modern formalization techniques to domains other than mathematical theories this departure has required the creation of new methodologies one methodological innovation will emerge in section 45 the development of a library of scenarios for testing the adequacy of various formalisms and the creation of specialized domains like the blocksworld domain mentioned above in section 42 that serve a laboratories for testing ideas for more on the blocks world see genesereth nilsson 1987 davis 1991 mccarthy’s ideas about elaboration tolerance mccarthy 1999 provide one interesting attempt to provide a criterion for the adequacy of formalizations another idea that has emerged in the course of formalizing common sense domains is the importance of an explicit ontology see for instance fikes 1996 and lenat guha 1989 another is the potential usefulness of explicit representations of context see guha 1991 another is the use of simulation techniques see for instance johnstone williamson 2007to tell whether a plan achieves its goal you need to see whether the goal holds in the plan’s final state doing this requires predictive reasoning a type of reasoning that was neglected in the tenselogical literature as in mechanics prediction involves the inference of later states from earlier ones but in the case of simple planning problems at least the dynamics are determined by actions rather than by differential equations the investigation of this qualitative form of temporal reasoning and of related sorts of reasoning eg plan recognition which seeks to infer goals from observed actions and narrative explanation which seeks to fill in implicit information in a temporal narrative is one of the most impressive chapters in the brief history of common sense logicismthe essence of prediction is the problem of inferring what holds in the situation that ensues from performing an action given information about the initial situation it is often assumed that the agent has complete knowledge about the initial situation—this assumption is usual in classical formalizations of planning26a large part of the qualitative dynamics that is needed for planning consists in inferring what does not change take a simple plan to type the word ‘cat’ using word processing software the natural plan is to first enter ‘c’ then enter ‘a’ then enter ‘t’ part of one’s confidence in this plan is that the actions are independent for instance entering ‘a’ does not also erase the ‘c’ the required inference can be thought of as a form of inertia the frame problem is the problem of how to formalize the required inertial reasoningthe frame problem was named and introduced in mccarthy hayes 1969 unlike most of the philosophically interesting technical problems to emerge in ai it has attracted the interest of philosophers most of the relevant papers and background information can be found in ford pylyshyn 1996 pylyshyn 1987 both of these volumes document interactions between ai and philosophythe quality of these interactions is discouraging like any realistic common sense reasoning problem the frame problem is openended and can depend on a wide variety of circumstances if you put 20 in a wallet put the wallet in your pocket and go to the store you can safely assume that the 20 is still in the wallet but if you leave the 20 on the counter at the store while shopping you can’t safely assume it will be there later this may account for the temptation that makes some philosophers27 want to construe the frame problem very broadly so that very soon it becomes indiscernible from the problem of formalizing general common sense in arbitrary domains such a broad construal may serve to introduce speculative discussions concerning the nature of ai but it loses all contact with the genuine new logical problems in temporal reasoning that have been discovered by the ai community it provides a forum for repeating some familiar philosophical themes but it brings nothing new to philosophy this way of interpreting the frame problem is disappointing because philosophy can use all the help it can get the ai community has succeeded in extending and enriching the application of logic to common sense reasoning in dramatic ways that are highly relevant to philosophy the clearest account of these developments to be found in the volumes edited by pylyshyn is morgenstern 1996 an extended treatment can be found in shanahan 1997 also see sandewall 1994 and shanahan 2009the purely logical frame problem can be solved using monotonic logic by simply writing explicit axioms stating what does not change when an action is performed this technique can be successfully applied to quite complex formalization problems28 but nonmonotonic solutions to the framework have been extensively investigated and deployed these lead to new and interesting lines of logical developmentsome philosophers fodor 1987 lormand 1996 have felt that contrived propositions will pose special difficulties in connection with the frame problem as shanahan points out shanahan 1997 p 24 fodor’s “fridgeon” example is readily formalized in the situation calculus and poses no special problems however as lormand suggests goodman’s examples goodman 1946 do create problems if they are admitted as fluents there will be anomalous extensions in which objects change from green to blue in order to preserve their gruenessthis is one of the few points about the frame problem made by a philosopher that raises a genuine difficulty for the formal solutions but the difficulty is peripheral since the example is not realistic recall that fluents are represented as firstorder individuals although fluents are situationdependent functions an axiom of comprehension is certainly not assumed for fluents in fact it is generally supposed that the domain of fluents will be a very limited set of the totality of situationdependent functions typically it will be a relatively small finite set of variables representing features of the domain considered to be important in particular cases these will be chosen in much the same way that a set of variables is chosen in statistical modelingthere doesn’t seem to be a systematic account in the ai literature of how to choose an appropriate set of fluents but it would certainly be part of such an account that all fluents should correspond to projectable predicates in goodman’s sensethe idea behind nonmonotonic solutions to the frame problem is to treat inertia as a default changes are assumed to occur only if there is some special reason for them to occur in an actioncentered account of change this means that absence of change is assumed when an action is performed unless a reason for the change can be found in axioms for the actionfor explicitness let’s use reiter’s default logic to illustrate the formalization recall that in reiter’s theory defaults are represented as rules not formulas so that they are not subject to quantification to formalize inertia then we need to use default rule schemata for each fluent f action a and situation s the set of these schemata will include an instance of the following schemathis way of doing things makes any case in which a fluent changes truth value a prima facie anomaly but it follows from reiter’s account of extensions that such defaults are overridden when they conflict with the monotonic theory of situation dynamics so if for instance there is a monotonic causal axiom for the action blacken ensuring that blackening a block will make it black in the resulting situation then the appropriate instance of ir will be inefficacious and there will be no extension in which a white block remains white when it is blackenedthe frame problem somehow managed to capture the attention of a wide community—but if one is interested in understanding the complex problems that arise in generalizing formalisms like the situation calculus while at the same time ensuring that they deliver plausible solutions to a wide variety of scenarios it is more useful to consider a larger range of problems for the ai community the larger problems include the frame problem itself the qualification problem the ramification problem generalizability along a number of important dimensions including incomplete information concurrency multiple agents and continuous change and finally a large assortment of specific challenges such as the scenarios mentioned later in this sectionthe qualification problem arises generally in connection with the formalization of common sense generalizations typically these involve exceptions and these exceptions—especially if one is willing to entertain farfetched circumstances—can iterate endlessly the same phenomenon under a label like ‘the problem of ceteris paribus generalizations’ is familiar from analytic philosophy it also comes up in the semantics of generic constructions found in natural languages29 in a sense this problem is addressed at a general level by nonmonotonic logics which—though they do not provide a way to enumerate exceptions—do allow common sense generalizations to be formulated as defaults as well as enabling further qualifications to be added nondestructively ideally then the initial generalization can be stated as an axiom and qualifications can be added incrementally in the form of further axiomsthe qualification problem was raised in mccarthy 1986 where it was motivated chiefly by generalizations concerning the consequences of actions mccarthy considers in some detail the generalization that turning the ignition key in an automobile will start the car much the same point in fact can be made about virtually any action including stacking one block on another—the standard action that is used to illustrate the situation calculus a circumscriptive approach to the qualification problem is presented in lifschitz 1987 this explicitly introduces the precondition relation between an action and its preconditions into the formalism and circumscriptively minimizes preconditions eliminating from preferred models any “unknown preconditions” that might render an action inefficaciousseveral dimensions of the qualification problem remain as broad challenging research problems for one thing not every nonmonotonic logic provides graceful mechanisms for qualification default logic for instance does not deliver the intuitively desired conclusions suppose one formalizes the common sense generalization that if you press the ‘a’ key on a computer it will type ‘a’ as a normal defaultif we then formalize the exception to this generalization that if you press the ‘a’ key while the alt key is depressed the cursor moves to the beginning of the current sentence as a normal default along the same lines we get two extensions one in which pressing ‘a’ while the alt key is depressed adds ‘a’ to the text and another in which it moves the cursorthe problem is that default logic does not provide for more specific defaults to override ones that are more general this principle of specificity has been discussed at length in the literature incorporating it in a nonmonotonic logic can complicate the theory considerably see for instance asher morreau 1991 and horty 1994 and as elkan 1995 points out the qualification problem raises computational issuesrelatively little attention has been given to the qualification problem for characterizing actions in comparison with other problems in temporal reasoning in particular the standard accounts of unsuccessful actions are somewhat unintuitive in the formalization of lifschitz 1987 for instance actions with some unsatisfied preconditions are only distinguished from actions whose preconditions all succeed in that the conventional effects of the action will only be ensured when the preconditions are met it is as if an action of spending 1000000 can be performed at any moment—although if you don’t have the money no effects in particular will be guaranteed 30 and there is no distinction between actions that cannot even be attempted like boarding a plane in london when you are in sydney actions that can be attempted but in which the attempt can be expected to go wrong like making a withdrawal when you have insufficient funds actions that can be attempted with reasonable hope of success and actions that can be attempted with guaranteed success as jl austin made clear in austin 1961 the ways in which actions can be attempted and in which attempted actions can fail are a well developed part of common sense reasoning obviously in contemplating a plan containing actions that may fail one may need to reason about the consequences of failure formalizing the pathology of actions providing a systematic theory of ways in which actions and the plans that contain them can go wrong would be a useful addition to planning formalisms and one that would illuminate important themes in philosophythe challenge posed by the ramification problem characterized first in finger 1987 is to formalize the indirect consequences of actions where “indirect” effects are not delayed31 but are temporally immediate but causally derivative if one walks into a room the direct effect is that one is now in the room there are also many indirect effects for instance that one’s shirt also is now in the roomyou can see from this that the formulation of the problem presupposes a distinction between direct consequences of actions ones that attach directly to an action and that are ensured by the successful performance of the action and other consequences this assumption is generally accepted without question in the ai literature on action formalisms you can make a good case for its common sense plausibility—for instance many of our words for actions ‘to warm’ to ‘lengthen’ ‘to ensure’ are derived from the effects that are conventionally associated with them and in these cases success is entailed if someone has warmed something this entails that it became warm 32 a typical example is discussed in lin 1995 a certain suitcase has two locks and is open if and only if both locks are open then assuming that actions are not performed concurrently opening one lock will open the suitcase if and only if the other lock is open here opening a lock is an action with direct consequences opening a suitcase is not an action it is an indirect effectobviously the ramification problem is intimately connected with the frame problem in approaches that adopt nonmonotonic solutions to the frame problem inertial defaults will need to be overridden by conclusions about ramifications in order to obtain correct results in case the left lock of the suitcase is open for instance and an action of opening the right lock is performed then the default conclusion that the suitcase remains closed needs somehow to be suppressed some approaches to the ramification problem depend on the development of theories of common sense causation and therefore are closely related to the causal approaches to reasoning about time and action discussed below in section 46 see for instance giunchiglia et al 1997 thielscher 1989 lin 1995philosophical logicians have been content to illustrate their ideas with relatively smallscale examples the formalization of even largescale mathematical theories is relatively unproblematic logicist ai is the first branch of logic to undertake the task of formalizing large examples involving nontrivial common sense reasoning in doing so the field has had to invent new methods an important part of the methodology that has emerged in formalizing action and change is the prominence that is given to challenges posed in the form of scenarios these scenarios represent formalization problems which usually involve relatively simple realistic examples designed to challenge the logical theories in specific ways typically there will be clear common sense intuitions about the inferences that should be drawn in these cases the challenge is to design a logical formalism that will provide general wellmotivated solutions to these benchmark problemsamong the many scenarios that have been discussed in the literature are the baby scenario the bus ride scenario the chess board scenario the ferryboat connection scenario the furniture assembly scenario the hiding turkey scenario the kitchen sink scenario the russian turkey scenario the stanford murder mystery the stockholm delivery scenario the stolen car scenario the stuffy room scenario the ticketed car scenario the walking turkey scenario and the yale shooting anomaly accounts of these can be found in shanahan 1997 and sandewall 1994 see especially sandewall 1994chapters 2 and 7many of these scenarios are designed to test advanced problems that will not be discussed here—for instance challenges dealing with multiple agents or with continuous changes here we concentrate on one of the earliest and probably the most subtle of these scenarios the yale shooting anomaly first reported in hanks mcdermott 1985 and published in hanks mcdermott 1986 hanks mcdermott 1987the yale shooting anomaly involves three actions load shoot and wait a propositional fluent loaded tracks whether a certain pistol is loaded another fluent alive tracks whether a certain person fred is alive load has no preconditions its only effect is loaded the fluent shoot has loaded as its only precondition and alive as a negative effect wait has no preconditions and no effectscausal information regarding the axioms is formalized as followsthere is no wait axiom—that is wait has no preconditions and no effectswe will formalize the inertial reasoning in this scenario using a nonmonotonic logic—to be specific we use reiter’s default logic the set d of defaults for this theory consists of all instances of the inertial schema ir in the initial situation fred is alive and the pistol is unloadedthe monotonic theory w of the scenario consists of 1 the action axioms load shoot 1 and shoot 2 and 2 the initial conditions ic1 and ic2 let s1 resultloads0 s2 resultwaits1 and s3 resultshoots2the yale shooting anomaly arises because this theory allows an extension in which the actions are load shoot wait and in the final situation s3 the pistol is unloaded and fred is alive the initial situation in the anomaly and the three actions with their resulting situations can be pictured as followsthe natural expected outcome of these axioms is that the pistol is loaded and fred is alive after waiting so that shooting yields a final outcome in which fred is not alive and the pistol is unloaded there is no problem in showing that this corresponds to an extension the problem is the presence of the other anomalous extension which looks like thishere is a narrative version of this extension at first fred is alive and the pistol is unloaded after loading the pistol is loaded and fred remains alive after waiting the pistol becomes unloaded and fred remains alive shooting is then vacuous since the pistol is unloaded so finally after shooting fred remains alive and the pistol remains unloadedthe best way to see clearly that this is an extension is to work through the proof less formally though you can see that the expected extension violates just one default the frame default for alive is violated when fred changes state in the last step but the anomalous extension also violates only one default the frame default for loaded is violated when the pistol spontaneously becomes unloaded while waiting so if you just go by the number of defaults that are violated both extensions are equally goodthe yale shooting anomaly represents a major obstacle in developing a theory of predictive reasoning a plausible wellmotivated logical solution to the frame problem runs afoul of a simple crisp example in which it clearly delivers the wrong results naturally the literature concerning the yale shooting problem is extensive surveys of some of this work with bibliographical references can be found in shanahan 1997 morgenstern 1996many formalisms have been proposed to deal with the problems surveyed in the previous section some are more or less neglected today several are still advocated and defended by leading experts some of these are associated with research groups who are not only interested in developments of logical theory but in applications in planning and cognitive roboticsthe leading approaches provide solutions to the main problems mentioned in section 45 and to many of the scenarios designed to test and illustrate theories of reasoning about action and change it is commonly agreed that good solutions need to be generalizable to more complex cases than the early planning formalisms and that in particular the solutions they offer should be deployable even when continuous time concurrent actions and various kinds of ignorance are allowed also it is generally agreed that the formalisms should support several kinds of reasoning and in particular not only prediction and plan verification but retrodiction ie construction of a sequence of states and actions from partial information presented in narrative formwe describe four approaches here 1 features and fluents sandewall 2 motivated action theory morgenstern and stein 3 state minimization in the event calculus shanahan and 4 causal theories lifschitz and others the accounts of the first three in what follows will be fairly brief fortunately each approach is well documented in a single reference the fourth approach is most likely to be interesting to philosophers and to contain elements that will be of lasting importance regardless of future developments in this areathis approach described in sandewall 1994 uses preference semantics as a way to organize nonmonotonic solutions to the problems of reasoning about action and change rather than introducing a single logical framework sandewall considers a number of temporal logics including ones that use discrete continuous and branching time the properties of the logics are systematically tested against a large suite of test scenariosthis theory grew out of direct consideration of the problems in temporal reasoning described above in section 45 and especially the yale shooting scenario in morgenstern stein 1994 morgenstern and stein seek to find a general intuitively motivated logical framework that solves the difficulties they settle on the idea that unmotivated actions are to be minimized where an action “actions” construed generally enough to include any change can be motivated directly eg by an axiom or indirectly through chains of motivations the key technical idea of the paper is a rather complicated definition of motivation in an intervalbased temporal logic in morgenstern 1996 morgenstern presents a summary of the theory along with reasons for rejecting its causal rivals the most important of these reasons is that these theories based on the situation calculus do not appear to generalize to cases allowing for concurrency and ignorance she also cites the failure of early causal theories to deal with retrodictionin baker 1989 andrew baker presented a solution to the version of the yale shooting problem in the situation calculus using a circumscriptive inertial axiom the very brief account of circumscription above in section 3 indicated that circumscription uses preferred models in which the extensions of certain predicates are minimized in the course of this minimization a set of parameters including of course the predicates to be minimized is allowed to vary the rest are held constant which parameters vary and which are held constant is determined by the applicationin the earliest circumscriptive solutions to the frame problem the inertial rule cir is stated using an abnormality predicatethis axiom uses a biconditional so that it can be used for retrodiction this is typical of the more recent formulations of common sense inertia in circumscribing the abnormality predicate is minimized while the holds predicate is allowed to vary and all other parameters are fixed this formalization succumbs to the yale shooting anomaly in much the same way that default logic does circumscription does not involve multiple extensions so the problem emerges as the nonderivability of the conclusion that fred is alive after the occurrence of the shootingin baker’s reformulation of the problem separate axioms ensure the existence of a situation corresponding to each boolean combination of fluents and the result function is allowed to vary while the holds predicate is held constant in this setting the result function needs to be specified for “counterfactual”actions—in particular for shooting as well as for waiting in the yale shooting anomaly it is this feature that eliminates the incorrect model for that scenario for details see baker 1989 and shanahan 1997 chapter 6this idea which shanahan calls “statebased minimization” is developed and extended in shanahan 1997 in the context of a temporal logic deriving from the event calculus of kowalski and sergot see kowalski sergot 1986 shanahan’s formalism has the advantage of being closely connected to implementations using logic programmingrecall that in the anomalous model of the yale shooting scenario the gun becomes unloaded after the performance of the wait action an action which has no conventional effects—the unloading then is uncaused in the context of a nonmonotonic logic—and without such a logic the yale shooting anomaly would not arise—it is very natural to formalize this by treating uncaused eventualities as abnormalities to be minimizedthis strategy was pursued by hector geffner in geffner 1992 1990 where he formalizes this simple causal solution to the yale shooting anomaly but the solution is presented in the context of an ambitious general project in nonmonotonic logic that not only develops properties of the preferred model approach and shows how to apply it to a number of reasoning problems but that relates nonmonotonic logic to probabilities using ideas deriving from adams 1975 in geffner 1992 the causal theory is sketched it is not developed to show its adequacy in dealing with the battery of problems presented above and in particular the ramification problem is left untouchedthe work beginning with lifschitz 1987 has contributed to a sustained line of research in the causal approach—not only by lifschitz and students of his such as enrico giunchiglia and hudson turner but by researchers at other sites for work in this area and further references see thielscher 1989 gustaffson doherty 1996 baral 1995 nakashima et al 1997 lifschitz 1997 giunchiglia lifschitz 1998 lin 1995 haugh 1987 lifschitz 1998 turner 1999 mccain turner 1995 elkan 1991 mccain turner 1997 thielscher 1996 and gelfond lifschitz 1998here we briefly describe some of theories developed by the texas action group leading up to the causal solution presented in turner 1999 turner returns to the ideas of geffner 1992 but places them in a simpler logical setting and applies them to the formalization of more complex scenarios that illustrate the interactions of causal inertia with other considerations especially the ramification problemramification is induced by the presence of static laws which relate the direct consequences of actions to other changes let’s use a carstarting scenario to illustrate the difficulties there is one action turnon which turns on the ignition let’s suppose that this action has no preconditions there is a fluent ig tracking whether the ignition is on a fluent dead tracking whether the battery is dead and a fluent run tracking whether the engine is running a static law says that if the ignition is on and the battery isn’t dead the engine is running let’s suppose that every other source of failure has already been eliminated in this scenario the only possible reason for not starting is the battery we want to consider a transition in which turnon is performed in a situation in which the ignition is not on the battery is not dead and the car isn’t runningof course we want a planning agent to be able to infer in such a case that a performance of turnon will result in a situation in which the ignition is on the battery isn’t dead and the engine is running but contraposition of laws makes it difficult to devise a principled solution informally this difficulty is this we can conclude by contraposing our only static law that if the ignition is on and the engine isn’t running then the battery is dead this law not only is true in our scenario but would be used to explain a failed attempt to start the car but if we allow it to be used for prediction then it is hard to see how to rule out an outcome of turnon in which the ignition is on the battery is dead and the engine isn’t running the battery is dead in this outcome because of causal inertia the engine isn’t running because of the contraposed causal lawreaders who want to explore in some detail the problems of embedding a nonmonotonic solution to the frame problem in relatively expressive action languages can look to gelfond lifschitz 1998 this paper presents an increasingly powerful and sophisticated series of action languages their language incorporates an ad hoc or at least purely syntactic solution to the ramification problema theory in language b consists of two sets of axiomsgelfond and lifschitz impose a weak closure condition on static laws where s is a set of literals s is restrictedclosed with respect to a b theory t rbclts if and only if every literal that would be added by starting with s and forwardchaining through the static laws of b is already in s in other wordsthe closure operation induced by this condition is used in defining resultas for the language b of course this solution treats logically equivalent static laws differently for instance a theory whose only static law is p ∧ ¬q →r will in general determine a very different result function than one whose only static law is p ∧ ¬r →qthis has some somewhat counterintuitive effects in the carstarting scenario gelfond and lifschitz’ language b indeed yields the desired conclusion that the car will start when there is one dynamic lawwhen the only static law iswhen the initial state is s ¬ig ¬dead ¬run and when the action turnon is performedhowever if we add a true static law saying that if the ignition is on and the engine isn’t running the battery is dead we get an anomaly with the addition of this law there is a model in which preserving the fact that the car is not running makes the battery become dead when the ignition is turned onif the two static laws ig ∧ ¬dead → run and ig ∧ ¬run → dead are reformulated using causal language the former sounds correct while the second is distinctly problematic comparewiththis makes it very plausible to suppose that the source of the problem is a representation of underlying causal information in action language b that is somehow inadequategelfond and lifschitz go on to describe another action language c which invokes an explicit notion of causality—motivated in all likelihood in part by the need to provide a more principled solution to the problem instead of describing that language we now discuss the similar theory of turner 1999turner’s idea is to treat caused as a modal operator c making this the basis of a modal nonmonotonic logic in the preferred models of this logic the caused propositions coincide with the propositions that are true and this must be the only possibility consistent with the extensional part of the model to make this more explicit recall that in the possible worlds interpretation of s5 it is possible to identify possible worlds with state descriptions which we can represent as sets i of literals atomic formulas and their negations making this identification then we can think of a model as a pair i s where s is a set of interpretations complete consistent sets of literals including i the modal operator c is given the standard semantics where s is a set of interpretations and where i ∈ s s ⊨i c a if and only if s ⊨i′ a for all i′ ∈s i s satisfies a set of formulas t if and only if s ⊨i a for all a ∈ tturner’s preferred models of t are the pairs i s such that 1 i s satisfies t 2 s i and 3 i s is the unique interpretation i′ s′ meeting conditions 1 and 2 with i′ i condition 2 guarantees the “universality of causation” it validates a ↔ c a condition 3 “grounds” causality in noncausal information in the models in which we are interested this will be information about the occurrence of events in the strongest sense it is uniquely determined by this informationalthough it is not evident from the formulation turner’s account of preferred models is related to the constructions of more general nonmonotonic logics such as default logic consult turner 1999 for detailsthe axioms that specify the effects of actions treat these effects as caused for instance the axiom schema for loading would read as followsramifications of the immediate effects of actions are also treated as caused and the nonmonotonic inertial axiom schemata take the formc holdsfs ∧ holdsfresultas → c holdsfr esultasandc ¬holdsfs ∧ ¬holdsfresultas → c ¬holdsfresultasthus a true proposition can be caused either because it is the direct or indirect effect of an action or because it involves the persistence of a caused proposition initial conditions are also considered to be caused by stipulationto illustrate the workings of this approach let’s consider the simplest case of inertia we have a language with just one constant denoting a fluent f and one actiondenoting constant wait as in the yale shooting problem there are no axioms for wait this action can always be performed and has no associated effects let s1 be resultwaits 0 the theory t contains an initial condition for f holdsfs0 and a statement that the initial condition is caused c holdsfs 0 as well as the inertial schematatwo models of t satisfy conditions 1 and 2where i1 holdsfs0 holdsfs1 and i2 holdsfs0 ¬holdsfs1m1 is the intended model in which nothing changes it satisfies condition 3 since if i1 s satisfies t it satisfies c holdsfs 1 by the inertial axiomtherefore s i1m2 is an anomalous model in which the fluent ceases spontaneously this model does not satisfy condition 3 since m3 i2i1 i2 also satisfies t in particular it satisfies the inertial axiom for f because it fails to satisfy holdsfs1 so while m1 is a preferred model m2 is notturner’s approach avoids the problem of contraposition by giving causal relations the formwhen contraposed this becomeswhich does not have the form of a causal law this solution is less than fully satisfactory at solving the intuitive difficulties because turner’s semantics seems intuitively to validate formulas such asand in this form contraposition would be restored the task of clarifying the foundations of causal theories of action and change may not yet be completebut the apparent usefulness of a “principle of universal causality” in accounting for a range of problems in qualitative common sense reasoning will be tantalizing to philosophers and the causal theory as initiated by geffner and developed by turner has many interesting detailed features for instance while philosophical work on causality has concentrated on the causal relation this work in logical ai shows that a great deal can be done by using only a nonrelational causal predicatethe relation between causality and conditionals can be explored and exploited in various ways lewis 1977 undertakes to account for causality in terms of conditionals in the reverse direction lent and thomason 2015 uses turner’s causal approach to construct models for conditional logics in the restricted case where the antecedent is the conjunction of an action expression and simple situational conditions the motivation for this idea is than an explicit solution to the frame problem automatically provides a semantics for such conditionalsmorgenstern’s two chief criticisms of the causal approach to reasoning about actions are that it does not give an adequate account of explanation34 and that the logical context in which it works the situation calculus is limited as work on the approach continues progress is being made in these areas but the constraints that a successful logic of action and change must meet are so complex that it seems to be a reasonable research methodology to concentrate initially on a restricted logical settingfor another approach to nonmonotonic causal reasoning based on inputoutput logics makinson van der torre 2000 see bochman 2004although for many ai logicists the goal of action formalisms is to illuminate an important aspect of common sense reasoning most of their research is uninformed by an important source of insights into the common sense view of time—namely natural language linguists concerned with the semantics of temporal constructions in natural language like the ai community have begun with ideas from philosophical logic but have discovered that these ideas need to be modified in order to deal with the phenomena a chief discovery of the ai logicists has been the importance of actions and their relation to change similarly an important discovery of the “natural language logicists” has been the importance of different kinds of events including structured composite events in interpreting natural language from work such as this the idea of “natural language metaphysics” see for instance bach 1989 has emergedthe goal of articulating a logical framework tailored to a representational system that is motivated by systematic evidence about meanings in natural languages is not acknowledged by all linguistic semanticists nevertheless it is a significant theme in the linguistic literature this goal is remarkably similar to those of the common sense logicists but the research methodology is entirely differentcan the insights of these separate traditions be reconciled and unified is it possible to constrain theories of temporal representations and reasoning with the insights and research methodologies of both traditions in steedman 1995 and 2000 listed in the other internet resources section these important questions are addressed and a theory is developed that extends action formalisms like the situation calculus and that incorporates many of the insights from linguistic semantics the project reported in steedman 2000 is still incomplete but the results reported there make a convincing case that the eventbased ideas from linguistics can be fruitfully combined with the actioncentered formalisms in the ai literature the possibility of this unification is one of the most exciting logical developments in this area bringing together as it does two independent descendants of the earlier work in the logic of timein section 46 we traced the reasons for the development of theories incorporating causality in work on reasoning about action and change this is not the only area of ai in which causality has emerged causality figures in qualitative reasoning about devices for herbert simon’s important work in this area which goes back to the 1950s see simon 1952 1977 iwasaki simon 1986 both these traditions are important but the most robust and highly developed program in ai relating to causality is that of judea pearl and his students and associates which derives from statistical techniques known as structural equation models halpern and pearl 2001 introduced the idea that causal relations among events could be inferred from these models bayesian belief networks could be interpreted as causal networkspearl’s program has developed into a farreaching campaign to rehabilitate causality in statistical thinking we shall not discuss this topic here for one thing this survey omits probabilistic reasoning in ai for another pearl’s views on causality are systematically and comprehensively presented in a recent booklength study pearl 2000but it is important to point out that the work on causality discussed in section 46 and pearl’s ideas do share some common themes on both approaches action is central for causality also there is a focus on causality as a tool in reasoning that is necessitated in part by limited resources another important theme is the deployment and systematic study of formalisms in which causality is related to other constructs in particular to probability and to qualitative change and a variety of realistic reasoning problems are addressedthese commonalities provide reason to hope that we will see a science of causality emerging from the ai research unifying the contributions of the probabilistic the qualitative physics and the nonmonotonic traditions and illuminating the various phases of causal reasoninga recent landmark in this direction is halpern 2016 which develops and applies the general theory of event causality that arises from the causal network approach although halpern is a computer scientist a large part of this book is philosophical exploring notions such as blame and explanation but the book also explores practical applications of the approach that would not occur to philosophers in areas such as software fault diagnosiswhether you take causality to be a fundamental construct in natural science or a fundamental common sense phenomenon depends on whether you have in mind an idealized nature described by differential equations or you have in mind the view of nature we have to take in order to act either in everyday situations or for that matter in designing experiments in the laboratory the fact that as bertrand russell noted see russell 1957 causality is not to be found as a theoretical primitive in contemporary physical theories is at odds with its seeming importance in so many familiar areas of reasoning the rigorous theories emerging in ai that are beginning to illuminate the workings of causality are important not only in themselves but in their potentiality to illuminate wider philosophical issuesthe precomputational literature in philosophical logic relating to spatial reasoning is very sparse in relation for instance to the temporal literature the need to support computational reasoning about space however in application areas such as motion planning and manipulation in physical space the indexing and retrieval of images geographic information systems diagrammatic reasoning and the design of highlevel graphics programs has led to new interest in spatial representations and spatial reasoning of course the geometrical tradition provides an exceptionally strong mathematical resource for this enterprise but as in many other airelated areas it is not clear that the available mathematical theories are appropriate for informing these applications and many computer scientists have felt it worthwhile to develop new foundations some of this work is closely related to the research in qualitative reasoning mentioned above in section 22 and in some cases has been carried out by the same individualsthe literature in spatial reasoning is extensive for references to some areas not discussed here see stock 1997 kapur mundy 1988 hammer 1995 wilson 1998 osherson lasnik 1990 renz nebel 1999 yeap jeffries 1999 forbus et al 1991 chen 1990 burger bhanu 1992 allwein barwise 1996 glasgow et al 1995 and kosslyn 1990 here we discuss only one trend which is closely connected with parallel work in philosophical logicqualitative approaches to space were introduced into the logical literature early in the twentieth century by lesniewski see lesniewski 1916 which presents the idea of a mereology or qualitative theory of the partwhole relation between physical individuals this idea of a logical theory of relations among regions or the objects that occupy them which does not depend on construing regions as sets of points remained an active area of philosophical logic even though it attracted relatively few researchers more recent work in the philosophical literature especially casati varzi 1999 simons 1987 casati varzi 1996 clarke 1981 clarke 1985 as directly influential on current computational workthe regional connection calculus rcc developed by computer scientists at the university of leeds is based on a primitive c relating regions of space the intended interpretation of cx y is that the intersection of the closures of the values of x and y is nonempty see cohn et al 1997 cohn 1996 for details and references one area of research concerns the definability of shapes in rcc the extent of what can be defined with this simple primitive is surprising but the technicalities quickly become complex see for instance gotts 1994 gotts 1996 the work cited in cohn et al 1997 describes constraint propagation techniques and encodings in intuitionistic propositional logic as ways of supporting implemented reasoning based on rcc and some of its extensions more recent work based on rcc addresses representation and reasoning about motion which of course combines spatial and temporal issues see wolter zakharyaschev 2000 for more information about qualitative theories of movement with references to other approaches see galton 1997epistemic logic is another area in which logic in computer science have been influenced by philosophical logic the classical source for epistemic logic is hintikka 1962 in which jaakko hintikka showed that a modal approach to singleagent epistemic attitudes could be informative and rewarding this work discusses at length the question of exactly which constraints are appropriate for knowledge and belief when these attitudes are viewed as explicated by a model theoretic relation over possible worlds in both cases hintikka argues for s4 type operatorsin several papers including mccarthy 1979 john mccarthy has recommended an approach to formalizing knowledge that uses firstorder logic but that quantifies explicitly over such things as individual concepts in this section we discuss the approach taken by most computer scientists who unlike mccarthy use a modal language to formalize propositional attitudesthe logical aspects of modal epistemic logic were not significantly developed after hintikka’s 1962 presentation instead the philosophical literature which is not extensive compared with many other topics in the area concentrates on the issue of hyperintensionality or closure of epistemic attitudes under logical consequence this topic is especially challenging turning out to be closely related to the semantic paradoxes and the philosophical literature is inconclusive intuitions seem to conflict and it is difficult to find ways to model the important phenomena using logical techniques35fagin et al 1984 begins a tradition in computational logic that revives the modal approach to epistemic logic developing generalized logical foundations and applications that had not occurred to the philosophers the technical idea is to simplify the modality using s5 or deontic s5 for belief but to introduce multiple agents and to concentrate on reasoning having to do with agents’ attitudes about one another’s attitudes such logics have direct applications in the analysis of distributed systems dynamic systems in which change is effected by message actions which change the knowledge of agents according to rules determined by a communications protocolas such this work belongs to a separate area of computer science but one that overlaps to some extent with ai later this work has interacted with a research tradition in economics that is concerned with the role of knowledge in games and bargaining see for instance geanakopolos 1994 osborne rubenstein 1994 chapter 5for some reason the multiagent case did not occur to philosophical logicians36 this is another example of the way in which need for an application in this case the need for a theory of distributed systems provided the inspiration for an important logical development the logical details are extensively and systematically recorded in fagin et al 1995 this is essential reading for anyone seriously interested in this topicmuch of the interdisciplinary work in applications of the logic of knowledge is reported in the proceedings of a series of conferences initiated in 1986 with halpern 1986 these conferences record one of the most successful collaborations of philosophers with logicians in computer science although the group of involved philosophers has been relatively small the focus of the conferences has gradually shifted from computer science to economicsai applications deal with with knowledge in the form of stored representations and the tradition in ai with which we are concerned here thinks of reasoning as the manipulation of symbolic representations also it is mainly due to ai that the problem of limited rationality has become a topic of serious interest providing a counterbalance to the idealizations of philosophy and economics37 so you would think that a logical model of propositional attitudes that is committed to closure under logical consequence would be highly unpopular in ai but this is not so the possible worlds approach to attitudes is not only the leading theory in the areas discussed in fagin et al 1995 but has even been advocated in robotics applications see rosenschein kaelbling 1995 rosenschein 1989 nevertheless the issue of hyperintensionality has been investigated in the ai literature see perlis 1985 konolige 1986 lakemeyer 1997 levesque 1984 though there are some new positive results here the ai work in this area has for the most part been as inconclusive as that in philosophythe philosophical literature on a related topic the logic of perception has not been extensive the main reference is hintikka 197038 but sensation is addressed in recent work in the ai literature which is concerned with developing logical frameworks for generalpurpose applications in robotics the main idea in this area is to add sensing actions to the repertoire of a planning formalism of the sort discussed in section 4 the earliest work in this area was carried out in the 1980s by robert moore see moore 1995b moore 1985 for some of the contemporary work in cognitive robotics see baral et al 2000 bacchus et al 1999 golden weld 1996 pirri finzi 1999 and thielscher 2000john mccarthy’s explicit longterm goal—the formalization of common sense knowledge—has been adopted and pursued by a relatively small but active subcommunity of ai researchers a larger group those involved in knowledge representation cognitive robotics and qualitative physics can be considered to work on specialized projects that support the larger goal anything like a formalization of common sense is so far from being accomplished that—if it is achievable at all—it is not even possible to estimate when we could expect the task to be completed however since 2001 the date of a symposium on common sense reasoning held at the courant institute—see the common sense 2001 homepage something like a cooperative sustained effort in this direction has begun to emerge this effort is yielding a better sense of how to develop a workable methodology for formalizing common sense and of how to divide the larger problem up into more manageable parts many of the papers presented at this conference were presented in expanded form in 2004 in an issue of artificial intelligence the introduction to this issue davis morgenstern 2004 provides a useful survey and appreciation of the general research areathis cooperative formalization effort 1 seeks to account for many areas of knowledge and at the same time 2 attempts to see how this formalized knowledge can be brought to bear on moderately complex commonsense reasoning problems the first booklength treatment of this topic davis 1991 divides the general problem into the following subtopicsseveral of these topics overlap with concerns of the qualitative physics and qualitative reasoning community although it can be hard to tell where common sense ends and physics begins the formalization of common sense reasoning can be seen as a more general formalization project that can draw on a tradition in qualitative physics that has gone through many years of development and by now is fairly mature39and a few of them overlap with the work on the formalization of planning that was described above in section 4 minds and society however are new and different topics the former has to do with common sense psychology and its application in introspective and interpersonal reasoning and the latter of course should have to do with social and political knowledge and reasoning but this is the leastdeveloped area of formalized common sense knowledge the chapter on this topic in davis 1991 is very brief and discusses mutual attitudes and communication more recently andrew s gordon and jerry hobbs have undertaken a largescale ambitious formalization of commonsense psychology see for instance hobbs gordon 2005a more recent booklength treatment of the formalization of common sense mueller 2006 follows a similar pattern more than half of the book is devoted to reasoning about actions and change there are short chapters on space and mental states and a longer treatment of default reasoning although logical techniques and formalization methods take center stage in this book it also contains material on nonlogical methods and on implementations related to the formalizationseven when attempted on a moderate scale the formalization of common sense knowledge puts considerable pressure on the resources of even the most powerful logical systems that were devised for the formalization of mathematics as we tried to show in discussing the special case of action and planning in section 4 this pressure may lead us to seek logics that can facilitate the formalization projects for instance nonmonotomic logics and logics that explicitly represent contextwhen largerscale formalizations are attempted other challenges arise that are similar to those that software engineering tries to address even fairly small programs and systems of axioms are difficult to comprehend and can be highly unpredicable yielding unexpected consequences and unanticipated interactions the creation and use of larger programs and formalizations raises questions of how to enable teams of developers to produce coherent results when modules are integrated how to maintain and test large systems and how to use knowledge sources such as dictionaries and knowledge bases to automatically generate axiomsyou can think of the philosophical methodology of providing analyses as a collection of attempts to formalize or partially formalize various common sense notions these attempts are far smaller in scale less systematic and more heterogeneous than the parallel effort that is emerging in ai philosophers have never chosen a specific domain comparable to the planning domain and mounted a sustained attempt to formalize it along with a companion effort to develop appropriate logics and no matter how complex the notions with which they which they are concerned philosophers have never allowed their analyses to grow to the complexity where methodological issues arise similar to those that apply to the development and maintenance of large software systemsthe techniques emerging in ai are of great potential significance for philosophy because it is easy to suspect that many philosophically important phenomena have the sort of complexity that can only be dealt with by accepting the problems that go along with developing complex formalizations limitations of the philosophical methods that were used throughout the twentieth century and are still in use may make it impossible to produce theories that do justice to the subject matterit would therefore be a great mistake for philosophers to disparage and ignore the largescale formalizations that are beginning to emerge in ai because these efforts begin to raise engineering issues it may well be that although philosophy requires us to address complex phenomena in a rigorous way the traditional philosophical methods are capable of doing justice to the complexity methods that promise to do this are worth taking seriouslyamong other methods borrowed from computer science the common sense reasoning community has sought to develop suites of “benchmark problems” the idea is to publicize problems that are difficult but not impossibly difficult to encourage the community to create solutions and compare the solutionsprobably the beststudied problem to date is ernest davis’ “eggcracking problem” this is formulated as follows on the common sense reasoning problem webpagealong with the problem itself three solutions are posted shanahan 2004 lifschitz 1998b and a version of morgenstern 2001 comparing the solutions is instructive similarities outweigh differences all the authors think of this as a planning problem and use a versions of the situation calculus or the event calculus in the formalization each axiomatization is modular with for instance separate modules devoted to the relevant geometrical and material properties each author provides a “proof of concept” for the formalization by showing that the axioms support a proof of the correctness of a plan to crack the egg in the simple case none of the authors considers all of davis’ elaborations of the problem but the axioms are framed with elaboration in mind and some elaborations are considered it isn’t clear whether any of the authors actually implemented the formalization for instance using a theorem proverthe eggcracking case raises the problem of how to evaluate moderately large formalizations of common sense problems morgenstern and shanahan express this issue explicitly morgenstern suggests that the important criteria are 1 epistemological adequacy correspondence to intuitive reasoning as experienced by people who engage in it 2 faithfulness to the real world 3 reusability and 4 elaboration tolerance it isn’t clear whether the first two of these criteria are too subjective to be useful to these shanahan adds 5 usability which probably is presupposed by morgenstern’s third criterionthere is anecdotal evidence that the larger ai community is somewhat skeptical about such research projects—or if not skeptical at least puzzled about how to evaluate them in considering these doubts it is necessary to appreciate the complexity of these formalization problems and the preliminary and tentative status of the research program nevertheless this criticism has some legitimacy the common sense reasoning community is sensitive to these criticisms and is working to develop and refine the methods and criteria for evaluating this workas long as formalization problems remain relatively simple we can treat formalization as an art rather than as a discipline with a wellarticulated methodology but the trends we’ve been discussing show that formalization of even moderatesized realistic common sense reasoning problems is not merely an art just as programming systems expert systems and knowledge bases have created corresponding software engineering disciplines largescale formalization projects require a carefully thought through and tested methodologyover the last twentyfive years or so many profound relations have emerged between logic and grammar computational linguistics or natural language processing is a branch of ai and it is fairly natural to classify some of these developments under logic and ai but many of them also belong to an independent tradition in logical foundations of linguistics and in many cases it is hard and pointless to attempt a classification this sketch will concentrate on developments that have to do with reasoning about linguistics other applications of logic to linguistics are described in van benthem ter meulen 1996grammar formalisms—specialpurpose systems for the description of linguistic systems and subsystems—can be thought of as logics designed to axiomatize the association of linguistic structures with strings of symbols you might be able to infer from such a system for instance that ‘assignments’ is the plural form of the nominalization of the verb ‘assign’ so you can look at the process of parsing a string of words—of finding the linguistic structures if any that are associated with it—as a search for a proof in a certain logical systemthis approach has been highly successful as an analytic tool it makes modeltheoretic techniques applicable to linguistic reasoning this makes the underlying reasoning problems much more transparent and makes it possible to apply many welldeveloped areas of logic to grammar formalisms for more information on these topics see buszkowski 1996 shieber 1992the usefulness and scope of logical methods in relation to linguistics is greatly increased by the development of techniques for analyzing the way information attaches to linguistic units it is very natural to represent the information attaching say to a lexical item in the form of a set of functions or attributes that produce values in some linguistic domain a pronoun x may have a number a person and a case if x ‘we’ thenin more general cases the values of these functions may themselves be linguistic units that take on values for certain attributesallowing these functions to be partial provides a useful informational representation of the stages of a linguistic parse much of the work of parsing involves completing this partial information subject to constraints imposed by linguistic agreement conditions feature structures—sets of identities that serve to evaluate linguistic features—have a natural algebraic interpretation and there is an elegant treatment of their logic for more information and references see rounds 1996the reasoning associated with discourse is the probably the least well understood area of computational linguistics although logical techniques do not yet play a major role in discourse they seem to offer one of the most promising ways of providing a uniform account of the many forms of reasoning that are involved in generating and interpreting language in interactive conversationwe briefly mention three contributions to this area building on the fact that the rules governing conversation are exceptionridden alex lascarides and nicholas asher have developed techniques for formalizing discourse phenomena based on nonmonotonic logic see asher lascarides 1994 asher lascarides 1997 jerry hobbs and various coworkers look at the inference processes used in discourse as abductive and propose to formalize abduction as a search for a proof in which certain “lowcost” assumptions may be made which serve as data or additional axioms for the proof hobbs et al 1993 shows how an impressive range of discourse phenomena can be formalized using this idea in practice this abductive account looks rather similar to that of lascarides and asher because it involves deploying axioms about discourse in the form of horn clause rules supplemented with weights giving the assumption costs of premises that in effect are nonmonotonicin more recent work matthew stone shows in stone 1998 how modal logic can inform the complex reasoning involved in natural language generation generating a coherent appropriately phrased text that usefully performs a taskoriented communication task is difficult to formalize because it requires the integration of complex and sophisticated domain information with discourse planning user modeling and linguistic constraints stone shows that modal logic can be used to modularize the formalization of the information required in this task he also shows how modal theorem proving can be used to implement the reasoningtraditionally the task of representing large amounts of domain information for generalpurpose reasoning has been one of the most important areas of knowledge representation systems that exploit the intuitive taxonomic organization of domains are useful for this purpose taxonomic hierarchies not only help to organize the process of knowledge acquisition but provide a useful connection to rulebased reasoning41for domains in which complex definitions are a natural way to organize information knowledge engineering services based on definitions of concepts have been extremely successful like variablefree versions of firstorder logic see for instance quine 1960 these systems are centered on concepts or firstorder predicates and provide a number of mechanisms for their definition the fundamental algorithm associated with these taxonomic logics is a classifier which inputs a system of definitions and outputs the entailment relations between defined and primitive concepts for background on these systems see woods schmolze 1992 and brachman et al 1991the simplest taxonomic logics can be regarded as subsystems of firstorder logic with complex predicates but they have been extended in many ways and the issues raised by many of these extensions overlap in many cases with topics in philosophical logicmuch more complex logical issues arise when the organization of a domain into hierarchies is allowed to have exceptions one way to approach this topic is to explore how to make a taxonomic logic nonmonotonic but nonmonotonic inheritance is a topic in its own right although there are strong affinities to nonmonotonic logic nonmonotonic logic relies more heavily on graphbased representations than on traditional logical ideas and seems to provide a much finergrained approach to nonmonotonic reasoning that raises entirely new issues and which quickly becomes problematic for this reason systems of nonmonotonic inheritance tend to be expressively weak and their relations to the more powerful nonmonotonic logic has never been fully clarified for background on this topic see thomason 1992 horty 1994in the tradition in philosophical logic dealing with contextual effects on the interpretation of expressions as well as in the more recent tradition in dynamic logic context is primarily formalized as an assignment of values to variables and the language is designed to make explicit reasoning about context either very limited or outright impossibleconcern in ai about the representation of large and apparently heterogeneous domains and about the integration of disparate knowledge sources as well as interests in formalizing common sense of the sort discussed in section 22 above have led to interest in the ai community in formalizing languages that take context into account more explicitlyin mccarthy 1993b mccarthy recommends the study of languages containing a constructwhere ist is read “istrue” this is analogous to the holds construct of the situation calculus—but now c stands for a context and φ is a possibly complex propositional representation which many including mccarthy take to refer to a sentencethere are analogies here both to modal logic and to languages with an explicit truth predicate but the applications that are envisioned for a logic of context create opportunities and problems that are in many ways new work on the logic of context subsequent to mccarthy’s original suggestion includes mccarthy buvac 1998 guha 1991 and some of the papers in the conference volumes akman et al 2001 bouquet et al 1999 for extensions of richard montague’s intensional logic motivated by mccarthy’s suggestions see thomason 2003 and 2005for some reason work on the explicit formalization of context hasn’t been actively pursued by the computational community beyond this point philosophical interest in context and especially in the interaction of context with propositional attitudes and modals continues to be strong but the very general logical frameworks for context that mccarthy envisioned have yet not been taken up by philosophersthere is reason to hope that the combination of logical methods with planning applications in ai can enable the development of a far more comprehensive and adequate theory of practical reasoning than has heretofore been possible as with many problems having to do with common sense reasoning the scale and complexity of the formalizations that are required are beyond the traditional techniques of philosophical logic however with computational methods of implementing and testing the formalizations and with areas such as cognitive robotics to serve as laboratories for developing and testing ideas we can hope to radically advance a problem that has seen little progress since it was first proposed by aristotle the problem of devising a formalization of practical reasoning that is genuinely applicable to common sense reasoning problemsthe classical work in deontic logic that was begun by von wright see von wright 1983 is one source of ideas see horty 2001 van der torre 1997 in fact as the more recent work in deontic logic shows nonmonotonic logic provides a natural and useful supplement to the classical deontic logic one recent work horty 2012 seeks to base deontic logic on a prioritized version of reiter’s default logican even more robust account of practical reasoning begins to emerge when these ideas are supplemented with work on the foundations of planning and reasoning about action that were discussed in section 4 above but this development can be pursued even further by extending the formalism to include preferences and intentions42ultimately what is needed is a model of an intelligent reasoning and acting agent developing such a model need not be entirely a matter of logic but according to one school of thought logic has a central role to play in it see for instance baral gelfond 2000 wobcke et al 1998 rao georgeff 1991 burkhard et al 1998conditionals frame problem logic nonmonotonic reasoning automatedi am grateful to john mccarthy who read a

the most advanced and sophisticated methods of artificial intelligence neural networks genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic in the age of internet and network games artificial intelligence systems in games have been given new tasks a computer player should in its behaviour and strategies of playing be indistinguishable from a real player on the other side of an internet connectionwhile discussing the evolution of artificial intelligence in computer games one definitely should mention the games which have turned out to be milestones in the development of intelligent behaviour in gamesone of the most popular games of the 1990s was warcraft – a game developed by the blizzard studio it was the first game to employ pathfinding algorithms at such a grand scale for hundreds of units in the game engaged in massive battles simcity created by the company maxis was the first game to prove the feasibility of using alife technologies in the field of computer games another milestone turned out to be the game blackwhite created in 2001 by lionhead studios in which technologies of computercontrolled characters learning were used for the first timefpstype games usually implement the layered structure of the artificial intelligence system layers located at the very bottom handle the most elementary tasks such as determining the optimal path to the target determined by a layer higher up in the hierarchy or playing appropriate sequences of character animation the higher levels are responsible for tactical reasoning and selecting the behaviour which an ai agent should assume in accordance with its present strategypathfinding systems are usually based on graphs describing the world each vertex of a graph represents a logical location such as a room in the building or a fragment of the battlefield when ordered to travel to a given point the ai agent acquires using the graphs subsequent navigation points it should consecutively head towards in order to reach the specified target location moving between navigation points the ai system can also use local paths which make it possible to determine an exact path between two navigation points as well as to avoid dynamically appearing obstaclesthe animation system plays an appropriate sequence of animation at the chosen speed it should also be able to play different animation sequences for different body parts for example a soldier can run and aim at the enemy and shoot and reload the weapon while still running games of this kind often employ the inverted kinematics system an ik animation system can appropriately calculate the parameters of arm positioning animation so that the hand can grab an object located on eg a table or a shelf the task of modules from higher layers is to choose the behaviour appropriate for the situation – for instance whether the agent should patrol the area enter combat or run through the map in search of an opponentonce the ai system has decided which behaviour is the most appropriate for the given situation a lowerlevel module has to select the best tactics for fulfilling that task having received information that the agent should for instance fight it tries to determine the approach that is the best at the moment – eg whether we should sneak up on the opponent hide in a corner and wait for the opponent to present a target of itself or perhaps just run at him shooting blindlyin rtstype games it is possible to distinguish several modules of the artificial intelligence system and its layered structure one of the basic modules is an effective pathfinding system – sometimes it has to find a movement solution for hundreds of units on the map in split seconds – and there is more to it than merely finding a path from point a to point b as it is also important to detect collisions and handle the units in the battlefield avoid each other such algorithms are typically based on the game map being represented by a rectangular grid with its mesh representing fixedsized elements of the area on higher levels of the ai systems hierarchy there are modules responsible for economy development or very importantly a module to analyse the game map it is that module which analyses the properties of the terrain and a settlement is built based on the assessment eg whether the settlement is located on an island thus requiring higher pressure on building a navy the terrain analyser decides when cities should be built and how fortifications should be placedfigure 1 representation of the world in a rtstype gamefigure 2 representation of the world in a fpstype gamebasically in the case of most sports games we are dealing with largescale cheating take car racing games for instance for the needs of the ai from the geometry of the game map only and only the polygons belonging to the track of a computercontrolled opponent should travel on and get distinguished two curves are then marked on that track the first represents the optimal driving track the second – the track used when overtaking opponents the whole track gets split into appropriately small sectors and having taken parameters of the surface into account each element of the split track gets its length calculated those fragments are then used to build a graph describing the track and to obtain characteristics of the road in the vehicles closest vicinity in effect the computer knows it should slow down because its approaching the curve or knows that its approaching an intersection and can eg take a shortcut two important attributes of artificial intelligence systems in such games is being able to analyse the terrain in order to detect obstacles lying on the road and strict cooperation with the physics module the physics module can provide information that the car is skidding having received which the artificial intelligence system should react appropriately and try to get the vehicles traction back under controlfigure 3 the method of presentation of reality in car race segmentation and optimalisation of the trackfigure 4 the method of presentation of reality in car racesimilar cheating can also be found in other sports games in most cases a computercontrolled player has its complete behaviour determined even before the beginning of the turn – that is it will eg fall over while landing acrobatics ski jumping etc have the wrong velocity start false etc additionally in games simulating sports with scoring by judges the scores are generated according to the rules defined by the appropriate sports bodiesthe predefined scenario of a computercontrolled player is then acted out by the character animation systemin the following part of the article i would like to discuss the two most popular algorithms used in programming computer games possessing knowledge about them one can successfully design a simple artificial intelligence system fulfilling the needs of simple fps or rts games the first of the two is the astar algorithm used in performing fast searches for the optimal path connecting two points on the map graph of a game the other is the finite state machine useful eg in preparing behaviour scenarios for computercontrolled opponents typically delegating its lowlevel tasks to a pathfinding modulethe problem of finding a way from point a to point b on a map is a key problem in almost any computer game possibly not counting certain sports games and some other types of games which can be counted using the digits of one hand at the same time algorithms from this group belong to the lower level of the games ai serving as a base for constructing more complicated and more intelligent types of behaviour such as strategic planning moving in formations or groups and many others this issue has already been thoroughly evaluated in the world of computer games with one algorithm – a – having become a presentday standardthe world of almost any computer game can be represented with a graph its form depending on the kind of the game in rtstype games the world is typically represented by a twodimensional array each of its elements corresponding to fragments of the game worlds rectangular map each element except boundary ones has eight neighbours using such a representation of the rts world we can construct a graph in which every element of the 2d array will be corresponded to by one vertex of the graph the edges of the graph typically present only between the nearest neighbours illustrate the possibility or lack thereof of moving from one of the elements of the map to the neighbouring element in realtime strategies we usually assign one vertex of the graph to an area the smallest unit in the game can fit intoin fpstype games the vertices of the graph are typically locationsrooms with the graphs vertices denoting the existence of a direct connection between the two roomsthere are a lot of algorithms for finding the optimal path in a graph the most simple of such algorithms commonly called fire on the prairie works by constructing consecutive circles around the starting point with each step of the algorithm building another wider circle consecutive circles and elements belonging to them are assigned larger and larger indices as one can see in figure 5 the circle with index 4 passes through our target pointfigure 5 a simple pathfinding algorithmnow heading in the opposite direction and following the rule that in each step we move to the nearest map point located on the circle with a smaller index we reach the starting point the elements of our map we have returned through make up the shortest path between the starting point and the destinationexamining the way this algorithm works one can see that in addition to its great advantage – the simplicity – it also possesses a severe drawback the path the algorithm has found in our example consists of only five elements of the game world even though 81 fields of the map would have to be examined in the worstcase scenario in case of a map consisting of 256x256 fields it might mean having to examine 65536 map elementsenter a and its primary advantage – minimisation of areas being examined by consciously orienting the search towards the target keeping it brief i could say that when calculating the cost of reaching a point on the map the a algorithm adds to it some heuristics indicating the estimated cost of reaching the destination this function is typically the distance to the destination from the point currently being examinedmany requirements are presented to optimal pathfinding systems optimal does not necessarily mean the shortest the algorithm can take into account such additional factors as the type of the terrain for instance a tank in a rts game will pass the swamp faster going around it than traversing it turning angle limitations the number of enemies in the area and many other elements depending on the particular game the algorithm should avoid uncrossable areas of the map or for example maintain distance from friendly units the foremost requirement is that the algorithm should always be able to find the optimal path as long as a path between the two points exists listing 1 presents the pseudocode describing the a algorithmthe algorithm applied directly may turn out to be ineffective as a result of how much time operations on the structures from the priority queue the openlist and the closedlist can take multiple programming methods exist which work around those imperfections optimisation issues can be approached from two waysin the first case one often applies the method of dividing the whole world map into regions and splitting the algorithm into two sections first we search for the path by checking which regions we should go through then for each region we move from the entry point to the exit within each region we find the optimal path using the a locally for the region we are in that way we significantly limit the search area thus decreasing the amount of resources required for calculationsin fact this method is strongly based on how a human looks for a way to the target – when traveling to another end of a large city a walker doesnt plan the whole route with equal precision instead heshe travels between known orientation points planning precisely the way between each two points up to the street heshe is going to walkanother optimisation factor is the appropriate choice of functions and parameters for heuristics as this is what decides how much the search area spreads over the game mapfinite state machines are one of the least complicated while at the same time one of the most effective and most frequently used methods of programming artificial intelligence for each object in a computer game it is possible to discern a number of states it is in during its life for example a knight can be arming himself patrolling attacking or resting after a battle a peasant can be gathering wood building a house or defending himself against attacks depending on their states ingame objects respond in different ways to the finite set of external stimuli or should there be none perform different activities the finite state machine method lets us easily divide the implementation of each game objects behaviour into smaller fragments which are easier to debug and extend each state possesses code responsible for the initialisation and deinitialisation of the object in that state also often referred to as the state transition code code executed in the games each frame eg to fulfill the needs of artificial intelligence functions or to set an appropriate frame of animation and code for processing and interpreting messages coming from the environmentfinite state machines are typically implemented using one of the two following methodsin the age of objectoriented design and programming the first method is being phased out by the second ie machines implemented on the basis of a project pattern state here is an example of such an objectoriented machine describing the partially possible behaviour of a knight each state of the object is represented by an abstract base classall classes deriving from this class define the behaviour in each state listings 2 3 and 4 an ingame object possesses a pointer to the object of its present states base class and a method assisting the state transition listing 5 a knight class derives from the main object and initialises its default state in the constructorthe issue of artificial neural networks and their applications in video games has become one of the trendiest topics of recent days in the field of computer games a lot has been said for years about their potential applications in computer games in many magazines and on many web portals the “neural networks in computer games” problem has also been discussed multiple times at the gdc game developers conference – an annual event taking place in london and san jose at the same time we had to wait long to see a game enter the market whose engine would run based at least minimally on the potential of the artificial neural network theorythe game collin mcrae rally 2 is one of the first applications of neural networks in computer games which became a total success the trained artificial neural network is responsible for keeping the computer players car on track while letting it negotiate the track as quickly as possible in that game just like i described in the ai in sports games section each track is represented by a set of broken lines making up a graph in a gross simplification the neural networks input parameters are information such as curvature of the roads bend distance from the bend type of surface speed or the vehicles properties it is up to the neural network to generate output data to be passed further to the physical layer module that data being selected in such a way that the car travels and negotiates obstacles or curves at a speed optimal for the given conditions thanks to this the computer players driving style appears contrary to other games of this kind highly natural the computer can avoid small obstacles cut bends begin turning appropriately soon when on a slippery surface etc the game uses the multilayered perceptron model the simplified form of which one can see in figure 6figure 6 the multilayered perceptron modelartificial neural networks could in theory be applied to solving most tasks performed by ai in computer games unfortunately in practice a number of obstacles exist which limit the neural networks application in games these includewhat steps do we need to undertake in order to take advantage of an artificial neural network in a simple computer game let us have a brief lookto begin we have to answer our own question about the kinds of information the neural network should provide us with in order to help us solve the given problem for example let us consider a game in which a neural network controls the flight of our opponents fighter plane the information we should be obtaining from the neural network would then be eg the optimal vectors of velocity and acceleration which when provided to the physics module will guide the enemy fighter to our plane another example could be a neural network used to choose the best strategy in a rtstype game based on situation analysis the network decides how greatly to concentrate on development arms production repairs after battles etc all the parameters required by the game will be provided by the neural network on its outputwhile defining the effect of the neural networks actions is quite easy since we know exactly what we want to achieve choosing the networks input parameters is a much more serious problem the parameters should be chosen in such a way that its different combinations will let the neural network learn to solve complicated situations which havent appeared in the example set of signals the general rule states that the input data variables should represent as much information about the game world as possible it could be for instance vectors of relative positions of the nearest obstacle and the nearest opponent the enemys strength or the present state of armaments and damageanother step is to acquire a set of input data which will be used to train the network the direct method could imply eg remembering several to several hundred samples successful attacks and actions of a human player and providing the recorded data to the neural network typically however the process used is automated ie the samples themselves are computergenerated – which requires an additional often quite significant effort from the programmersthe final step is training the neural network any training algorithm can be used here the training process should be interwoven with simultaneous testing in order to make sure the game is not becoming too difficult or the opposite if its not still too easy and in need of further training and optimisationapplying neural networks practically is not an easy task it requires a lot of time experience and patience in addition neural networks are often used together with fuzzy logic which makes it possible to convert the computers traditional zeroone reasoning into something more strongly resembling the way a human thinks logic lets us decide if and to what degree the given statement is true although simultaneous use of the two technologies is a difficult task when it is successful the results are simply breathtaking and incomparable with what we can achieve by using rules hardcoded into the code with algorithms and traditional logic technologies such as neural networks genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic are the future of computer games – and a future that is not that distant any moredeveloping an advanced artificial intelligence engine requires both time and an experienced team of programmers if a development studio cannot allocate enough human resources to build an artificial intelligence system it has a possibility of purchasing an existing ai system many of which are available in the market here i would like to provide a detailed description of one of the most popular libraries in the market – renderware ai as well as of one of the newer libraries there which could become a less expensive alternative to renderware ai – aiimplantrenderware is a commercial multiplatform computer game engine the renderware engine consists of several modules among them the one of interest to us here – the renderware ai artificial intelligence modulethe renderware module can be used both in games wholly based on the renderware engine and in games which use their own or other engines merely willing to make use of the renderware ai as a basis for an advanced artificial intelligence systemthe renderware ai library follows the layered philosophy of building artificial intelligence systems renderware ai discerns three layersthe most important element of the whole library is representing the perception of the world as this is what further layers of the games ai base on in renderware ai this module is called pathdata a slightly misleading name considering path analysis is only one of the perception modules functions and uses the tool called pathdata generator the pathdata module can successfully analyse the game world with respect to its topological properties with the streaming method it features making it possible to generate information required for the ai module even for very large game maps pathdata conducts both a global analysis of the terrains topology and an analysis of the units nearest surroundings the results of the analysis can then be if such a need arises subject to further manual processingglobal analysis provides such information as the place on the map interesting from the point of view of its topological properties this information can include data about wellhidden locations on the map locations from which large areas of the map can be seen well where a camera could be placed so that its view wont be obscured by a minor element of the scene etc local analysis can let us detect walls obstacles which have to be walked around or jumped over and a lot of other locally important elementsrenderware ais another important feature is the module responsible for the function of widely understood planning and the execution of the movement of units using data provided by the world analysis module an appropriate graph is built which is then used by the a algorithm to preliminary plan the optimal path from point a to point b other features include unit typedependent paths path smoothing avoiding dynamic objects getting into the units way coordination with the animation system and many others extremely important in practicethe engine is available for many platforms from sony playstation through nintendo or xbox to sony playstation 2 and pcs the libraries are optimised for each platform and make it possible to create incredibly advanced ai systems it is worth considering as an alternative to timeconsuming development of ones own solutions for the field of artificial intelligencethis engine demonstrated for the first time in 2002 at the game developers conference immediately peaked the wide interest of computer game developers the most important features of this system include advanced hierarchic algorithms of path planning a decision module based on binary decision trees and a friendly user interface enabling their edition in addition one of its great advantages is close integration with such programs as 3dstudio max and maya which allows intuitive manipulation of data controlling object behaviour as early as at the stage of their development in graphical packages among many other properties of the aiimplant package one worth mentioning is an advanced group behaviour module making it possible to very realistically simulate crowds aiimplant is a multiplatform package available for pc gamecube xbox and sony playstation architecturesartificial intelligence is a very broad and at the same time fascinating part of computer science in this article i have introduced the reader to certain algorithms and methods of artificial intelligence used in programming computer games however it is only a small fragment of the knowledge any real computer game programmer must master the most important issues not having been discussed here include genetic programming fuzzy logic impact map method flock algorithms and many many others getting familiar with these i heartily recommend to all the readers at the end im providing a list of books and web page references which can be useful to anyone who would like to

while discussing the evolution of artificial intelligence in computer games one definitely should mention the games which have turned out to be milestones in the development of intelligent behaviour in games one of the most popular games of the 1990s was warcraft – a game developed by the blizzard studio it was the first game to employ pathfinding algorithms at such a grand scale for hundreds of units in the game engaged in massive battles simcity created by the company maxis was the first game to prove the feasibility of using alife technologies in the field of computer games another milestone turned out to be the game blackwhite created in 2001 by lionhead studios in which technologies of computercontrolled characters learning were used for the first time ai in fpstype games fpstype games usually implement the layered structure of the artificial intelligence system layers located at the very bottom handle the most elementary tasks such as determining the optimal path to the target determined by a layer higher up in the hierarchy or playing appropriate sequences of character animation the higher levels are responsible for tactical reasoning and selecting the behaviour which an ai agent should assume in accordance with its present strategy pathfinding systems are usually based on graphs describing the world each vertex of a graph represents a logical location such as a room in the building or a fragment of the battlefield when ordered to travel to a given point the ai agent acquires using the graphs subsequent navigation points it should consecutively head towards in order to reach the specified target location moving between navigation points the ai system can also use local paths which make it possible to determine an exact path between two navigation points as well as to avoid dynamically appearing obstacles the animation system plays an appropriate sequence of animation at the chosen speed it should also be able to play different animation sequences for different body parts for example a soldier can run and aim at the enemy and shoot and reload the weapon while still running games of this kind often employ the inverted kinematics system an ik animation system can appropriately calculate the parameters of arm positioning animation so that the hand can grab an object located on eg a table or a shelf the task of modules from higher layers is to choose the behaviour appropriate for the situation – for instance whether the agent should patrol the area enter combat or run through the map in search of an opponent once the ai system has decided which behaviour is the most appropriate for the given situation a lowerlevel module has to select the best tactics for fulfilling that task having received information that the agent should for instance fight it tries to determine the approach that is the best at the moment – eg whether we should sneak up on the opponent hide in a corner and wait for the opponent to present a target of itself or perhaps just run at him shooting blindly ai in rtstype games in rtstype games it is possible to distinguish several modules of the artificial intelligence system and its layered structure one of the basic modules is an effective pathfinding system – sometimes it has to find a movement solution for hundreds of units on the map in split seconds – and there is more to it than merely finding a path from point a to point b as it is also important to detect collisions and handle the units in the battlefield avoid each other such algorithms are typically based on the game map being represented by a rectangular grid with its mesh representing fixedsized elements of the area on higher levels of the ai systems hierarchy there are modules responsible for economy development or very importantly a module to analyse the game map it is that module which analyses the properties of the terrain and a settlement is built based on the assessment eg whether the settlement is located on an island thus requiring higher pressure on building a navy the terrain analyser decides when cities should be built and how fortifications should be placed figure 1 representation of the world in a rtstype game figure 2 representation of the world in a fpstype game ai in sports games basically in the case of most sports games we are dealing with largescale cheating take car racing games for instance for the needs of the ai from the geometry of the game map only and only the polygons belonging to the track of a computercontrolled opponent should travel on and get distinguished two curves are then marked on that track the first represents the optimal driving track the second – the track used when overtaking opponents the whole track gets split into appropriately small sectors and having taken parameters of the surface into account each element of the split track gets its length calculated those fragments are then used to build a graph describing the track and to obtain characteristics of the road in the vehicles closest vicinity in effect the computer knows it should slow down because its approaching the curve or knows that its approaching an intersection and can eg take a shortcut two important attributes of artificial intelligence systems in such games is being able to analyse the terrain in order to detect obstacles lying on the road and strict cooperation with the physics module the physics module can provide information that the car is skidding having received which the artificial intelligence system should react appropriately and try to get the vehicles traction back under control figure 3 the method of presentation of reality in car race segmentation and optimalisation of the track figure 4 the method of presentation of reality in car race similar cheating can also be found in other sports games in most cases a computercontrolled player has its complete behaviour determined even before the beginning of the turn – that is it will eg fall over while landing acrobatics ski jumping etc have the wrong velocity start false etc additionally in games simulating sports with scoring by judges the scores are generated according to the rules defined by the appropriate sports bodies the predefined scenario of a computercontrolled player is then acted out by the character animation system the most popular ai algorithms in computer games in the following part of the article i would like to discuss the two most popular algorithms used in programming computer games possessing knowledge about them one can successfully design a simple artificial intelligence system fulfilling the needs of simple fps or rts games the first of the two is the astar algorithm used in performing fast searches for the optimal path connecting two points on the map graph of a game the other is the finite state machine useful eg in preparing behaviour scenarios for computercontrolled opponents typically delegating its lowlevel tasks to a pathfinding module the a algorithm the problem of finding a way from point a to point b on a map is a key problem in almost any computer game possibly not counting certain sports games and some other types of games which can be counted using the digits of one hand at the same time algorithms from this group belong to the lower level of the games ai serving as a base for constructing more complicated and more intelligent types of behaviour such as strategic planning moving in formations or groups and many others this issue has already been thoroughly evaluated in the world of computer games with one algorithm – a – having become a presentday standard representation of the world of the game the world of almost any computer game can be represented with a graph its form depending on the kind of the game in rtstype games the world is typically represented by a twodimensional array each of its elements corresponding to fragments of the game worlds rectangular map each element except boundary ones has eight neighbours using such a representation of the rts world we can construct a graph in which every element of the 2d array will be corresponded to by one vertex of the graph the edges of the graph typically present only between the nearest neighbours illustrate the possibility or lack thereof of moving from one of the elements of the map to the neighbouring element in realtime strategies we usually assign one vertex of the graph to an area the smallest unit in the game can fit into in fpstype games the vertices of the graph are typically locationsrooms with the graphs vertices denoting the existence of a direct connection between the two rooms choosing an algorithm there are a lot of algorithms for finding the optimal path in a graph the most simple of such algorithms commonly called fire on the prairie works by constructing consecutive circles around the starting point with each step of the algorithm building another wider circle consecutive circles and elements belonging to them are assigned larger and larger indices as one can see in figure 5 the circle with index 4 passes through our target point figure 5 a simple pathfinding algorithm now heading in the opposite direction and following the rule that in each step we move to the nearest map point located on the circle with a smaller index we reach the starting point the elements of our map we have returned through make up the shortest path between the starting point and the destination examining the way this algorithm works one can see that in addition to its great advantage – the simplicity – it also possesses a severe drawback the path the algorithm has found in our example consists of only five elements of the game world even though 81 fields of the map would have to be examined in the worstcase scenario in case of a map consisting of 256x256 fields it might mean having to examine 65536 map elements enter a and its primary advantage – minimisation of areas being examined by consciously orienting the search towards the target keeping it brief i could say that when calculating the cost of reaching a point on the map the a algorithm adds to it some heuristics indicating the estimated cost of reaching the destination this function is typically the distance to the destination from the point currently being examined requirements for the algorithm many requirements are presented to optimal pathfinding systems optimal does not necessarily mean the shortest the algorithm can take into account such additional factors as the type of the terrain for instance a tank in a rts game will pass the swamp faster going around it than traversing it turning angle limitations the number of enemies in the area and many other elements depending on the particular game the algorithm should avoid uncrossable areas of the map or for example maintain distance from friendly units the foremost requirement is that the algorithm should always be able to find the optimal path as long as a path between the two points exists listing 1 presents the pseudocode describing the a algorithm listing 1 the a algorithmpriorityqueue openlist list closedlist startnodeg 0 startnodeh

yet add succ to openlist closedlistinsertnode return false optimisation the algorithm applied directly may turn out to be ineffective as a result of how much time operations on the structures from the priority queue the openlist and the closedlist can take multiple programming methods exist which work around those imperfections optimisation issues can be approached from two ways optimising the search algorithm itself optimising the data structures in the first case one often applies the method of dividing the whole world map into regions and splitting the algorithm into two sections first we search for the path by checking which regions we should go through then for each region we move from the entry point to the exit within each region we find the optimal path using the a locally for the region we are in that way we significantly limit the search area thus decreasing the amount of resources required for calculations in fact this method is strongly based on how a human looks for a way to the target – when traveling to another end of a large city a walker doesnt plan the whole route with equal precision instead heshe travels between known orientation points planning precisely the way between each two points up to the street heshe is going to walk another optimisation factor is the appropriate choice of functions and parameters for heuristics as this is what decides how much the search area spreads over the game map finite state machines finite state machines are one of the least complicated while at the same time one of the most effective and most frequently used methods of programming artificial intelligence for each object in a computer game it is possible to discern a number of states it is in during its life for example a knight can be arming himself patrolling attacking or resting after a battle a peasant can be gathering wood building a house or defending himself against attacks depending on their states ingame objects respond in different ways to the finite set of external stimuli or should there be none perform different activities the finite state machine method lets us easily divide the implementation of each game objects behaviour into smaller fragments which are easier to debug and extend each state possesses code responsible for the initialisation and deinitialisation of the object in that state also often referred to as the state transition code code executed in the games each frame eg to fulfill the needs of artificial intelligence functions or to set an appropriate frame of animation and code for processing and interpreting messages coming from the environment finite state machines are typically implemented using one of the two following methods finite state machine language – implemented in c as a set of preprocessor macros state design pattern – a special objectoriented project pattern in the age of objectoriented design and programming the first method is being phased out by the second ie machines implemented on the basis of a project pattern state here is an example of such an objectoriented machine describing the partially possible behaviour of a knight each state of the object is represented by an abstract

become one of the trendiest topics of recent days in the field of computer games a lot has been said for years about their potential applications in computer games in many magazines and on many web portals the “neural networks in computer games” problem has also been discussed multiple times at the gdc game developers conference – an annual event taking place in london and san jose at the same time we had to wait long to see a game enter the market whose engine would run based at least minimally on the potential of the artificial neural network theory the game collin mcrae rally 2 is one of the first applications of neural networks in computer games which became a total success the trained artificial neural network is responsible for keeping the computer players car on track while letting it negotiate the track as quickly as possible in that game just like i described in the ai in sports games section each track is represented by a set of broken lines making up a graph in a gross simplification the neural networks input parameters are information such as curvature of the roads bend distance from the bend type of surface speed or the vehicles properties it is up to the neural network to generate output data to be passed further to the physical layer module that data being selected in such a way that the car travels and negotiates obstacles or curves at a speed optimal for the given conditions thanks to this the computer players driving style appears contrary to other games of this kind highly natural the computer can avoid small obstacles cut bends begin turning appropriately soon when on a slippery surface etc the game uses the multilayered perceptron model the simplified form of which one can see in figure 6 figure 6 the multilayered perceptron model artificial neural networks could in theory be applied to solving most tasks performed by ai in computer games unfortunately in practice a number of obstacles exist which limit the neural networks application in games these include problems with choosing the appropriate input for neural networks neural networks sensitivity to changes in a games action logic and the need for retraining the network whenever such a situation occurs rather complicated theory and difficulties with debugging in case of problems timeconsuming and complicated process of training the network what steps do we need to undertake in order to take advantage of an artificial neural network in a simple computer game let us have a brief look to begin we have to answer our own question about the kinds of information the neural network should provide us with in order to help us solve the given problem for example let us consider a game in which a neural network controls the flight of our opponents fighter plane the information we should be obtaining from the neural network would then be eg the optimal vectors of velocity and acceleration which when provided to the physics module will guide the enemy fighter to our plane another example could be a neural network used to choose the best strategy in a rtstype game based on situation analysis the network decides how greatly to concentrate on development arms production repairs after battles etc all the parameters required by the game will be provided by the neural network on its output while defining the effect of the neural networks actions is quite easy since we know exactly what we want to achieve choosing the networks input parameters is a much more serious problem the parameters should be chosen in such a way that its different combinations will let the neural network learn to solve complicated situations which havent appeared in the example set of signals the general rule states that the input data variables should represent as much information about the game world as possible it could be for instance vectors of relative positions of the nearest obstacle and the nearest opponent the enemys strength or the present state of armaments and damage another step is to acquire a set of input data which will be used to train the network the direct method could imply eg remembering several to several hundred samples successful attacks and actions of a human player and providing the recorded data to the neural network typically however the process used is automated ie the samples themselves are computergenerated – which requires an additional often quite significant effort from the programmers the final step is training the neural network any training algorithm can be used here the training process should be interwoven with simultaneous testing in order to make sure the game is not becoming too difficult or the opposite if its not still too easy and in need of further training and optimisation applying neural networks practically is not an easy task it requires a lot of time experience and patience in addition neural networks are often used together with fuzzy logic which makes it possible to convert the computers traditional zeroone reasoning into something more strongly resembling the way a human thinks logic lets us decide if and to what degree the given statement is true although simultaneous use of the two technologies is a difficult task when it is successful the results are simply breathtaking and incomparable with what we can achieve by using rules hardcoded into the code with algorithms and traditional logic technologies such as neural networks genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic are the future of computer games – and a future that is not that distant any more ai libraries developing an advanced artificial intelligence engine requires both time and an experienced team of programmers if a development studio cannot allocate enough human resources to build an artificial intelligence system it has a possibility of purchasing an existing ai system many of which are available in the market here i would like to provide a detailed description of one of the most popular libraries in the market – renderware ai as well as of one of the newer libraries there which could become a less expensive alternative to renderware ai – aiimplant renderware ai renderware is a commercial multiplatform computer game engine the renderware engine consists of several modules among them the one of interest to us here – the renderware ai artificial intelligence module the renderware module can be used both in games wholly based on the renderware engine and in games which use their own or other engines merely willing to make use of the renderware ai as a basis for an advanced artificial intelligence system the renderware ai library follows the layered philosophy of building artificial intelligence systems renderware ai discerns three layers the perception layer responsible for situation analysis – primarily for analysing the static eg terrain and dynamic enemies elevators etc surroundings the decision layer responsible for making strategic decisions basing on the information provided by the perception module lowlevel actions such as attacking pathfinding evasions etc are executed by the action module the action layer the most important element of the whole library is representing the perception of the world as this is what further layers of the games ai base on in renderware ai this module is called pathdata a slightly misleading name considering path analysis is only one of the perception modules functions and uses the tool called pathdata generator the pathdata module can successfully analyse the game world with respect to its topological properties with the streaming method it features making it possible to generate information required for the ai module even for very large game maps pathdata conducts both a global analysis of the terrains topology and an analysis of the units nearest surroundings the results of the analysis can then be if such a need arises subject to further manual processing global analysis provides such information as the place on the map interesting from the point of view of its topological properties this information can include data about wellhidden locations on the map locations from which large areas of the map can be seen well where a camera could be placed so that its view wont be obscured by a minor element of the scene etc local analysis can let us detect walls obstacles which have to be walked around or jumped over and a lot of other locally important elements renderware ais another important feature is the module responsible for the function of widely understood planning and the execution of the movement of units using data provided by the world analysis module an appropriate graph is built which is then used by the a algorithm to preliminary plan the optimal path from point a to point b other features include unit typedependent paths path smoothing avoiding dynamic objects getting into the units way coordination with the animation system and many others extremely important in practice the engine is available for many platforms from sony playstation through nintendo or xbox to sony playstation 2 and pcs the libraries are optimised for each platform and make it possible to create incredibly advanced ai systems it is worth considering as an alternative to timeconsuming development of ones own solutions for the field of artificial intelligence aiimplant this engine demonstrated for the first time in 2002 at the game developers conference immediately peaked the wide interest of computer game developers the most important features of this system include advanced hierarchic algorithms of path planning a decision module based on binary decision trees and a friendly user interface enabling their edition in addition one of its great advantages is close integration with such programs as 3dstudio max and maya which allows intuitive manipulation of data controlling object behaviour as early as at the stage of their development in graphical packages among many other properties of the aiimplant package one worth mentioning is an advanced group behaviour module making it possible to very realistically simulate crowds aiimplant is a multiplatform package available for pc gamecube xbox and sony playstation architectures what now artificial intelligence is a very broad and at the same time fascinating part of computer science in this article i have introduced the reader to certain algorithms and methods of artificial intelligence used in programming computer games however it is only a small fragment of the knowledge any real computer game programmer must master the most important issues not having been discussed here include genetic programming fuzzy logic impact map method flock algorithms and many many others getting familiar with these i heartily recommend to all the readers at the end im providing a list of books and web page references which can be useful to anyone who would like to singlehandedly increase ones knowledge of

0.6	{'title': 'basic questions', 'h1': 'basic questions', 'p': 'basic questions q what is artificial intelligence a it is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines especially intelligent computer programs it is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence but ai does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable q yes but what is intelligence a intelligence is the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world varying kinds and degrees of intelligence occur in people many animals and some machines q isnt there a solid definition of intelligence that doesnt depend on relating it to human intelligence a not yet the problem is that we cannot yet characterize in general what kinds of computational procedures we want to call intelligent we understand some of the mechanisms of intelligence and not others q is intelligence a single thing so that one can ask a yes or no question is this machine intelligent or not a no intelligence involves mechanisms and ai research has discovered how to make computers carry out some of them and not others if doing a task requires only mechanisms that are well understood today computer programs can give very impressive performances on these tasks such programs should be considered somewhat intelligent q isnt ai about simulating human intelligence a sometimes but not always or even usually on the one hand we can learn something about how to make machines solve problems by observing other people or just by observing our own methods on the other hand most work in ai involves studying the problems the world presents to intelligence rather than studying people or animals ai researchers are free to use methods that are not observed in people or that involve much more computing than people can do q what about iq do computer programs have iqs a no iq is based on the rates at which intelligence develops in children it is the ratio of the age at which a child normally makes a certain score to the childs age the scale is extended to adults in a suitable way iq correlates well with various measures of success or failure in life but making computers that can score high on iq tests would be weakly correlated with their usefulness for example the ability of a child to repeat back a long sequence of digits correlates well with other intellectual abilities perhaps because it measures how much information the child can compute with at once however digit span is trivial for even extremely limited computers however some of the problems on iq tests are useful challenges for ai q what about other comparisons between human and computer intelligence arthur r jensen jen98 a leading researcher in human intelligence suggests as a heuristic hypothesis that all normal humans have the same intellectual mechanisms and that differences in intelligence are related to quantitative biochemical and physiological conditions i see them as speed short term memory and the ability to form accurate and retrievable long term memories whether or not jensen is right about human intelligence the situation in ai today is the reverse computer programs have plenty of speed and memory but their abilities correspond to the intellectual mechanisms that program designers understand well enough to put in programs some abilities that children normally dont develop till they are teenagers may be in and some abilities possessed by two year olds are still out the matter is further complicated by the fact that the cognitive sciences still have not succeeded in determining exactly what the human abilities are very likely the organization of the intellectual mechanisms for ai can usefully be different from that in people whenever people do better than computers on some task or computers use a lot of computation to do as well as people this demonstrates that the program designers lack understanding of the intellectual mechanisms required to do the task efficiently q when did ai research start a after wwii a number of people independently started to work on intelligent machines the english mathematician alan turing may have been the first he gave a lecture on it in 1947 he also may have been the first to decide that ai was best researched by programming computers rather than by building machines by the late 1950s there were many researchers on ai and most of them were basing their work on programming computers q does ai aim to put the human mind into the computer a some researchers say they have that objective but maybe they are using the phrase metaphorically the human mind has a lot of peculiarities and im not sure anyone is serious about imitating all of them q what is the turing test a alan turings 1950 article computing machinery and intelligence tur50 discussed conditions for considering a machine to be intelligent he argued that if the machine could successfully pretend to be human to a knowledgeable observer then you certainly should consider it intelligent this test would satisfy most people but not all philosophers the observer could interact with the machine and a human by teletype to avoid requiring that the machine imitate the appearance or voice of the person and the human would try to persuade the observer that it was human and the machine would try to fool the observer the turing test is a onesided test a machine that passes the test should certainly be considered intelligent but a machine could still be considered intelligent without knowing enough about humans to imitate a human daniel dennetts book brainchildren den98 has an excellent discussion of the turing test and the various partial turing tests that have been implemented ie with restrictions on the observers knowledge of ai and the subject matter of questioning it turns out that some people are easily led into believing that a rather dumb program is intelligent q does ai aim at humanlevel intelligence a yes the ultimate effort is to make computer programs that can solve problems and achieve goals in the world as well as humans however many people involved in particular research areas are much less ambitious q how far is ai from reaching humanlevel intelligence when will it happen a a few people think that humanlevel intelligence can be achieved by writing large numbers of programs of the kind people are now writing and assembling vast knowledge bases of facts in the languages now used for expressing knowledge however most ai researchers believe that new fundamental ideas are required and therefore it cannot be predicted when humanlevel intelligence will be achieved q are computers the right kind of machine to be made intelligent a computers can be programmed to simulate any kind of machine many researchers invented noncomputer machines hoping that they would be intelligent in different ways than the computer programs could be however they usually simulate their invented machines on a computer and come to doubt that the new machine is worth building because many billions of dollars that have been spent in making computers faster and faster another kind of machine would have to be very fast to perform better than a program on a computer simulating the machine q are computers fast enough to be intelligent a some people think much faster computers are required as well as new ideas my own opinion is that the computers of 30 years ago were fast enough if only we knew how to program them of course quite apart from the ambitions of ai researchers computers will keep getting faster q what about parallel machines a machines with many processors are much faster than single processors can be parallelism itself presents no advantages and parallel machines are somewhat awkward to program when extreme speed is required it is necessary to face this awkwardness q what about making a child machine that could improve by reading and by learning from experience a this idea has been proposed many times starting in the 1940s eventually it will be made to work however ai programs havent yet reached the level of being able to learn much of what a child learns from physical experience nor do present programs understand language well enough to learn much by reading q might an ai system be able to bootstrap itself to higher and higher level intelligence by thinking about ai a i think yes but we arent yet at a level of ai at which this process can begin q what about chess a alexander kronrod a russian ai researcher said chess is the drosophila of ai he was making an analogy with geneticists use of that fruit fly to study inheritance playing chess requires certain intellectual mechanisms and not others chess programs now play at grandmaster level but they do it with limited intellectual mechanisms compared to those used by a human chess player substituting large amounts of computation for understanding once we understand these mechanisms better we can build humanlevel chess programs that do far less computation than do present programs unfortunately the competitive and commercial aspects of making computers play chess have taken precedence over using chess as a scientific domain it is as if the geneticists after 1910 had organized fruit fly races and concentrated their efforts on breeding fruit flies that could win these races q what about go a the chinese and japanese game of go is also a board game in which the players take turns moving go exposes the weakness of our present understanding of the intellectual mechanisms involved in human game playing go programs are very bad players in spite of considerable effort not as much as for chess the problem seems to be that a position in go has to be divided mentally into a collection of subpositions which are first analyzed separately followed by an analysis of their interaction humans use this in chess also but chess programs consider the position as a whole chess programs compensate for the lack of this intellectual mechanism by doing thousands or in the case of deep blue many millions of times as much computation sooner or later ai research will overcome this scandalous weakness q dont some people say that ai is a bad idea a the philosopher john searle says that the idea of a nonbiological machine being intelligent is incoherent he proposes the chinese room argument wwwformalstanfordedujmcchinesehtml the philosopher hubert dreyfus says that ai is impossible the computer scientist joseph weizenbaum says the idea is obscene antihuman and immoral various people have said that since artificial intelligence hasnt reached human level by now it must be impossible still other people are disappointed that companies they invested in went bankrupt q arent computability theory and computational complexity the keys to ai note to the layman and beginners in computer science these are quite technical branches of mathematical logic and computer science and the answer to the question has to be somewhat technical a no these theories are relevant but dont address the fundamental problems of ai in the 1930s mathematical logicians especially kurt gödel and alan turing established that there did not exist algorithms that were guaranteed to solve all problems in certain important mathematical domains whether a sentence of first order logic is a theorem is one example and whether a polynomial equations in several variables has integer solutions is another humans solve problems in these domains all the time and this has been offered as an argument usually with some decorations that computers are intrinsically incapable of doing what people do roger penrose claims this however people cant guarantee to solve arbitrary problems in these domains either see my review of the emperors new mind by roger penrose more essays and reviews defending ai research are in mcc96a in the 1960s computer scientists especially steve cook and richard karp developed the theory of npcomplete problem domains problems in these domains are solvable but seem to take time exponential in the size of the problem which sentences of propositional calculus are satisfiable is a basic example of an npcomplete problem domain humans often solve problems in npcomplete domains in times much shorter than is guaranteed by the general algorithms but cant solve them quickly in general what is important for ai is to have algorithms as capable as people at solving problems the identification of subdomains for which good algorithms exist is important but a lot of ai problem solvers are not associated with readily identified subdomains the theory of the difficulty of general classes of problems is called computational complexity so far this theory hasnt interacted with ai as much as might have been hoped success in problem solving by humans and by ai programs seems to rely on properties of problems and problem solving methods that the neither the complexity researchers nor the ai community have been able to identify precisely algorithmic complexity theory as developed by solomonoff kolmogorov and chaitin independently of one another is also relevant it defines the complexity of a symbolic object as the length of the shortest program that will generate it proving that a candidate program is the shortest or close to the shortest is an unsolvable problem but representing objects by short programs that generate them should sometimes be illuminating even when you cant prove that the program is the shortest next branches

people or animals ai researchers are free to use methods that are not observed in people or that involve much more computing than people can do q what about iq do computer programs have iqs a no iq is based on the rates at which intelligence develops in children it is the ratio of the age at which a child normally makes a certain score to the childs age the scale is extended to adults in a suitable way iq correlates well with various measures of success or failure in life but making computers that can score high on iq tests would be weakly correlated with their usefulness for example the ability of a child to repeat back a long sequence of digits correlates well with other intellectual abilities perhaps because it measures how much information the child can compute with at once however digit span is trivial for even extremely limited computers however some of the problems on iq tests are useful challenges for ai q what about other comparisons between human and computer intelligence arthur r jensen jen98 a leading researcher in human intelligence suggests as a heuristic hypothesis that all normal humans have the same intellectual mechanisms and that differences in intelligence are related to quantitative biochemical and physiological conditions i see them as speed short term memory and the ability to form accurate and retrievable long term memories whether or not jensen is right about human intelligence the situation in ai today is the reverse computer programs have plenty of speed and memory but their abilities correspond to the intellectual mechanisms that program designers understand well enough to put in programs some abilities that children normally dont develop till they are teenagers may be in and some abilities possessed by two year olds are still out the matter is further complicated by the fact that the cognitive sciences still have not succeeded in determining exactly what the human abilities are very likely the organization of the intellectual mechanisms for ai can usefully be different from that in people whenever people do better than computers on some task or computers use a lot of computation to do as well as people this demonstrates that the program designers lack understanding of the intellectual mechanisms required to do the task efficiently q when did ai research start a after wwii a number of people independently started to work on intelligent machines the english mathematician alan turing may have been the first he gave a lecture on it in 1947 he also may have been the first to decide that ai was best researched by programming computers rather than by building machines by the late 1950s there were many researchers on ai and most of them were basing their work on programming computers q does ai aim to put the human mind into the computer a some researchers say they have that objective but maybe they are using the phrase metaphorically the human mind has a lot of peculiarities and im not sure anyone is serious about imitating all of them q what is the turing test a alan turings 1950 article computing machinery and intelligence tur50 discussed conditions for considering a machine to be intelligent he argued that if the machine could successfully pretend to be human to a knowledgeable observer then you certainly should consider it intelligent this test would satisfy most people but not all philosophers the observer could interact with the machine and a human by teletype to avoid requiring that the machine imitate the appearance or voice of the person and the human would try to persuade the observer that it was human and the machine would try to fool the observer the turing test is a onesided test a machine that passes the test should certainly be considered intelligent but a machine could still be considered intelligent without knowing enough about humans to imitate a human daniel dennetts book brainchildren den98 has an excellent discussion of the turing test and the various partial turing tests that have been implemented ie with restrictions on the observers knowledge of ai and the subject matter of questioning it turns out that some people are easily led into believing that a rather dumb program is intelligent q does ai aim at humanlevel intelligence a yes the ultimate effort is to make computer programs that can solve problems and achieve goals in the world as well as humans however many people involved in particular research areas are much less ambitious q how far is ai from reaching humanlevel intelligence when will it happen a a few people think that humanlevel intelligence can be achieved by writing large numbers of programs of the kind people are now writing and assembling vast knowledge bases of facts in the languages now used for expressing knowledge however most ai researchers believe that new fundamental ideas are required and therefore it cannot be predicted when humanlevel intelligence will be achieved q are computers the right kind of machine to be made intelligent a computers can be programmed to simulate any kind of machine many researchers invented noncomputer machines hoping that they would be intelligent in different ways than the computer programs could be however they usually simulate their invented machines on a computer and come to doubt that the new machine is worth building because many billions of dollars that have been spent in making computers faster and faster another kind of machine would have to be very fast to perform better than a program on a computer simulating the machine q are computers fast enough to be intelligent a some people think much faster computers are required as well as new ideas my own opinion is that the computers of 30 years ago were fast enough if only we knew how to program them of course quite apart from the ambitions of ai researchers computers will keep getting faster q what about parallel machines a machines with many processors are much faster than single processors can be parallelism itself presents no advantages and parallel machines are somewhat awkward to program when extreme speed is required it is necessary to face this awkwardness q what about making a child machine that could improve by reading and by learning from experience a this idea has been proposed many times starting in the 1940s eventually it will be made to work however ai programs havent yet reached the level of being able to learn much of what a child learns from physical experience nor do present programs understand language well enough to learn much by reading q might an ai system be able to bootstrap itself to higher and higher level intelligence by thinking about ai a i think yes but we arent yet at a level of ai at which this process can begin q what about chess a alexander kronrod a russian ai researcher said chess is the drosophila of ai he was making an analogy with geneticists use of that fruit fly to study inheritance playing chess requires certain intellectual mechanisms and not others chess programs now play at grandmaster level but they do it with limited intellectual mechanisms compared to those used by a human chess player substituting large amounts of computation for understanding once we understand these mechanisms better we can build humanlevel chess programs that do far less computation than do present programs unfortunately the competitive and commercial aspects of making computers play chess have taken precedence over using chess as a scientific domain it is as if the geneticists after 1910 had organized fruit fly races and concentrated their efforts on breeding fruit flies that could win these races q what about go a the chinese and japanese game of go is also a board game in which the players take turns moving go exposes the weakness of our present understanding of the intellectual mechanisms involved in human game playing go programs are very bad players in spite of considerable effort not as much as for chess the problem seems to be that a position in go has to be divided mentally into a collection of subpositions which are first analyzed separately followed by an analysis of their interaction humans use this in chess also but chess programs consider the position as a whole chess programs compensate for the lack of this intellectual mechanism by doing thousands or in the case of deep blue many millions of times as much computation sooner or later ai research will overcome this scandalous weakness q dont some people say that ai is a bad idea a the philosopher john searle says that the idea of a nonbiological machine being intelligent is incoherent he proposes the chinese room argument wwwformalstanfordedujmcchinesehtml the philosopher hubert dreyfus says that ai is impossible the computer scientist joseph weizenbaum says the idea is obscene antihuman and immoral various people have said that since artificial intelligence hasnt reached human level by now it must be impossible still other people are disappointed that companies they invested in went bankrupt q arent computability theory and computational complexity the keys to ai note to the layman and beginners in computer science these are quite technical branches of mathematical logic and computer science and the answer to the question has to be somewhat technical a no these theories are relevant but dont address the fundamental problems of ai in the 1930s mathematical logicians especially kurt gödel and alan turing established that there did not exist algorithms that were guaranteed to solve all problems in certain important mathematical domains whether a sentence of first order logic is a theorem is one example and whether a polynomial equations in several variables has integer solutions is another humans solve problems in these domains all the time and this has been offered as an argument usually with some decorations that computers are intrinsically incapable of doing what people do roger penrose claims this however people cant guarantee to solve arbitrary problems in these domains either see my review of the emperors new mind by roger penrose more essays and reviews defending ai research are in mcc96a in the 1960s computer scientists especially steve cook and richard karp developed the theory of npcomplete problem domains problems in these domains are solvable but seem to take time exponential in the size of the problem which sentences of propositional calculus are satisfiable is a basic example of an npcomplete problem domain humans often solve problems in npcomplete domains in times much shorter than is guaranteed by the general algorithms but cant solve them quickly in general what is important for ai is to have algorithms as capable as people at solving problems the identification of subdomains for which good algorithms exist is important but a lot of ai problem solvers are not associated with readily identified subdomains the theory of the difficulty of general classes of problems is called computational complexity so far this theory hasnt interacted with ai as much as might have been hoped success in problem solving by humans and by ai programs seems to rely on properties of problems and problem solving methods that the neither the complexity researchers nor the ai community have been able to identify precisely algorithmic complexity theory as developed by solomonoff kolmogorov and chaitin independently of one another is also relevant it defines the complexity of a symbolic object as the length of the shortest program that will generate it proving that a candidate program is the shortest or close to the shortest is an unsolvable problem but representing objects by short programs that generate them should sometimes be illuminating even when you cant prove that the program is the shortest next branches of ai up what is artificial intelligence previous what is artificial intelligence john mccarthy 20071112a intelligence is the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world varying kinds and degrees of intelligence occur in people many animals and some machines q isnt there a solid definition of intelligence that doesnt depend on relating it to human intelligence a not yet the problem is that we cannot yet characterize in general what kinds of computational procedures we want to call intelligent we understand some of the mechanisms of intelligence and not others q is intelligence a single thing so that one can ask a yes or no question is this machine intelligent or not a no intelligence involves mechanisms and ai research has discovered how to make computers carry out some of them and not others if doing a task requires only mechanisms that are well understood today computer programs can give very impressive performances on these tasks such programs should be considered somewhat intelligent q isnt ai about simulating human intelligence a sometimes but not always

humanlevel intelligence can be achieved by writing large numbers of programs of the kind people are now writing and assembling vast knowledge bases of facts in the languages now used for expressing knowledge however most ai researchers believe that new fundamental ideas are required and therefore it cannot be predicted when humanlevel intelligence will be achieved q are computers the right kind of machine to be made intelligent a computers can be programmed to simulate any kind of machine many researchers invented noncomputer machines hoping that they would be intelligent in different ways than the computer programs could be however they usually simulate their invented machines on a computer and come to doubt that the new machine is worth building because many billions of dollars that have been spent in making computers faster and faster another kind of machine would have to be very fast to perform better than a program on a computer simulating the machine q are computers fast enough to be intelligent a some people think much faster computers are required as well as new ideas my own opinion is that the computers of 30 years ago were fast enough if only we knew how to program them of course quite apart from the ambitions of ai researchers computers will keep getting faster q what about parallel machines a machines with many processors are much faster than single processors can be parallelism itself presents no advantages and parallel machines are somewhat awkward to program when extreme speed is required it is necessary to face this awkwardness q what about making a child machine that could improve by reading and by learning from experience a this idea has been proposed many times starting in the 1940s eventually it will be made to work however ai programs havent yet reached the level of being able to learn much of what a child learns from physical experience nor do present programs understand language well enough to learn much by reading q might an ai system be able to bootstrap itself to higher and higher level intelligence by thinking about ai a i think yes but we arent yet at a level of ai at which this process can begin q what about chess a alexander kronrod a russian ai researcher said chess is the drosophila of ai he was making an analogy with geneticists use of that fruit fly to study inheritance playing chess requires certain intellectual mechanisms and not others chess programs now play at grandmaster level but they do it with limited intellectual mechanisms compared to those used by a human chess player substituting large amounts of computation for understanding once we understand these mechanisms better we can build humanlevel chess programs that do far less computation than do present programs unfortunately the competitive and commercial aspects of making computers play chess have taken precedence over using chess as a scientific domain it is as if the geneticists after 1910 had organized fruit fly races and concentrated their efforts on breeding fruit flies that could win these races q what about go a the chinese and japanese game of go is also a board game in which the players take turns moving go exposes the weakness of our present understanding of the intellectual mechanisms involved in human game playing go programs are very bad players in spite of considerable effort not as much as for chess the problem seems to be that a position in go has to be divided mentally into a collection of subpositions which are first analyzed separately followed by an analysis of their interaction humans use this in chess also but chess programs consider the position as a whole chess programs compensate for the lack of this intellectual mechanism by doing thousands or in the case of deep blue many millions of times as much computation sooner or later ai research will overcome this scandalous weakness q dont some people say that ai is a bad idea a the philosopher john searle says that the idea of a nonbiological machine being intelligent is incoherent he proposes the chinese room argument wwwformalstanfordedujmcchinesehtml the philosopher hubert dreyfus says that ai is impossible the computer scientist joseph weizenbaum says the idea is obscene antihuman and immoral various people have said that since artificial intelligence hasnt reached human level by now it must be impossible still other people are disappointed that companies they invested in went bankrupt q arent computability theory and computational complexity the keys to ai note to the layman and beginners in computer science these are quite technical branches of mathematical logic and computer science and the answer to the question has to be somewhat technical a no these theories are relevant but dont address the fundamental problems of ai in the 1930s mathematical logicians especially kurt gödel and alan turing established that there did not exist algorithms that were guaranteed to solve all problems in certain important mathematical domains whether a sentence of first order logic is a theorem is one example and whether a polynomial equations in several variables has integer solutions is another humans solve problems in these domains all the time and this has been offered as an argument usually with some decorations that computers are intrinsically incapable of doing what people do roger penrose claims this however people cant guarantee to solve arbitrary problems in these domains either see my review of the emperors new mind by roger penrose more essays and reviews defending ai research are in mcc96a in the 1960s computer scientists especially steve cook and richard karp developed the theory of npcomplete problem domains problems in these domains are solvable but seem to take time exponential in the size of the problem which sentences of propositional calculus are satisfiable is a basic example of an npcomplete problem domain humans often solve problems in npcomplete domains in times much shorter than is guaranteed by the general algorithms but cant solve them quickly in general what is important for ai is to have algorithms as capable as people at solving problems the identification of subdomains for which good algorithms exist is important but a lot of ai problem solvers are not associated with readily identified subdomains the theory of the difficulty of general classes of problems is called computational complexity so far this theory hasnt interacted with ai as much as might have been hoped success in problem solving by humans and by ai programs seems to rely on properties of problems and problem solving methods that the neither the complexity researchers nor the ai community have been able to identify precisely algorithmic complexity theory as developed by solomonoff kolmogorov and chaitin independently of one another is also relevant it defines the complexity of a symbolic object as the length of the shortest program that will generate it proving that a candidate program is the shortest or close to the shortest is an unsolvable problem but representing objects by short programs that generate them should sometimes be illuminating even when you cant prove that the program is the shortest next branches of ai up what is artificial intelligence previous what is artificial intelligence john mccarthy 20071112q is intelligence a single thing so that one can ask a yes or no question is this machine intelligent or not a no intelligence involves mechanisms and ai research has discovered how to make computers carry out some of them and not others if doing a task requires only mechanisms that are well understood today computer programs can give very impressive performances on these tasks such programs should be considered somewhat intelligent q isnt ai about simulating human intelligence a sometimes but not always or even usually on the one hand we can learn something about how to make machines solve problems by observing other people or just by observing our own methods on the other hand most work in ai involves studying the problems the world presents to intelligence rather than studying people or animals ai researchers are free to use methods that are not observed in people or that involve much more computing than people can do q what about iq do computer programs have iqs a no iq is based on the rates at which intelligence develops in children it is the ratio of the age at which a child normally makes a certain score to the childs age the scale is extended to adults in a suitable way iq correlates well with various measures of success or failure in life but making computers that can score high on iq tests would be weakly correlated with their usefulness for example the ability of a child to repeat back a long sequence of digits correlates well with other intellectual abilities perhaps because it measures how much information the child can compute with at once however digit span is trivial for even extremely limited computers however some of the problems on iq tests are useful challenges for ai q what about other comparisons between human and computer intelligence arthur r jensen jen98 a leading researcher in human intelligence suggests as a heuristic hypothesis that all normal humans have the same intellectual mechanisms and that differences in intelligence are related to quantitative biochemical and physiological conditions i see them as speed short term memory and the ability to form accurate and retrievable long term memories whether or not jensen is right about human intelligence the situation in ai today is the reverse computer programs have plenty of speed and memory but their abilities correspond to the intellectual mechanisms that program designers understand well enough to put in programs some abilities that children normally dont develop till they are teenagers may be in and some abilities possessed by two year olds are still out the matter is further complicated by the fact that the cognitive sciences still have not succeeded in determining exactly what the human abilities are very likely the organization of the intellectual mechanisms for ai can usefully be different from that in people whenever people do better than computers on some task or computers use a lot of computation to do as well as people this demonstrates that the program designers lack understanding of the intellectual mechanisms required to do the task efficiently q when did ai research start a after wwii a number of people independently started to work on intelligent machines the english mathematician alan turing may have been the first he gave a lecture on it in 1947 he also may have been the first to decide that ai was best researched by programming computers rather than by building machines by the late 1950s there were many researchers on ai and most of them were basing their work on programming computers q does ai aim to put the human mind into the computer a some researchers say they have that objective but maybe they are using the phrase metaphorically the human mind has a lot of peculiarities and im not sure anyone is serious about imitating all of them q what is the turing test a alan turings 1950 article computing machinery and intelligence tur50 discussed conditions for considering a machine to be intelligent he argued that if the machine could successfully pretend to be human to a knowledgeable observer then you certainly should consider it intelligent this test would satisfy most people but not all philosophers the observer could interact with the machine and a human by teletype to avoid requiring that the machine imitate the appearance or voice of the person and the human would try to persuade the observer that it was human and the machine would try to fool the observer the turing test is a onesided test a machine that passes the test should certainly be considered intelligent but a machine could still be considered intelligent without knowing enough about humans to imitate a human daniel dennetts book brainchildren den98 has an excellent discussion of the turing test and the various partial turing tests that have been implemented ie with restrictions on the observers knowledge of ai and the subject matter of questioning it turns out that some people are easily led into believing that a rather dumb program is intelligent q does ai aim at humanlevel intelligence a yes the ultimate effort is to make computer programs that can solve problems and achieve goals in the world as well

is important for ai is to have algorithms as capable as people at solving problems the identification of subdomains for which good algorithms exist is important but a lot of ai problem solvers are not associated with readily identified subdomains the theory of the difficulty of general classes of problems is called computational complexity so far this theory hasnt interacted with ai as much as might have been hoped success in problem solving by humans and by ai programs seems to rely on properties of problems and problem solving methods that the neither the complexity researchers nor the ai community have been able to identify precisely algorithmic complexity theory as developed by solomonoff kolmogorov and chaitin independently of one another is also relevant it defines the complexity of a symbolic object as the length of the shortest program that will generate it proving that a candidate program is the shortest or close to the shortest is an unsolvable problem but representing objects by short programs that generate them should sometimes be illuminating even when you cant prove that the program is the shortest next branches of ai up what is artificial intelligence previous what is artificial intelligence john mccarthy 20071112a sometimes but not always or even usually on the one hand we can learn something about how to make machines solve problems by observing other people or just by observing our own methods on the other hand most work in ai involves studying the problems the world presents to intelligence rather than studying people or animals ai researchers are free to use methods that are not observed in people or that involve much more computing than people can do q what about iq do computer programs have iqs a no iq is based on the rates at which intelligence develops in children it is the ratio of the age at which a child normally makes a certain score to the childs age the scale is extended to adults in a suitable way iq correlates well with various measures of success or failure in life but making computers that can score high on iq tests would be weakly correlated with their usefulness for example the ability of a child to repeat back a long sequence of digits correlates well with other intellectual abilities perhaps because it measures how much information the child can compute with at once however digit span is trivial for even extremely limited computers however some of the problems on iq tests are useful challenges for ai q what about other comparisons between human and computer intelligence arthur r jensen jen98 a leading researcher in human intelligence suggests as a heuristic hypothesis that all normal humans have the same intellectual mechanisms and that differences in intelligence are related to quantitative biochemical and physiological conditions i see them as speed short term memory and the ability to form accurate and retrievable long term memories whether or not jensen is right about human intelligence the situation in ai today is the reverse computer programs have plenty of speed and memory but their abilities correspond to the intellectual mechanisms that program designers understand well enough to put in programs some abilities that children normally dont develop till they are teenagers may be in and some abilities possessed by two year olds are still out the matter is further complicated by the fact that the cognitive sciences still have not succeeded in determining exactly what the human abilities are very likely the organization of the intellectual mechanisms for ai can usefully be different from that in people whenever people do better than computers on some task or computers use a lot of computation to do as well as people this demonstrates that the program designers lack understanding of the intellectual mechanisms required to do the task efficiently q when did ai research start a after wwii a number of people independently started to work on intelligent machines the english mathematician alan turing may have been the first he gave a lecture on it in 1947 he also may have been the first to decide that ai was best researched by programming computers rather than by building machines by the late 1950s there were many researchers on ai and most of them were basing their work on programming computers q does ai aim to put the human mind into the computer a some researchers say they have that objective but maybe they are using the phrase metaphorically the human mind has a lot of peculiarities and im not sure anyone is serious about imitating all of them q what is the turing test a alan turings 1950 article computing machinery and intelligence tur50 discussed conditions for considering a machine to be intelligent he argued that if the machine could successfully pretend to be human to a knowledgeable observer then you certainly should consider it intelligent this test would satisfy most people but not all philosophers the observer could interact with the machine and a human by teletype to avoid requiring that the machine imitate the appearance or voice of the person and the human would try to persuade the observer that it was human and the machine would try to fool the observer the turing test is a onesided test a machine that passes the test should certainly be considered intelligent but a machine could still be considered intelligent without knowing enough about humans to imitate a human daniel dennetts book brainchildren den98 has an excellent discussion of the turing test and the various partial turing tests that have been implemented ie with restrictions on the observers knowledge of ai and the subject matter of questioning it turns out that some people are easily led into believing that a rather dumb program is intelligent q does ai aim at humanlevel intelligence a yes the ultimate effort is to make computer programs that can solve problems and achieve goals in the world as well as humans however many people involved in particular research areas are much less ambitious q how far is ai from reaching humanlevel intelligence when will it happen a a few people think that humanlevel intelligence can be achieved by writing large numbers of programs of the kind people are now writing and assembling vast knowledge bases of facts in the languages now used for expressing knowledge however most ai researchers believe that new fundamental ideas are required and therefore it cannot be predicted when humanlevel intelligence will be achieved q are computers the right kind of machine to be made intelligent a computers can be programmed to simulate any kind of machine many researchers invented noncomputer machines hoping that they would be intelligent in different ways than the computer programs could be however they usually simulate their invented machines on a computer and come to doubt that the new machine is worth building because many billions of dollars that have been spent in making computers faster and faster another kind of machine would have to be very fast to perform better than a program on a computer simulating the machine q are computers fast enough to be intelligent a some people think much faster computers are required as well as new ideas my own opinion is that the computers of 30 years ago were fast enough if only we knew how to program them of course quite apart from the ambitions of ai researchers computers will keep getting faster q what about parallel machines a machines with many processors are much faster than single processors can be parallelism itself presents no advantages and parallel machines are somewhat awkward to program when extreme speed is required it is necessary to face this awkwardness q what about making a child machine that could improve by reading and by learning from experience a this idea has been proposed many times starting in the 1940s eventually it will be made to work however ai programs havent yet reached the level of being able to learn much of what a child learns from physical experience nor do present programs understand language well enough to learn much by reading q might an ai system be able to bootstrap itself to higher and higher level intelligence by thinking about ai a i think yes but we arent yet at a level of ai at which this process can begin q what about chess a alexander kronrod a russian ai researcher said chess is the drosophila of ai he was making an analogy with geneticists use of that fruit fly to study inheritance playing chess requires certain intellectual mechanisms and not others chess programs now play at grandmaster level but they do it with limited intellectual mechanisms compared to those used by a human chess player substituting large amounts of computation for understanding once we understand these mechanisms better we can build humanlevel chess programs that do far less computation than do present programs unfortunately the competitive and commercial aspects of making computers play chess have taken precedence over using chess as a scientific domain it is as if the geneticists after 1910 had organized fruit fly races and concentrated their efforts on breeding fruit flies that could win these races q what about go a the chinese and japanese game of go is also a board game in which the players take turns moving go exposes the weakness of our present understanding of the intellectual mechanisms involved in human game playing go programs are very bad players in spite of considerable effort not as much as for chess the problem seems to be that a position in go has to be divided mentally into a collection of subpositions which are first analyzed separately followed by an analysis of their interaction humans use this in chess also but chess programs consider the position as a whole chess programs compensate for the lack of this intellectual mechanism by doing thousands or in the case of deep blue many millions of times as much computation sooner or later ai research will overcome this scandalous weakness q dont some people say that ai is a bad idea a the philosopher john searle says that the idea of a nonbiological machine being intelligent is incoherent he proposes the chinese room argument wwwformalstanfordedujmcchinesehtml the philosopher hubert dreyfus says that ai is impossible the computer scientist joseph weizenbaum says the idea is obscene antihuman and immoral various people have said that since artificial intelligence hasnt reached human level by now it must be impossible still other people are disappointed that companies they invested in went bankrupt q arent computability theory and computational complexity the keys to ai note to the layman and beginners in computer science these are quite technical branches of mathematical logic and computer science and the answer to the question has to be somewhat technical a no these theories are relevant but dont address the fundamental problems of ai in the 1930s mathematical logicians especially kurt gödel and alan turing established that there did not exist algorithms that were guaranteed to solve all problems in

exposes the weakness of our present understanding of the intellectual mechanisms involved in human game playing go programs are very bad players in spite of considerable effort not as much as for

science these are quite technical branches of mathematical logic and computer science and the answer to the question has to be somewhat technical a no these theories are relevant but dont address the fundamental problems of ai in the 1930s mathematical logicians especially kurt gödel and alan turing established that there did not exist algorithms that were guaranteed to solve all problems in certain important mathematical domains whether a sentence of first order logic is a theorem is one example and whether a polynomial equations in several variables has integer solutions is another humans solve problems in these domains all the time and this has been offered as an argument usually with some decorations that computers are intrinsically incapable of doing what people do roger penrose claims this however people cant guarantee to solve arbitrary problems in these domains either see my review of the emperors new mind by roger penrose more essays and reviews defending ai research are in mcc96a in the 1960s computer scientists especially steve cook and richard karp developed the theory of npcomplete problem domains problems in these domains are solvable but seem to take time exponential in the size of the problem which sentences of propositional calculus are satisfiable is a basic example of an npcomplete problem domain humans often solve problems in npcomplete domains in times much shorter than is guaranteed by the general algorithms but cant solve them quickly in general what is important for ai is to have algorithms as capable as people at solving problems the identification of subdomains for which good algorithms exist is important but a lot of ai problem solvers are not associated with readily identified subdomains the theory of the difficulty of general classes of problems is called computational complexity so far this theory hasnt interacted with ai as much as might have been hoped success in problem solving by humans and by ai programs seems to rely on properties of problems and problem solving methods that the neither the complexity researchers nor the ai community have been able to identify precisely algorithmic complexity theory as developed by solomonoff kolmogorov and chaitin independently of one another is also relevant it defines the complexity of a symbolic object as the length of the shortest program that will generate it proving that a candidate program is the shortest or close to the shortest is an unsolvable problem but representing objects by short programs that generate them should sometimes be illuminating even when you cant prove that the program is the shortest next branches of ai up what is artificial intelligence previous what is artificial intelligence john mccarthy 20071112q what about other comparisons between human and computer intelligence arthur r jensen jen98 a leading researcher in human intelligence suggests as a heuristic hypothesis that all normal humans have the same intellectual mechanisms and that differences in intelligence are related to quantitative biochemical and physiological conditions i see them as speed short term memory and the ability to form accurate and retrievable long term memories whether or not jensen is right about human intelligence the situation in ai today is the reverse computer programs have plenty of speed and memory but their abilities correspond to the intellectual mechanisms that program designers understand well enough to put in programs some abilities that children normally dont develop till they are teenagers may be in and some abilities possessed by two year olds are still out the matter is further complicated by the fact that the cognitive sciences still have not succeeded in determining exactly what the human abilities are very likely the organization of the intellectual mechanisms for ai can usefully be different from that in people whenever people do better than computers on some task or computers use a lot of computation to do as well as people this demonstrates that the program designers lack understanding of the intellectual mechanisms required to do the task efficiently q when did ai research start a after wwii a number of people independently started to work on intelligent machines the english mathematician alan turing may have been the first he gave a lecture on it in 1947 he also may have been the first to decide that ai was best researched by programming computers rather than by building machines by the late 1950s there were many researchers on ai and most of them were basing their work on programming computers q does ai aim to put the human mind into the computer a some researchers say they have that objective but maybe they are using the phrase metaphorically the human mind has a lot of peculiarities and im not sure anyone is serious about imitating all of them q what is the turing test a alan turings 1950 article computing machinery and intelligence tur50 discussed conditions for considering a machine to be intelligent he argued that if the machine could successfully pretend to be human to a knowledgeable observer then you certainly should consider it intelligent this test would satisfy most people but not all philosophers the observer could interact with the machine and a human by teletype to avoid requiring that the machine imitate the appearance or voice of the person and the human would try to persuade the observer that it was human and the machine would try to fool the observer the turing test is a onesided test a machine that passes the test should certainly be considered intelligent but a machine could still be considered intelligent without knowing enough about humans to imitate a human daniel dennetts book brainchildren den98 has an excellent discussion of the turing test and the various partial turing tests that have been implemented ie with restrictions on the observers knowledge of ai and the subject matter of questioning it turns out that some people are easily led into believing that a rather dumb program is intelligent q does ai aim at humanlevel intelligence a yes the ultimate effort is to make computer programs that can solve problems and achieve goals in the world as well as humans however many people involved in particular research areas are much less ambitious q how far is ai from reaching humanlevel intelligence when will it happen a a few people think that humanlevel intelligence can be achieved by writing large numbers of programs of the kind people are now writing and assembling vast knowledge bases of facts in the languages now used for expressing knowledge however most ai researchers believe that new fundamental ideas are required and therefore it cannot be predicted when humanlevel intelligence will be achieved q are computers the right kind of machine to be made intelligent a computers can be programmed to simulate any kind of machine many researchers invented noncomputer machines hoping that they would be intelligent in different ways than the computer programs could be however they usually simulate their invented machines on a computer and come to doubt that the new machine is worth building because many billions of dollars that have been spent in making computers faster and faster another kind of machine would have to be very fast to perform better than a program on a computer simulating the machine q are computers fast enough to be intelligent a some people think much faster computers are required as well as new ideas my own opinion is that the computers of 30 years ago were fast enough if only we knew how to program them of course quite apart from the ambitions of ai researchers computers will keep getting faster q what about parallel machines a machines with many processors are much faster than single processors can be parallelism itself presents no advantages and parallel machines are somewhat awkward to program when extreme speed is required it is necessary to face this awkwardness q what about making a child machine that could improve by reading and by learning from experience a this idea has been proposed many times starting in the 1940s eventually it will be made to work however ai programs havent yet reached the level of being able to learn much of what a child learns from physical experience nor do present programs understand language well enough to learn much by reading q might an ai system be able to bootstrap itself to higher and higher level intelligence by thinking about ai a i think yes but we arent yet at a level of ai at which this process can begin q what about chess a alexander kronrod a russian ai researcher said chess is the drosophila of ai he was making an analogy with geneticists use of that fruit fly to study inheritance playing chess requires certain intellectual mechanisms and not others chess programs now play at grandmaster level but they do it with limited intellectual mechanisms compared to those used by a human chess player substituting large amounts of computation for understanding once we understand these mechanisms better we can build humanlevel chess programs

times as much computation sooner or later ai research will overcome this scandalous weakness q dont some people say that ai is a bad idea a the philosopher john searle says that the idea of a nonbiological machine being intelligent is incoherent he proposes the chinese room argument wwwformalstanfordedujmcchinesehtml the philosopher hubert dreyfus says that ai is impossible the computer scientist joseph weizenbaum says the idea is obscene antihuman and immoral various people have said that since artificial intelligence hasnt reached human level by now it must be impossible still other people are disappointed that companies they invested in went bankrupt q arent computability theory and computational complexity the keys to ai note to the layman and beginners in computer science these are quite technical branches of mathematical logic and computer science and the answer to the question has to be somewhat technical a no these theories are relevant but dont address the fundamental problems of ai in the 1930s mathematical logicians especially kurt gödel and alan turing established that there did not exist algorithms that were guaranteed to solve all problems in certain important mathematical domains whether a sentence of first order logic is a theorem is one example and whether a polynomial equations in several variables has integer solutions is another humans solve problems in these domains all the time and this has been offered as an argument usually with some decorations that computers are intrinsically incapable of doing what people do roger penrose claims this however people cant guarantee to solve arbitrary problems in these domains either see my review of the emperors new mind by roger penrose more essays and reviews defending ai research are in mcc96a in the 1960s computer scientists especially steve cook and richard karp developed the theory of npcomplete problem domains problems in these domains are solvable but seem to take time exponential in the size of the problem which sentences of propositional calculus are satisfiable is a basic example of an npcomplete problem domain humans often solve problems in npcomplete domains in times much shorter than is guaranteed by the general algorithms but cant solve them quickly in general what is important for ai is to have algorithms as capable as people at solving problems the identification of subdomains for which good algorithms exist is important but a lot of ai problem solvers are not associated with readily identified subdomains the theory of the difficulty of general classes of problems is called computational complexity so far this theory hasnt interacted with ai as much as might have been hoped success in problem solving by humans and by ai programs seems to rely on properties of problems and problem solving methods that the neither the complexity researchers nor the ai community have been able to identify precisely algorithmic complexity theory as developed by solomonoff kolmogorov and chaitin independently of one another is also relevant it defines the complexity of a symbolic object as the length of the shortest program that will generate it proving that a candidate program is the shortest or close to the shortest is an unsolvable problem but representing objects by short programs that generate them should sometimes be illuminating even when you cant prove that the program is the shortest next branches of ai up what is artificial intelligence previous what is artificial intelligence john mccarthy 20071112whenever people do better than computers on some task or computers use a lot of computation to do as well as people this demonstrates that the program designers lack understanding of the intellectual mechanisms required to do the task efficiently q when did ai research start a after wwii a number of people independently started to work on intelligent machines the english mathematician alan turing may have been the first he gave a lecture on it in 1947 he also may have been the first to decide that ai was best researched by programming computers rather than by building machines by the late 1950s there were many researchers on ai and most of them were basing their work on programming computers q does ai aim to put the human mind into the computer a some researchers say they have that objective but maybe they are using the phrase metaphorically the human mind has a lot of peculiarities and im not sure anyone is serious about imitating all of them q what is the turing test a alan turings 1950 article computing machinery and intelligence tur50 discussed conditions for considering a machine to be intelligent he argued that if the machine could successfully pretend to be human to a knowledgeable observer then you certainly should consider it intelligent this test would satisfy most people but not all philosophers the observer could interact with the machine and a human by teletype to avoid requiring that the machine imitate the appearance or voice of the person and the human would try to persuade the observer that it was human and the machine would try to fool the observer the turing test is a onesided test a machine that passes the test should certainly be considered intelligent but a machine could still be considered intelligent without knowing enough about humans to imitate a human daniel dennetts book brainchildren den98 has an excellent discussion of the turing test and the various partial turing tests that have been implemented ie with restrictions on the observers knowledge of ai and the subject matter of questioning it turns out that some people are easily led into believing that a rather dumb program is intelligent q does ai aim at humanlevel intelligence a yes the ultimate effort is to make computer programs that can solve problems and achieve goals in the world as well as humans however many people involved in particular research areas are much less ambitious q how far is ai from reaching humanlevel intelligence when will it happen a a few people think that humanlevel intelligence can be achieved by writing large numbers of programs of the kind people are now writing and assembling vast knowledge bases of facts in the languages now used for expressing knowledge however most ai researchers believe that new fundamental ideas are required and therefore it cannot be predicted when humanlevel intelligence will be achieved q are computers the right kind of machine to be made intelligent a computers can be programmed to simulate any kind of machine many researchers invented noncomputer machines hoping that they would be intelligent in different ways than the computer programs could be however they usually simulate their invented machines on a computer and come to doubt that the new machine is worth building because many billions of dollars that have been spent in making computers faster and faster another kind of machine would have to be very fast to perform better than a program on a computer simulating the machine q are computers fast enough to be intelligent a some people think much faster computers are required as well as new ideas my own opinion is that the computers of 30 years ago were fast enough if only we knew how to program them of course quite apart from the ambitions of ai researchers computers will keep getting faster q what about parallel machines a machines with many processors are much faster than single processors can be parallelism itself presents no advantages and parallel machines are somewhat awkward to program when extreme speed is required it is necessary to face this awkwardness q what about making a child machine that could improve by reading and by learning from experience a this idea has been proposed many times starting in the 1940s eventually it will be made to work however ai programs havent yet reached the level of being able to learn much of what a child learns from physical experience nor do present programs understand language well enough to learn much by reading q might an ai system be able to bootstrap itself to higher and higher level intelligence by thinking about ai a i think yes but we arent yet at a level of ai at which this process can begin q what about chess a alexander kronrod a russian ai researcher said chess is the drosophila of ai he was making an analogy with geneticists use of that fruit fly to study inheritance playing chess requires certain intellectual mechanisms and not others chess programs now play at grandmaster level but they do it with limited intellectual mechanisms compared to those used by a human chess player substituting large amounts of computation for understanding once we understand these mechanisms better we can build humanlevel chess programs that do far less computation than do present programs unfortunately the competitive and commercial aspects of making computers play chess have taken precedence over using chess as a scientific domain it is as if the geneticists after 1910 had organized fruit fly races and concentrated their efforts on breeding fruit flies that could win these races q what about go a the chinese and japanese game of go is also a board game in which the players take turns moving go exposes the weakness of our present understanding of the intellectual mechanisms involved in human game playing go programs are very bad players in spite of considerable effort not as much as for chess the problem seems to be that a position in go has to be divided mentally into a collection of subpositions which are first analyzed separately followed by an analysis of their interaction humans use this in chess also but chess programs consider the position as a

involved in particular research areas are much less ambitious q how far is ai from reaching humanlevel intelligence when will it happen a a few people think that humanlevel intelligence can be achieved by writing large numbers of programs of the kind people are now writing and assembling vast knowledge bases of facts in the languages now used for expressing knowledge however most ai researchers believe that new fundamental ideas are required and therefore it cannot be predicted when humanlevel intelligence will be achieved q are computers the right kind of machine to be made intelligent a computers can be programmed to simulate any kind of machine many researchers invented noncomputer machines hoping that they would be intelligent in different ways than the computer programs could be however they usually simulate their invented machines on a computer and come to doubt that the new machine is worth building because many billions of dollars that have been spent in making computers faster and faster another kind of machine would have to be very fast to perform better than a program on a computer simulating the machine q are computers fast enough to be intelligent a some people think much faster computers are required as well as new ideas my own opinion is that the computers of 30 years ago were fast enough if only we knew how to program them of course quite apart from the ambitions of ai researchers computers will keep getting faster q what about parallel machines a machines with many processors are much faster than single processors can be parallelism itself presents no advantages and parallel machines are somewhat awkward to program when extreme speed is required it is necessary to face this awkwardness q what about making a child machine that could improve by reading and by learning from experience a this idea has been proposed many times starting in the 1940s eventually it will be made to work however ai programs havent yet reached the level of being able to learn much of what a child learns from physical experience nor do present programs understand language well enough to learn much by reading q might an ai system be able to bootstrap itself to higher and higher level intelligence by thinking about ai a i think yes but we arent yet at a level of ai at which this process can begin q what about chess a alexander kronrod a russian ai researcher said chess is the drosophila of ai he was making an analogy with geneticists use of that fruit fly to study inheritance playing chess requires certain intellectual mechanisms and not others chess programs now play at grandmaster level but they do it with limited intellectual mechanisms compared to those used by a human chess player substituting large amounts of computation for understanding once we understand these mechanisms better we can build humanlevel chess programs that do far less computation than do present programs unfortunately the competitive and commercial aspects of making computers play chess have taken precedence over using chess as a scientific domain it is as if the geneticists after 1910 had organized fruit fly races and concentrated their efforts on breeding fruit flies that could win these races q what about go a the chinese and japanese game of go is also a board game in which the players take turns moving go exposes the weakness of our present understanding of the intellectual mechanisms involved in human game playing go programs are very bad players in spite of considerable effort not as much as for chess the problem seems to be that a position in go has to be divided mentally into a collection of subpositions which are first analyzed separately followed by an analysis of their interaction humans use this in chess also but chess programs consider the position as a whole chess programs compensate for the lack of this intellectual mechanism by doing thousands or in the case of deep blue many millions of times as much computation sooner or later ai research will overcome this scandalous weakness q dont some people say that ai is a bad idea a the philosopher john searle says that the idea of a nonbiological machine being intelligent is incoherent he proposes the chinese room argument wwwformalstanfordedujmcchinesehtml the philosopher hubert dreyfus says that ai is impossible the computer scientist joseph weizenbaum says the idea is obscene antihuman and immoral various people have said that since artificial intelligence hasnt reached human level by now it must be impossible still other people are disappointed that companies they invested in went bankrupt q arent computability theory and computational complexity the keys to ai note to the layman and beginners in computer science these are quite technical branches of mathematical logic and computer science and the answer to the question has to be somewhat technical a no these theories are relevant but dont address the fundamental problems of ai in the 1930s mathematical logicians especially kurt gödel and alan turing established that there did not exist algorithms that were guaranteed to solve all problems in certain important mathematical domains whether a sentence of first order logic is a theorem is one example and whether a polynomial equations in several variables has integer solutions is another humans solve problems in these domains all the time and this has been offered as an argument usually with some decorations that computers are intrinsically incapable of doing what people do roger penrose claims this however people cant guarantee to solve arbitrary problems in these domains either see my review of the emperors new mind by roger penrose more essays and reviews defending ai research are in mcc96a in the 1960s computer scientists especially steve cook and richard karp developed the theory of npcomplete problem domains problems in these domains are solvable but seem to take time exponential in the size of the problem which sentences of propositional calculus are satisfiable is a basic example of an npcomplete problem domain humans often solve problems in npcomplete domains in times much shorter than is guaranteed by the general algorithms but cant solve them quickly in general what is important for ai is to have algorithms as capable as people at solving problems the identification of subdomains for which good algorithms exist is important but a lot of ai problem solvers are not associated with readily identified subdomains the theory of the difficulty of general classes of problems is called computational complexity so far this theory hasnt interacted with ai as much as might have been hoped success in problem solving by humans and by ai programs seems to rely on properties of problems and problem solving methods that the neither the complexity researchers nor the ai community have been able to identify precisely algorithmic complexity theory as developed by solomonoff kolmogorov and chaitin independently of one another is also relevant it defines the complexity of a symbolic object as the length of the shortest program

be illuminating even when you cant prove that the program is the shortest next branches of ai up what is artificial intelligence previous what is artificial intelligence john mccarthy 20071112q what is the turing test a alan turings 1950 article computing machinery and intelligence tur50 discussed conditions for considering a machine to be intelligent he argued that if the machine could successfully pretend to be human to a knowledgeable observer then you certainly should consider it intelligent this test would satisfy most people but not all philosophers the observer could interact with the machine and a human by teletype to avoid requiring that the machine imitate the appearance or voice of the person and the human would try to persuade the observer that it was human and the machine would try to fool the observer the turing test is a onesided test a machine that passes the test should certainly be considered intelligent but a machine could still be considered intelligent without knowing enough about humans to imitate a human daniel dennetts book brainchildren den98 has an excellent discussion of the turing test and the various partial turing tests that have been

made to work however ai programs havent yet reached the level of being able to learn much of what a child learns from physical experience nor do present programs understand language well enough to learn much by reading q might an ai system be able to bootstrap itself to higher and higher level intelligence by thinking about ai a i think yes but we arent yet at a level of ai at which this

playing chess requires certain intellectual mechanisms and not others chess programs now play at grandmaster level but they do it with limited intellectual mechanisms compared to those used by a human chess player substituting large amounts of computation for understanding once we understand these mechanisms better we can build humanlevel chess programs that do far less computation than do present programs unfortunately the competitive and commercial aspects of making computers play chess have taken precedence over using chess as a scientific domain it is as if the geneticists after 1910 had organized fruit fly races and concentrated their efforts on breeding fruit flies that could win these races q what about go a the chinese and japanese game of go is also a board game in which the players take turns moving go exposes the weakness of our present understanding of the intellectual mechanisms involved in human game playing go programs are very bad players in spite of considerable effort not as much as for chess the problem seems to be that a position in go has to be divided mentally into a collection of subpositions which are first analyzed separately followed by an analysis of their interaction humans use this in chess also but chess programs consider the position as a whole chess programs compensate for the lack of this intellectual mechanism by doing thousands or in the case of deep blue many millions of times as much computation sooner or later ai research will overcome this scandalous weakness q dont some people say that ai is a bad idea a the philosopher john searle says that the idea of a nonbiological machine being intelligent is incoherent he proposes the chinese room argument wwwformalstanfordedujmcchinesehtml the philosopher hubert dreyfus says that ai is impossible the computer scientist joseph weizenbaum says the idea is obscene antihuman and immoral various people have said that since artificial intelligence hasnt reached human level by now it

beginners in computer science these are quite technical branches of mathematical logic and computer science and the answer to the question has to be somewhat technical a no these theories are relevant but dont address the fundamental problems of ai in the 1930s mathematical logicians especially kurt gödel and alan turing established that there did not exist algorithms that were guaranteed to solve all problems in certain important mathematical domains whether a sentence of first order logic is a theorem is one example and whether a polynomial equations in several variables has integer solutions

the ultimate effort is to make computer programs that can solve problems and achieve goals in the world as well as humans however many people involved in particular research areas are much less

people are now writing and assembling vast knowledge bases of facts in the languages now used for expressing knowledge however most ai researchers believe that new fundamental ideas are required and therefore it cannot be predicted when humanlevel intelligence will be achieved q are computers the right kind of machine to be made intelligent a computers can be programmed to simulate any kind of machine many researchers invented noncomputer machines hoping that they would be intelligent in different ways than the computer programs could be however they usually simulate their invented machines

higher and higher level intelligence by thinking about ai a i think yes but we arent yet at a level of ai at which this process can begin q what about chess a alexander kronrod a russian ai researcher said chess is the drosophila of ai he was making an analogy with geneticists use of that fruit fly to study inheritance playing chess requires certain intellectual mechanisms and not others chess programs now play at grandmaster level but they do it with limited intellectual mechanisms compared to those used by a human chess player substituting large amounts of computation for understanding once we understand these mechanisms better we can build humanlevel chess programs that do far less computation than do present programs unfortunately the competitive and commercial aspects of making computers play chess have taken precedence over using chess as a scientific domain it is as if the geneticists after 1910 had organized fruit fly races and concentrated their efforts on breeding fruit flies that could win these races q what about go a the chinese and japanese game of go is also a board game in which the players take turns moving go exposes the weakness of our present understanding of the intellectual mechanisms involved in human game playing go programs are very bad players in spite of considerable effort not as much as for chess the problem seems to be that a position in go has to be divided mentally into a collection of subpositions which are first analyzed separately followed by an analysis of their interaction humans use this in chess also but chess programs consider the position as a whole chess programs compensate for the lack of this intellectual mechanism by doing thousands or in the case of deep blue many millions of times as much computation sooner or later ai research will overcome this scandalous weakness q dont some people say that ai is a bad idea a the philosopher john searle says that the idea of a nonbiological machine being intelligent is incoherent he proposes the chinese room argument wwwformalstanfordedujmcchinesehtml the philosopher hubert dreyfus says that ai is impossible the computer scientist joseph weizenbaum says the idea is obscene antihuman and immoral various people have said that since artificial intelligence hasnt reached human level by now it must be impossible still other people are disappointed that companies they invested in went bankrupt q arent computability theory and computational complexity the keys to ai note to the layman and beginners in computer science these are quite technical branches of mathematical logic and computer science and the answer to the question has to be somewhat technical a no these theories are relevant but dont address the fundamental problems of ai in the 1930s mathematical logicians especially kurt gödel and alan turing established that there did not exist algorithms that were guaranteed to solve all problems in certain important mathematical domains whether a sentence of first order logic is a theorem is one example and whether a polynomial equations in several variables has integer solutions is another humans solve problems in these domains all the time and this has been offered as an argument usually with some decorations that computers are intrinsically incapable of doing what people do roger penrose claims this however people cant guarantee to solve arbitrary problems in these domains either see my review of the emperors new mind by roger penrose more essays and reviews defending ai research are in mcc96a in the 1960s computer scientists especially steve cook and richard karp developed the theory of npcomplete problem domains problems in these domains are solvable but seem to take time exponential in the size of the problem which sentences of propositional calculus are satisfiable is a basic example of an npcomplete problem domain humans often solve problems in npcomplete domains in times much shorter than is guaranteed by the general algorithms but cant solve them quickly in general what is important for ai is to have algorithms as capable as people at solving problems the identification of subdomains for which good algorithms exist is important but a lot of ai problem solvers are not associated with readily identified subdomains the theory of the difficulty of general classes of problems is called computational complexity so far this theory hasnt interacted with ai as much as might have been hoped success in problem solving by humans and by ai programs seems to rely on properties of problems and problem solving methods that the neither the complexity researchers nor the ai community have been able to identify precisely algorithmic complexity theory as developed by solomonoff kolmogorov and chaitin independently of one another is also relevant it defines the complexity of a symbolic object as the length of the shortest program that will generate it proving that a candidate program is the shortest or close to the shortest is an unsolvable problem but representing objects by short programs that generate them should sometimes be illuminating even when you cant prove that the program is the shortest next branches of ai up what is artificial intelligence previous what is artificial intelligence john mccarthy 20071112many researchers invented noncomputer machines hoping that they would be intelligent in different ways than the computer programs could be however they usually simulate their invented machines on a computer and come to doubt that the new machine is worth building because many billions of dollars that have been spent in making computers faster and faster another kind of machine would have to be very fast to perform better than a program on a computer simulating the machine q are computers fast enough to be intelligent a some people think much faster computers are required as well as new ideas my own opinion is that the computers of 30 years ago were fast enough if only we knew how to program them of course quite apart from the ambitions of ai researchers computers will keep getting faster q what about parallel machines a machines with many processors are much faster than single processors can be parallelism itself presents no advantages and parallel machines are somewhat awkward to program when extreme speed is required it is necessary to face this awkwardness q what about making a child machine that could improve by reading and by learning from experience a this idea has been proposed many times starting in the 1940s eventually it will be

artificial boy monica david\x92s mother henry david\x92s father martin david\x92s brother gigolo joe professor hobby william hurt head of cybertronics other films by director steven spielberg close encounters of the third kind 1977 et 1982 jurassic park 1993 synopsis the story behind ai was originally conceived by stanley kubrick who confided in steven spielberg on the project on kubrick\x92s sudden death in 1999 his widow persuaded spielberg to take over the film the film is set at a future time when progress in robotics poses a possible threat to the human species david a robotic boy is the artificial life form that is capable of experiencing love as a prototype he is given to a couple whose real son is in what appears to be an irreversible coma after a rough start david and his mother bond the real son miraculously awakes from the coma returns to the family and tricks david into doing dangerous things the father feels that they must return david to the manufacturer for destruction but the mother allows david to escape for the rest of the film david seeks to be reunited with his mother and for a time is joined on his quest by \x93gigolo joe\x94 a robot designed to be a male prostitute david becomes frozen in the ocean and millennia later \x96 long after the extinction of the human species \x96 robots of the future rescue him and allow him to reunite with his mother for one day that will last in his mind for eternity discussion questions 1 the film opens with the narrator stating that because of depleting natural resources human reproduction had been placed under strict control and only licensed couples could have children how bad would things need to get before licensing parents would become a necessity 2 at the beginning of the movie professor hobby states that \x93to create an artificial being has been the dream of man since the birth of science\x94 there\x92s probably an element of truth to this why do we have this fascination 3 one of the scientists at cybertronics asks \x93if a robot could genuinely love a person what responsibility does that person hold toward that mecha in return\x94 professor hobby responds \x93in the beginning didn\x92t god create adam to love him\x94 what is implied by professor hobby\x92s answer 4 when davids mother drops him off in the woods david cries out im sorry for not being real aside from the fact that hes been kicked out of his house why is he sorry for this 5 in a documentary on the movie steven spielberg states that the story is set at a time when humans and robots are on the brink of civil war this is graphically depicted in the \x93flesh fair\x94 where old or unregistered mechas are rounded up and destroyed gladiatorstyle before a cheering crowd one of the mechas explained that the flesh fair was an attempt to cut back on the numbers of mechas so that humans could maintain numerical superiority from the opposite perspective one of the humans at the fair said that mechas should be destroyed since they will take over why cant we just live in peace with robots 6 consider some of the imagery the flesh fair motorcycles cowboy hats heavy metal music flannel shirts what statement does this make about the kind of humans that opposed robots 7 an announcer at the flesh fair states the following what about us we are alive and this is a celebration of life and this is commitment to a truly human future how might the brutal destruction of robots a celebration of life 8 the owner of the flesh fair states that child mechas like david were built to disarm humans by playing on human emotions nevertheless the human spectators feel sympathy with david particularly because he pleads for his life what abilities would a robot have to exhibit before we would consider it an equal with humans 9 gigolo joe states that sex robots like him are the guiltless pleasures of the lonely human being would it really be guiltless to have sex with a robot that looked just like a real human what if the robot had the appearance of a tenyearold human 10 gigolo joe tells david that his mother does not love him but only loves what he does for her is it plausible to think that a normal human could love a robot as though it were a real human 11 gigolo joe tells david they made us too smart to quick and too many we are suffering for the mistakes they made because when the end comes all that will be left is us thats why they hate us is this a good reason to hate robots 12 david was the first of a kind in mecha design with an ability to experience love on the box containing the massproduced davids it states \x93at last a love of your own\x94 it turns out though that david has desires selfmotivated reason and the ability to chase down his dreams what is the connection between love and these other cognitive abilities 13 when david meets another david robot he destroys it in a fit of rage believing that this new david will compete with him for his mothers love in retrospect this outburst justifies the decision of davids parents to return him to cybertronics for destruction is this a critical element of the plot or just bad and inconsistent storytelling 14 david enters a warehouse containing boxes upon boxes of other davids he walks up to a facial mask of one of the davids and peers through its eye openings what if anything does this symbolize 15 as joe gets magnetically pulled up to a police helicopter his final words to david are i am i was the i am clause is a reference to descartes famous statement i think therefore i am which indicates joes assertion of his existence what does the i was clause signify 16 the ancient greek term deus ex machina refers to an awkward plot device introduced to get the hero out of a tough situation \x96 like the cavalry coming over the mountain at the last minute does the ending of this film rely on a deus ex machina 17 why does the narrator robot at the beginning and end of the movie have a british accent 18 in a documentary on the movie steven spielberg states that a key issue raised by the movie is the extent to which we have a moral responsibility to the intelligent robots that we will someday create what kind of qualities would a robot need before we would recognize our moral responsibility towards it reviews with every minute of every day we have computer builders and analysts that are trying to build the biggest computer on a smaller and smaller scale where it will end no one knows we have the aid to build any robotic thing and to add human looking skin over the frames to make them look human we are able to take dna and grow a human ear on a hairless rats back our technology is on the verge of getting us in serious trouble the story resembles the story of pinocchio where he wants to become a real boy only the time frame has changed i am fascinated with these movies that give us a glimpse of what may be some day in the future just like \x93i robot\x94 as a nation the human race has become lazy and needs help just to survive daily routines everything in life starts out simple then the so called mad scientist comes along and exceeds all expectations of what should or can be done in any given situation the realization is not that we can but should we become so advanced that we put our own selves out of the big picture do we eliminate all chances of new births just because it would be more convenient to build a child or have a child in an pod like in the matrix without thinking about anything other than how much money can be made or the better convenience we possibly will demote ourselves to the lower species instead of the rulers of the earth i loved the movie because it gave hope to such a hopeless scenario to look for the blue fairy to make all his dreams come true was the ultimate desire for love this was such a small thing to ask for but as he did not realize love is to be experienced by only humans that look for hope at the end of the tunnel hippy'}

from a 2014 postfor decades science fiction authors futurists and movie makers alike have been predicting the amazing and sometimes catastrophic changes that will arise with the advent of widespread artificial intelligence so far ai hasn’t made any such crazy waves and in many ways has quietly become ubiquitous in numerous aspects of our daily lives from the intelligent sensors that help us take perfect pictures to the automatic parking features in cars to the sometimes frustrating personal assistants in smartphones artificial intelligence of one kind of another is all around us all the timewhile we’ve yet to create selfaware robots like those that pepper popular movies like 2001 a space odyssey and star wars we have made smart and often significant use of ai technology in a wide range of applications that while not as mindblowing as androids still change our daytoday lives one place where artificial intelligence is poised to make big changes and in some cases already is is in educationwhile we may not see humanoid robots acting as teachers within the next decade there are many projects already in the works that use computer intelligence to help students and teachers get more out of the educational experience here are just a few of the ways those tools and those that will follow them will shape and define the educational experience of the future1 artificial intelligence can automate basic activities in education like grading in college grading homework and tests for large lecture courses can be tedious work even when tas split it between them even in lower grades teachers often find that grading takes up a significant amount of time time that could be used to interact with students prepare for class or work on professional developmentwhile ai may not ever be able to truly replace human grading it’s getting pretty close it’s now possible for teachers to automate grading for nearly all kinds of multiple choice and fillintheblank testing and automated grading of student writing may not be far behind today essaygrading software is still in its infancy and not quite up to par yet it can and will improve over the coming years allowing teachers to focus more on inclass activities and student interaction than grading2 educational software can be adapted to student needsfrom kindergarten to graduate school one of the key ways artificial intelligence will impact education is through the application of greater levels of individualized learning some of this is already happening through growing numbers of adaptive learning programs games and software these systems respond to the needs of the student putting greater emphasis on certain topics repeating things that students haven’t mastered and generally helping students to work at their own pace whatever that may bethis kind of customtailored education could be a machineassisted solution to helping students at different levels work together in one classroom with teachers facilitating the learning and offering help and support when needed adaptive learning has already had a huge impact on education across the nation especially through programs like khan academy and as ai advances in the coming decades adaptive programs like these will likely only improve and expand3 it can point out places where courses need to improveteachers may not always be aware of gaps in their lectures and educational materials that can leave students confused about certain concepts artificial intelligence offers a way to solve that problem coursera a massive open online course provider is already putting this into practice when a large number of students are found to submit the wrong answer to a homework assignment the system alerts the teacher and gives future students a customized message that offers hints to the correct answerthis type of system helps to fill in the gaps in explanation that can occur in courses and helps to ensure that all students are building the same conceptual foundation rather than waiting to hear back from the professor students get immediate feedback that helps them to understand a concept and remember how to do it correctly the next time around4 students could get additional support from ai tutorswhile there are obviously things that human tutors can offer that machines can’t at least not yet the future could see more students being tutored by tutors that only exist in zeros and ones some tutoring programs based on artificial intelligence already exist and can help students through basic mathematics writing and other subjectsthese programs can teach students fundamentals but so far aren’t ideal for helping students learn highorder thinking and creativity something that realworld teachers are still required to facilitate yet that shouldn’t rule out the possibility of ai tutors being able to do these things in the future with the rapid pace of technological advancement that has marked the past few decades advanced tutoring systems may not be a pipe dream5 aidriven programs can give students and educators helpful feedbackai can not only help teachers and students to craft courses that are customized to their needs but it can also provide feedback to both about the success of the course as a whole some schools especially those with online offerings are using ai systems to monitor student progress and to alert professors when there might be an issue with student performancethese kinds of ai systems allow students to get the support they need and for professors to find areas where they can improve instruction for students who may struggle with the subject matter ai programs at these schools aren’t just offering advice on individual courses however some are working to develop systems that can help students to choose majors based on areas where they succeed and struggle while students don’t have to take the advice it could mark a brave new world of college major selection for future students6 it is altering how we find and interact with informationwe rarely even notice the ai systems that affect the information we see and find on a daily basis google adapts results to users based on location amazon makes recommendations based on previous purchases siri adapts to your needs and commands and nearly all web ads are geared toward your interests and shopping preferencesthese kinds of intelligent systems play a big role in how we interact with information in our personal and professional lives and could just change how we find and use information in schools and academia as well over the past few decades aibased systems have already radically changed how we interact with information and with newer more integrated technology students in the future may have vastly different experiences doing research and looking up facts than the students of today7 it could change the role of teachersthere will always be a role for teachers in education but what that role is and what it entails may change due to new technology in the form of intelligent computing systems as we’ve already discussed ai can take over tasks like grading can help students improve learning and may even be a substitute for realworld tutoring yet ai could be adapted to many other aspects of teaching as well ai systems could be programmed to provide expertise serving as a place for students to ask questions and find information or could even potentially take the place of teachers for very basic course materials in most cases however ai will shift the role of the teacher to that of facilitatorteachers will supplement ai lessons assist students who are struggling and provide human interaction and handson experiences for students in many ways technology is already driving some of these changes in the classroom especially in schools that are online or embrace the flipped classroom model8 ai can make trialanderror learning less intimidatingtrial and error is a critical part of learning but for many students the idea of failing or even not knowing the answer is paralyzing some simply don’t like being put on the spot in front of their peers or authority figures like a teacher an intelligent computer system designed to help students to learn is a much less daunting way to deal with trial and error artificial intelligence could offer students a way to experiment and learn in a relatively judgmentfree environment especially when ai tutors can offer solutions for improvement in fact ai is the perfect format for supporting this kind of learning as ai systems themselves often learn by a trialanderror method9 data powered by ai can change how schools find teach and support studentssmart data gathering powered by intelligent computer systems is already making changes to how colleges interact with prospective and current students from recruiting to helping students choose the best courses intelligent computer systems are helping make every part of the college experience more closely tailored to student needs and goalsdata mining systems are already playing an integral role in today’s highered landscape but artificial intelligence could further alter higher education initiatives are already underway at some schools to offer students aiguided training that can ease the transition between college and high school who knows but that the college selection process may end up a lot like amazon or netflix with a system that recommends the best schools and programs for student interests10 ai may change where students learn who teaches them and how they acquire basic skillswhile major changes may still be a few decades in the future the reality is that artificial intelligence has the potential to radically change just about everything we take for granted about educationusing ai systems software and support students can learn from anywhere in the world at any time and with these kinds of programs taking the place of certain types of classroom instruction ai may just replace teachers in some instances for better or worse educational programs powered by ai are already helping students to learn basic skills but as these programs grow and as developers learn more they will likely offer students a much wider range of servicesthe result education could look a whole lot different a few decades from nowthis is a crosspost from onlineuniversitiescom 10 roles

sections of this piece are absent from the podcast because i recorded it a while backcontentsthis piece contains some observations on what looks to be potentially a coming machine revolution in earths history for general background reading a good place to start is wikipedias article on the technological singularityi am not an expert on all the arguments in this field and my views remain very open to change with new information in the face of epistemic disagreements with other very smart observers it makes sense to grant some credence to a variety of viewpoints each person brings unique contributions to the discussion by virtue of his or her particular background experience and intuitionsto date i have not found a detailed analysis of how those who are moved more by preventing suffering than by other values should approach singularity issues this seems to me a serious gap and research on this topic deserves high priority in general its important to expand discussion of singularity issues to encompass a broader range of participants than the engineers technophiles and sciencefiction nerds who have historically pioneered the fieldi j good observed in 1982 the urgent drives out the important so there is not very much written about ethical machines fortunately this may be changingin fall 2005 a friend pointed me to ray kurzweils the age of spiritual machines this was my first introduction to singularity ideas and i found the book pretty astonishing at the same time much of it seemed rather implausible to me in line with the attitudes of my peers i assumed that kurzweil was crazy and that while his ideas deserved further inspection they should not be taken at face valuein 2006 i discovered nick bostrom and eliezer yudkowsky and i began to follow the organization then called the singularity institute for artificial intelligence siai which is now miri i took siais ideas more seriously than kurzweils but i remained embarrassed to mention the organization because the first word in siais name sets off insanity alarms in listenersi began to study machine learning in order to get a better grasp of the ai field and in fall 2007 i switched my college major to computer science as i read textbooks and papers about machine learning i felt as though narrow ai was very different from the strongai fantasies that people painted ai programs are just a bunch of hacks i thought this isnt intelligence its just people using computers to manipulate data and perform optimization and they dress it up as ai to make it sound sexy machine learning in particular seemed to be just a computer scientists version of statistics neural networks were just an elaborated form of logistic regression there were stylistic differences such as computer sciences focus on crossvalidation and bootstrapping instead of testing parametric models made possible because computers can run dataintensive operations that were inaccessible to statisticians in the 1800s but overall this work didnt seem like the kind of real intelligence that people talked about for general aithis attitude began to change as i learned more cognitive science before 2008 my ideas about human cognition were vague like most scienceliterate people i believed the brain was a product of physical processes including firing patterns of neurons but i lacked further insight into what the black box of brains might contain this led me to be confused about what free will meant until mid2008 and about what consciousness meant until late 2009 cognitive science showed me that the brain was in fact very much like a computer at least in the sense of being a deterministic informationprocessing device with distinct algorithms and modules when viewed up close these algorithms could look as dumb as the kinds of algorithms in narrow ai that i had previously dismissed as not really intelligence of course animal brains combine these seemingly dumb subcomponents in dazzlingly complex and robust ways but i could now see that the difference between narrow ai and brains was a matter of degree rather than kind it now seemed plausible that broad ai could emerge from lots of work on narrow ai combined with stitching the parts together in the right waysso the singularity idea of artificial general intelligence seemed less crazy than it had initially this was one of the rare cases where a bold claim turned out to look more probable on further examination usually extraordinary claims lack much evidence and crumble on closer inspection i now think its quite likely maybe 75 that humans will produce at least a humanlevel ai within the next 300 years conditional on no major disasters such as sustained world economic collapse global nuclear war largescale nanotech war etc and also ignoring anthropic considerationsthe singularity concept is broader than the prediction of strong ai and can refer to several distinct submeanings like with most ideas theres a lot of fantasy and exaggeration associated with the singularity but at least the core idea that technology will progress at an accelerating rate for some time to come absent major setbacks is not particularly controversial exponential growth is the standard model in economics and while this cant continue forever it has been a robust pattern throughout human and even prehuman historymiri emphasizes ai for a good reason at the end of the day the longterm future of our galaxy will be dictated by ai not by biotech nanotech or other lowerlevel systems ai is the brains of the operation of course this doesnt automatically imply that ai should be the primary focus of our attention maybe other revolutionary technologies or social forces will come first and deserve higher priority in practice i think focusing on ai specifically seems quite important even relative to competing scenarios but its good to explore many areas in parallel to at least a shallow depthin addition i dont see a sharp distinction between ai and other fields progress in ai software relies heavily on computer hardware and it depends at least a little bit on other fundamentals of computer science like programming languages operating systems distributed systems and networks ai also shares significant overlap with neuroscience this is especially true if whole brain emulation arrives before bottomup ai and everything else in society matters a lot too how intelligent and engineeringoriented are citizens how much do governments fund ai and cognitivescience research id encourage less rather than more what kinds of military and commercial applications are being developed are other industrial backbone components of society stable what memetic lenses does society have for understanding and grappling with these trends and so on the ai story is part of a larger story of social and technological change in which one part influences other partssignificant trends in ai may not look like the ai we see in movies they may not involve animallike cognitive agents as much as more boring businessoriented computing systems some of the most transformative computer technologies in the period 20002014 have been drones smart phones and social networking these all involve some ai but the ai is mostly used as a component of a larger nonai system in which many other facets of software engineering play at least as much of a rolenonetheless it seems nearly inevitable to me that digital intelligence in some form will eventually leave biological humans in the dust if technological progress continues without faltering this is almost obvious when we zoom out and notice that the history of life on earth consists in one species outcompeting another over and over again ecologys competitive exclusion principle suggests that in the long run either humans or machines will ultimately occupy the role of the most intelligent beings on the planet since when one species has even the slightest advantage or edge over another then the one with the advantage will dominate in the long termthe basic premise of superintelligent machines who have different priorities than their creators has been in public consciousness for many decades arguably even frankenstein published in 1818 expresses this basic idea though more modern forms include 2001 a space odyssey 1968 the terminator 1984 i robot 2004 and many more probably most people in western countries have at least heard of these ideas if not watched or read pieces of fiction on the topicso why do most people including many of societys elites ignore strong ai as a serious issue one reason is just that the world is really big and there are many important and notsoimportant issues that demand attention many people think strong ai is too far off and we should focus on nearerterm problems in addition its possible that science fiction itself is part of the reason people may write off ai scenarios as just science fiction as i would have done prior to late 2005 of course this is partly for good reason since depictions of ai in movies are usually very unrealistic often citing hollywood is taken as a thoughtstopping deflection of the possibility of ai getting out of control without much in the way of substantive argument to back up that stance for example lets please keep the discussion firmly within the realm of reason and leave the robot uprisings to hollywood screenwritersas ai progresses i find it hard to imagine that mainstream society will ignore the topic forever perhaps awareness will accrue gradually or perhaps an ai sputnik moment will trigger an avalanche of interest stuart russell expects thatjust as nuclear fusion researchers consider the problem of containment of fusion reactions as one of the primary problems of their field it seems inevitable that issues of control and safety will become central to ai as the field maturesi think its likely that issues of ai policy will be debated heavily in the coming decades although its possible that ai will be like nuclear weapons something that everyone is afraid of but that countries cant stop because of armsrace dynamics so even if ai proceeds slowly theres probably value in thinking more about these issues well ahead of time though i wouldnt consider the counterfactual value of doing so to be astronomical compared with other projects in part because society will pick up the slack as the topic becomes more prominentvarious thinkers have debated the likelihood of a hard takeoff in which a single computer or set of computers rapidly becomes superintelligent on its own compared with a soft takeoff in which society as a whole is transformed by ai in a more distributed continuous fashion the hansonyudkowsky aifoom debate discusses this in great detail the topic has also been considered by many others such as ramez naam vs william hertlingfor a long time i inclined toward yudkowskys vision of ai because i respect his opinions and didnt ponder the details too closely this is also the more prototypical example of rebellious ai in science fiction in early 2014 a friend of mine challenged this view noting that computing power is a severe limitation for humanlevel minds my friend suggested that ai advances would be slow and would diffuse through society rather than remaining in the hands of a single developer team as ive read more ai literature i think this softtakeoff view is pretty likely to be correct science is always a gradual process and almost all ai innovations historically have moved in tiny steps i would guess that even the evolution of humans from their primate ancestors was a soft takeoff in the sense that no single son or daughter was vastly more intelligent than his or her parents the evolution of technology in general has been fairly continuous i probably agree with paul christiano that it is unlikely that there will be rapid discontinuous and unanticipated developments in ai that catapult it to superhuman levelsof course its not guaranteed that ai innovations will diffuse throughout society at some point perhaps governments will take control in the style of the manhattan project and theyll keep the advances secret but even then i expect that the internal advances by the research teams will add cognitive abilities in small steps even if you have a theoretically optimal intelligence algorithm its constrained by computing resources so you either need lots of hardware or approximation hacks or most likely both before it can function effectively in the highdimensional state space of the real world and this again implies a slower trajectory marcus hutters aixitl is an example of a theoretically optimal general intelligence but most ai researchers feel it wont work for artificial general intelligence agi because its astronomically expensive to compute ben goertzel explains i think that tells you something interesting it tells you that dealing with resource restrictions with the boundedness of time and space resources is actually critical to intelligence if you lift the restriction to do things efficiently then ai and agi are trivial problems1in i still don’t get foom robin hanson contendsyes sometimes architectural choices have wider impacts but i was an artificial intelligence researcher for nine years ending twenty years ago and i never saw an architecture choice make a huge difference relative to other reasonable architecture choices for most big systems overall architecture matters a lot less than getting lots of detail rightthis suggests that its unlikely that a single insight will make an astronomical difference to an ais performancesimilarly my experience is that machinelearning algorithms matter less than the data theyre trained on i think this is a general sentiment among data scientists theres a famous slogan that more data is better data a main reason googles performance is so good is that it has so many users that even obscure searches spelling mistakes etc will appear somewhere in its logs but if many performance gains come from data then theyre constrained by hardware which generally grows steadilyhansons i still don’t get foom post continues to be much better at learning the project would instead have to be much better at hundreds of specific kinds of learning which is very hard to do in a small project anders sandberg makes a similar pointas the amount of knowledge grows it becomes harder and harder to keep up and to get an overview necessitating specialization this means that a development project might need specialists in many areas which in turns means that there is a lower size of a group able to do the development in turn this means that it is very hard for a small group to get far ahead of everybody else in all areas simply because it will not have the necessary know how in all necessary areas the solution is of course to hire it but that will enlarge the groupone of the more convincing antifoom arguments is j storrs halls point that an ai improving itself to a world superpower would need to outpace the entire world economy of 7 billion people plus natural resources and physical capital it would do much better to specialize sell its services on the market and acquire powerwealth in the ways that most people do there are plenty of powerhungry people in the world but usually they go to wall street k street or silicon valley rather than trying to build worlddomination plans in their basement why would an ai be different some possibilitiesim skeptical of 1 though i suppose if the ai is very alien these kinds of unknown unknowns become more plausible 2 is an interesting point it seems like a pretty good way to spread yourself as an ai is to become a useful software product that lots of people want to install ie to sell your services on the world market as hall said of course once thats done perhaps the ai could find a way to take over the world maybe it could silently quash competitor ai projects maybe it could hack into computers worldwide via the internet and internet of things as the ai did in the delete series maybe it could devise a way to convince humans to give it access to sensitive control systems as skynet did in terminator 3i find these kinds of scenarios for ai takeover more plausible than a rapidly selfimproving superintelligence indeed even a humanlevel intelligence that can distribute copies of itself over the internet might be able to take control of human infrastructure and hence take over the world no foom is requiredrather than discussing hardvssoft takeoff arguments more here i added discussion to wikipedia where the content will receive greater readership see hard vs soft takeoff in intelligence explosionthe hard vs soft distinction is obviously a matter of degree and maybe how long the process takes isnt the most relevant way to slice the space of scenarios for practical purposes the more relevant question is should we expect control of ai outcomes to reside primarily in the hands of a few seed ai developers in this case altruists should focus on influencing a core group of ai experts or maybe their military corporate leaders or should we expect that society as a whole will play a big role in shaping how ai is developed and used in this case governance structures social dynamics and nontechnical thinkers will play an important role not just in influencing how much ai research happens but also in how the technologies are deployed and incrementally shaped as they matureits possible that one country perhaps the united states or maybe china in later decades will lead the way in ai development especially if the research becomes nationalized when ai technology grows more powerful would this country then take over the world im not sure the united states had a monopoly on nuclear weapons for several years after 1945 but it didnt bomb the soviet union out of existence a country with a monopoly on artificial superintelligence might refrain from destroying its competitors as well on the other hand ai should enable vastly more sophisticated surveillance and control than was possible in the 1940s so a monopoly might be sustainable even without resorting to drastic measures in any case perhaps a country with superintelligence would just economically outcompete the rest of the world rendering military power superfluousbesides a single country taking over the world the other possibility perhaps more likely is that ai is developed in a distributed fashion either openly as is the case in academia today or in secret by governments as is the case with other weapons of mass destructioneven in a softtakeoff case there would come a point at which humans would be unable to keep up with the pace of ai thinking we already see an instance of this with algorithmic stocktrading systems although human traders are still needed for more complex tasks right now the reins of power would have to be transitioned to faster human uploads trusted ais built from scratch or some combination of the two in a slow scenario there might be many intelligent systems at comparable levels of performance maintaining a balance of power at least for a while2 in the long run a singleton seems plausible because computers unlike human kings can reprogram their servants to want to obey their bidding which means that as an agent gains more central authority its not likely to later lose it by internal rebellion only by external aggression also evolutionary competition is not a stable state while a singleton is it seems likely that evolution will eventually lead to a singleton at one point or other—whether because one faction takes over the world or because the competing factions form a stable cooperation agreement—and competition wont return after that happens that said if the singleton is merely a contingent cooperation agreement among factions that still disagree one can imagine that cooperation breaking down in the futuremost of humanitys problems are fundamentally coordination problems selfishness problems if humans were perfectly altruistic we could easily eliminate poverty overpopulation war arms races and other social ills there would remain man vs nature problems but these are increasingly disappearing as technology advances assuming a digital singleton emerges the chances of it going extinct seem very small except due to alien invasions or other external factors because unless the singleton has a very myopic utility function it should consider carefully all the consequences of its actions in contrast to the fools rush in approach that humanity currently takes toward most technological risks due to wanting the benefits of and profits from technology right away and not wanting to lose out to competitors for this reason i suspect that most of george dvorskys 12 ways humanity could destroy the entire solar system are unlikely to happen since most of them presuppose blundering by an advanced earthoriginating intelligence but probably by the time earthoriginating intelligence would be able to carry out interplanetary engineering on a nontrivial scale well already have a digital singleton that thoroughly explores the risks of its actions before executing them that said this might not be true if competing ais begin astroengineering before a singleton is completely formed by the way i should point out that i prefer it if the cosmos isnt successfully colonized because doing so is likely to astronomically multiply sentience and therefore sufferingsometimes its claimed that we should expect a hard takeoff because aidevelopment dynamics will fundamentally change once ais can start improving themselves one stylized way to explain this is via differential equations let it be the intelligence of ais at time tluke muehlhauser reports that the idea of intelligence explosion once machines can start improving themselves ran me over like a train not because it was absurd but because it was clearly true i think this kind of exponential feedback loop is the basis behind many of the intelligenceexplosion argumentsbut lets think about this more carefully whats so special about the point where machines can understand and modify themselves certainly understanding your own source code helps you improve yourself but humans already understand the source code of presentday ais with an eye toward improving it moreover presentday ais are vastly simpler than humanlevel ones will be and presentday ais are far less intelligent than the humans who create them which is easier 1 improving the intelligence of something as smart as you or 2 improving the intelligence of something far dumber 2 is usually easier so if anything ai intelligence should be exploding faster now because it can be lifted up by something vastly smarter than it once ais need to improve themselves theyll have to pull up on their own bootstraps without the guidance of an already existing model of far superior intelligence on which to base their designsas an analogy its harder to produce novel developments if youre the marketleading company its easier if youre a competitor trying to catch up because you know what to aim for and what kinds of designs to reverseengineer ai right now is like a competitor trying to catch up to the market leaderanother way to say this the constants in the differential equations might be important even if human aidevelopment progress is linear that progress might be faster than a slow exponential curve until some point far later where the exponential catches upin any case im cautious of simple differential equations like these why should the rate of intelligence increase be proportional to the intelligence level maybe the problems become much harder at some point maybe the systems become fiendishly complicated such that even small improvements take a long time robin hanson echoes this suggestionstudents get smarter as they learn more and learn how to learn however we teach the most valuable concepts first and the productivity value of schooling eventually falls off instead of exploding to infinity similarly the productivity improvement of factory workers typically slows with time following a power law at the world level average iq scores have increased dramatically over the last century the flynn effect as the world has learned better ways to think and to teach nevertheless iqs have improved steadily instead of accelerating similarly for decades computer and communication aids have made engineers much smarter without accelerating moores law while engineers got smarter their design tasks got harderalso ask yourself this question why do startups exist part of the answer is that they can innovate faster than big companies due to having less institutional baggage and legacy software3 its harder to make radical changes to big systems than small systems of course like the economy does a selfimproving ai could create its own virtual startups to experiment with more radical changes but just as in the economy it might take a while to prove new concepts and then transition old systems to the new and better modelsin discussions of intelligence explosion its common to approximate ai productivity as scaling linearly with number of machines but this may or may not be true depending on the degree of parallelizability empirical examples for humanengineered projects show diminishing returns with more workers and while computers may be better able to partition work due to greater uniformity and speed of communication there will remain some overhead in parallelization some tasks may be inherently nonparalellizable preventing the kinds of everfaster performance that the most extreme explosion scenarios envisagefred brookss no silver bullet paper argued that there is no single development in either technology or management technique which by itself promises even one order of magnitude improvement within a decade in productivity in reliability in simplicity likewise wirths law reminds us of how fast software complexity can grow these points make it seem less plausible that an ai system could rapidly bootstrap itself to superintelligence using just a few key asyetundiscovered insightschollet 2017 notes that even if one part of a system has the ability to recursively selfimprove other parts of the system will inevitably start acting as bottlenecks we might compare this with liebigs law of the minimum growth is dictated not by total resources available but by the scarcest resource limiting factor individual sectors of the human economy can show rapid growth at various times but the growth rate of the entire economy is more limitedeventually there has to be a leveling off of intelligence increase if only due to physical limits on the other hand one argument in favor of differential equations is that the economy has fairly consistently followed exponential trends since humans evolved though the exponential growth rate of todays economy remains small relative to what we typically imagine from an intelligence explosioni think a stronger case for intelligence explosion is the clockspeed difference between biological and digital minds even if ai development becomes very slow in subjective years once ais take it over in objective years ie revolutions around the sun the pace will continue to look blazingly fast but if enough of society is digital by that point including humaninspired subroutines and maybe full digital humans then digital speedup wont give a unique advantage to a single ai project that can then take over the world hence hard takeoff in the sci fi sense still isnt guaranteed also hanson argues that faster minds would produce a onetime jump in economic output but not necessarily a sustained higher rate of growthanother case for intelligence explosion is that intelligence growth might not be driven by the intelligence of a given agent so much as by the collective manhours or machinehours that would become possible with more resources i suspect that ai research could accelerate at least 10 times if it had 1050 times more funding this is not the same as saying i want funding increased in fact i probably want funding decreased to give society more time to sort through these issues the population of digital minds that could be created in a few decades might exceed the biological human population which would imply faster progress if only by numerosity also the digital minds might not need to sleep would focus intently on their assigned tasks etc however once again these are advantages in objective time rather than collective subjective time and these advantages would not be uniquely available to a single firstmover ai project any wealthy and technologically sophisticated group that wasnt too far behind the cutting edge could amplify its ai development in this waya few weeks after writing this section i learned that ch 4 of nick bostroms superintelligence paths dangers strategies contains surprisingly similar content even up to the use of didt as the symbols in a differential equation however bostrom comes down mostly in favor of the likelihood of an intelligence explosion i reply to bostroms arguments in the next sectionnote søren elverlin replies to this section in a video presentation i agree with some of his points and disagree with othersin ch 4 of superintelligence bostrom suggests several factors that might lead to a hard or at least semihard takeoff i dont fully disagree with his points and because these are difficult issues i agree that bostrom might be right but i want to play devils advocate and defend the softtakeoff view ive distilled and paraphrased what i think are 6 core arguments and i reply to each in turn1 there might be a key missing algorithmic insight that allows for dramatic progressmaybe but do we have much precedent for this as far as im aware all individual ai advances and indeed most technology advances in general have not represented astronomical improvements over previous designs maybe connectionist ai systems represented a gamechanging improvement relative to symbolic ai for messy tasks like vision but im not sure how much of an improvement they represented relative to the best alternative technologies after all neural networks are in some sense just fancier forms of preexisting statistical methods like logistic regression and even neural networks came in stages with the perceptron multilayer networks backpropagation recurrent networks deep networks etc the most groundbreaking machinelearning advances may reduce error rates by a half or something which may be commercially very important but this is not many orders of magnitude as hardtakeoff scenarios tend to assumeoutside of ai the internet changed the world but it was an accumulation of many insights facebook has had massive impact but it too was built from many small parts and grew in importance slowly as its size increased microsoft became a virtual monopoly in the 1990s but perhaps more for business than technology reasons and its power in the software industry at large is probably not growing google has a quasimonopoly on web search kicked off by the success of pagerank but most of its improvements have been small and gradual google has grown very powerful but it hasnt maintained a permanent advantage that would allow it to take over the software industryacquiring nuclear weapons might be the closest example of a single discrete step that most dramatically changes a countrys position but this may be an outlier maybe other advances in weaponry arrows guns etc historically have had somewhat dramatic effectsbostrom doesnt present specific arguments for thinking that a few crucial insights may produce radical jumps he suggests that we might not notice a systems improvements until it passes a threshold but this seems absurd because at least the ai developers would need to be intimately acquainted with the ais performance while not strictly accurate theres a slogan you cant improve what you cant measure maybe the ais progress wouldnt make world headlines but the academicindustrial community would be well aware of nontrivial breakthroughs and the ai developers would live and breathe performance numbers2 once an ai passes a threshold it might be able to absorb vastly more content eg by reading the internet that was previously inaccessibleabsent other concurrent improvements im doubtful this would produce takeovertheworld superintelligence because the worlds current superintelligence namely humanity as a whole already has read most of the internet indeed has written it i guess humans havent read all automatically generated text or vast streams of numerical data but the insights gleaned purely from reading such material would be low without doing more sophisticated data mining and learning on top of it and presumably such data mining would have already been in progress well before bostroms hypothetical ai learned how to readin any case i doubt reading with understanding is such an allornothing activity that it can suddenly turn on once the ai achieves a certain ability level as bostrom says p 71 reading with the comprehension of a 10yearold is probably aicomplete ie requires solving the general ai problem so assuming that you can switch on reading ability with one improvement is equivalent to assuming that a single insight can produce astronomical gains in ai performance which we discussed above if thats not true and if before the ai system with 10yearold reading ability was an ai system with a 6yearold reading ability why wouldnt that ai have already devoured the internet and before that why wouldnt a protoreader have devoured a version of the internet that had been processed to make it easier for a machine to understand and so on until we get to the presentday textrunner system that bostrom cites which is already devouring the internet it doesnt make sense that massive amounts of content would only be added after lots of improvements commercial incentives tend to yield exactly the opposite effect converting the system to a largescale product when even modest gains appear because these may be enough to snatch a market advantagethe fundamental point is that i dont think theres a crucial set of components to general intelligence that all need to be in place before the whole thing works its hard to evolve systems that require all components to be in place at once which suggests that human general intelligence probably evolved gradually i expect its possible to get partial agi with partial implementations of the components of general intelligence and the components can gradually be made more general over time components that are lacking can be supplemented by humanbased computation and narrowai hacks until more general solutions are discovered compare with minimum viable products and agile software development as a result society should be upended by partial agi innovations many times over the coming decades well before fully humanlevel agi is finished3 once a system proves its mettle by attaining humanlevel intelligence funding for hardware could multiplyi agree that funding for ai could multiply manyfold due to a sudden change in popular attention or political dynamics but im thinking of something like a factor of 10 or maybe 50 in an allout cold warstyle arms race a factorof50 boost in hardware isnt obviously that important if before there was one humanlevel ai there would now be 50 in any case i expect the sputnik moments for ai to happen well before it achieves a human level of ability companies and militaries arent stupid enough not to invest massively in an ai with almosthuman intelligence4 once the human level of intelligence is reached researchers may work harder and more researchers may be recruitedas with hardware above i would expect these shit hits the fan moments to happen before fully humanlevel ai in any case5 at some point the ais selfimprovements would dominate those of human engineers leading to exponential growthi discussed this in the intelligence explosion section above a main point is that we see many other systems such as the world economy or moores law that also exhibit positive feedback and hence exponential growth but these arent fooming at an astounding rate its not clear why an ais selfimprovement which resembles economic growth and other complex phenomena should suddenly explode faster in subjective time than humanitys existing recursiveself improvement of its intelligence via digital computationon the other hand maybe the difference between subjective and objective time is important if a humanlevel ai could think say 10000 times faster than a human then assuming linear scaling it would be worth 10000 engineers by the time of humanlevel ai i expect there would be far more than 10000 ai developers on earth but given enough hardware the ai could copy itself manyfold until its subjective time far exceeded that of human experts the speed and copiability advantages of digital minds seem perhaps the strongest arguments for a takeoff that happens rapidly relative to human observers note that as hanson said above this digital speedup might be just a onetime boost rather than a permanently higher rate of growth but even the onetime boost could be enough to radically alter the power dynamics of humans visàvis machines that said there should be plenty of slightly subhuman ais by this time and maybe they could fill some speed gaps on behalf of biological humansin general its a mistake to imagine humanlevel ai against a backdrop of our current world thats like imagining a tyrannosaurus rex in a human city rather the world will look very different by the time humanlevel ai arrives before ai can exceed human performance in all domains it will exceed human performance in many narrow domains gradually and these narrowdomain ais will help humans respond quickly for example a narrow ai thats an expert at military planning based on war games can help humans with possible military responses to rogue aismany of the intermediate steps on the path to general ai will be commercially useful and thus should diffuse widely in the meanwhile as user hungryhobo noted if you had a near human level ai odds are everything that could be programmed into it at the start to help it with software development is already going to be part of the suites of tools for helping normal human programmers even if ai research becomes nationalized and confidential its developers should still have access to almosthumanlevel digitalspeed ai tools which should help smooth the transition for instance bostrom mentions how in the 2010 flash crash box 2 p 17 a highspeed positivefeedback spiral was terminated by a highspeed circuit breaker this is already an example where problems happening faster than humans could comprehend them were averted due to solutions happening faster than humans could comprehend them see also the discussion of tripwires in superintelligence p 137conversely many globally disruptive events may happen well before fully human ai arrives since even subhuman ai may be prodigiously powerful6 even when the outside world has a greater total amount of relevant research capability than any one project the optimization power of the project might be more important than that of the world since much of the outside worlds capability is not be focused on the particular system in question hence the project might take off and leave the world behind box 4 p 75what one makes of this argument depends on how many people are needed to engineer how much progress the watson system that played on jeopardy required 15 people over 4 years4 given the existing tools of the rest of the world at that time which had been developed by millions indeed billions of other people watson was a much smaller leap forward than that needed to give a general intelligence a takeovertheworld advantage how many more people would be required to achieve such a radical leap in intelligence this seems to be a main point of contention in the debate between believers in soft vs hard takeoffcan we get insight into how hard general intelligence is based on neuroscience is the human brain fundamentally simple or complexjeff hawkins andrew ng and others speculate that the brain may have one fundamental algorithm for intelligence deep learning in the cortical column this idea gains plausibility from the brains plasticity for instance blind people can appropriate the visual cortex for auditory processing artificial neural networks can be used to classify any kind of input not just visual and auditory but even highly abstract like features about creditcard fraud or stock pricesmaybe theres one fundamental algorithm for input classification but this doesnt imply one algorithm for all that the brain does beyond the cortical column the brain has many specialized structures that seem to perform very specialized functions such as reward learning in the basal ganglia fear processing in the amygdala etc of course its not clear how essential all of these parts are or how easy it would be to replace them with artificial components performing the same basic functionsone argument for faster agi takeoffs is that humans have been able to learn many sophisticated things eg advanced mathematics music writing programming without requiring any genetic changes and what we now know doesnt seem to represent any kind of limit to what we could know with more learning the human collection of cognitive algorithms is very flexible which seems to belie claims that all intelligence requires specialized designs on the other hand even if human genes havent changed much in the last 10000 years human culture has evolved substantially and culture undergoes slow trialanderror evolution in similar ways as genes do so one could argue that human intellectual achievements are not fully general but rely on a vast amount of specialized evolved content just as a single random human isolated from society probably couldnt develop general relativity on his own in a lifetime so a single random humanlevel agi probably couldnt either culture is the new genome and it progresses slowlymoreover some scholars believe that certain human abilities such as language are very essentially based on genetic hardwiringthe approach taken by chomsky and marr toward understanding how our minds achieve what they do is as different as can be from behaviorism the emphasis here is on the internal structure of the system that enables it to perform a task rather than on external association between past behavior of the system and the environment the goal is to dig into the black box that drives the system and describe its inner workings much like how a computer scientist would explain how a cleverly designed piece of software works and how it can be executed on a desktop computerchomsky himself notestheres a fairly recent book by a very good cognitive neuroscientist randy gallistel and king arguing in my view plausibly that neuroscience developed kind of enthralled to associationism and related views of the way humans and animals work and as a result theyve been looking for things that have the properties of associationist psychologymany parts of the human body like the digestive system or bonesmuscles are extremely complex and finetuned yet few people argue that their development is controlled by learning so its not implausible that a lot of the brains basic architecture could be similarly hardcodedtypically agi researchers express scorn for manually tuned software algorithms that dont rely on fully general learning but chomskys stance challenges that sentiment if chomsky is right then a good portion of human general intelligence is finely tuned hardcoded software of the sort that we see in nonai branches of software engineering and this view would suggest a slower agi takeoff because time and experimentation are required to tune all the detailed specific algorithms of intelligencea fullfledged superintelligence probably requires very complex design but it may be possible to build a seed ai that would recursively selfimprove toward superintelligence alan turing proposed this in his 1950 computing machinery and intelligenceinstead of trying to produce a programme to simulate the adult mind why not rather try to produce one which simulates the childs if this were then subjected to an appropriate course of education one would obtain the adult brain presumably the child brain is something like a notebook as one buys it from the stationers rather little mechanism and lots of blank sheets mechanism and writing are from our point of view almost synonymous our hope is that there is so little mechanism in the child brain that something like it can be easily programmedanimal development appears to be at least somewhat robust based on the fact that the growing organisms are often functional despite a few genetic mutations and variations in prenatal and postnatal environments such variations may indeed make an impact eg healthier development conditions tend to yield more physically attractive adults but most humans mature successfully over a wide range of input conditionson the other hand an argument against the simplicity of development is the immense complexity of our dna it accumulated over billions of years through vast numbers of evolutionary experiments its not clear that human engineers could perform enough measurements to tune ontogenetic parameters of a seed ai in a short period of time and even if the parameter settings worked for early development they would probably fail for later development rather than a seed ai developing into an adult all at once designers would develop the ai in small steps since each next stage of development would require significant tuning to get rightthink about how much effort is required for human engineers to build even relatively simple systems for example i think the number of developers who work on microsoft office is in the thousands microsoft office is complex but is still far simpler than a mammalian brain brains have lots of little parts that have been finetuned that kind of complexity requires immense work by software developers to create the main counterargument is that there may be a simple metaalgorithm that would allow an ai to bootstrap to the point where it could finetune all the details on its own without requiring human inputs this might be the case but my guess is that any elegant solution would be hugely expensive computationally for instance biological evolution was able to finetune the human brain but it did so with immense amounts of computing power over millions of yearsa common analogy for the gulf between superintelligence vs humans is that between humans vs chimpanzees in consciousness explained daniel dennett mentions pp 189190 how our hominid ancestors had brains roughly four times the volume as those of chimps but roughly the same in structure this might incline one to imagine that brain size alone could yield superintelligence maybe wed just need to quadruple human brains once again to produce superintelligent humans if so wouldnt this imply a hard takeoff since quadrupling hardware is relatively easybut in fact as dennett explains the quadrupling of brain size from chimps to prehumans completed before the advent of language cooking agriculture etc in other words the main foom of humans came from culture rather than brain size per se from software in addition to hardware yudkowsky seems to agree humans have around four times the brain volume of chimpanzees but the difference between us is probably mostly brainlevel cognitive algorithmsbut cultural changes software arguably progress a lot more slowly than hardware the intelligence of human society has grown exponentially but its a slow exponential and rarely have there been innovations that allowed one group to quickly overpower everyone else within the same region of the world between isolated regions of the world the situation was sometimes different eg europeans with maxim guns overpowering africans because of very different levels of industrializationsome including owen cottonbarratt and toby ord have argued that even if we think soft takeoffs are more likely there may be higher value in focusing on hardtakeoff scenarios because these are the cases in which society would have the least forewarning and the fewest people working on ai altruism issues this is a reasonable point but i would add thatin any case the hardsoft distinction is not binary and maybe the best place to focus is on scenarios where humanlevel ai takes over on a time scale of a few years timescales of months days or hours strike me as pretty improbable unless say skynet gets control of nuclear weaponsin superintelligence nick bostrom suggests ch 4 p 64 that most preparations undertaken before onset of a slow takeoff would be rendered obsolete as better solutions would gradually become visible in the light of the dawning era toby ord uses the term nearsightedness to refer to the ways in which research too far in advance of an issues emergence may not as useful as research when more is known about the issue ord contrasts this with benefits of starting early including coursesetting i think ords counterpoints argue against the contention that early work wouldnt matter that much in a slow takeoff some of how society responded to ai surpassing human intelligence might depend on early frameworks and memes for instance consider the lingering impact of terminator imagery on almost any presentday popularmedia discussion of ai risk some fundamental work would probably not be overthrown by later discoveries for instance algorithmiccomplexity bounds of key algorithms were discovered decades ago but will remain relevant until intelligence dies out possibly billions of years from now some nontechnical policy and philosophy work would be less obsoleted by changing developments and some ai preparation would be relevant both in the short term and the long term slow ai takeoff to reach the human level is already happening and more minds should be exploring these questions well in advancemaking a related though slightly different point bostrom argues in superintelligence ch 5 pp 8586 that individuals might play more of a role in cases where elites and governments underestimate the significance of ai activists seeking maximum expected impact may therefore wish to focus most of their planning on scenarios where governments come late to the game even if they believe that scenarios in which big players end up calling all the shots are more probable again i would qualify this with the note that we shouldnt confuse acting as if governments will come late with believing they actually will come late when thinking about most likely future scenarioseven if one does wish to bet on lowprobability highimpact scenarios of fast takeoff and governmental neglect this doesnt speak to whether or how we should push on takeoff speed and governmental attention themselves following are a few considerationstakeoff speedamount of governmentpopular attention to aione of the strongest arguments for hard takeoff is this one by yudkowskythe distance from village idiot to einstein is tiny in the space of brain designsor as scott alexander put itit took evolution twenty million years to go from cows with sharp horns to hominids with sharp spears it took only a few tens of thousands of years to go from hominids with sharp spears to moderns with nuclear weaponsi think we shouldnt take relative evolutionary timelines at face value because most of the previous 20 million years of mammalian evolution werent focused on improving human intelligence most of the evolutionary selection pressure was directed toward optimizing other traits in contrast cultural evolution places greater emphasis on intelligence because that trait is more important in human society than it is in most animal fitness landscapesstill the overall point is important the tweaks to a brain needed to produce humanlevel intelligence may not be huge compared with the designs needed to produce chimp intelligence but the differences in the behaviors of the two systems when placed in a sufficiently informationrich environment are hugenonetheless i incline toward thinking that the transition from humanlevel ai to an ai significantly smarter than all of humanity combined would be somewhat gradual requiring at least years if not decades because the absolute scale of improvements needed would still be immense and would be limited by hardware capacity but if hardware becomes many orders of magnitude more efficient than it is today then things could indeed move more rapidlyanother important criticism of the village idiot point is that it lacks context while a village idiot in isolation will not produce rapid progress toward superintelligence one einstein plus a million village idiots working for him can produce ai progress much faster than one einstein alone the narrowintelligence software tools that we build are dumber than village idiots in isolation but collectively when deployed in thoughtful ways by smart humans they allow humans to achieve much more than einstein by himself with only pencil and paper this observation weakens the idea of a phase transition when humanlevel ai is developed because villageidiotlevel ais in the hands of humans will already be achieving superhuman levels of performance if we think of human intelligence as the number 1 and humanlevel ai that can build smarter ai as the number 2 then rather than imagining a transition from 1 to 2 at one crucial point we should think of our dumb software tools as taking us to 11 then 12 then 13 and so on my thinking on this point was inspired by ramez naammany of the most impressive ai achievements of the 2010s were improvements at game play both video games like atari games and boardcard games like go and poker some people infer from these accomplishments that agi may not be far off i think performance in these simple games doesnt give much evidence that a worldconquering agi could arise within a decade or twoa main reason is that most of the games at which ai has excelled have had simple rules and a limited set of possible actions at each turn russell and norvig 2003 pp 16162 for ai researchers the abstract nature of games makes them an appealing subject for study the state of a game is easy to represent and agents are usually restricted to a small number of actions whose outcomes are defined by precise rules in games like space invaders or go you can see the entire world at once and represent it as a twodimensional grid5 you can also consider all possible actions at a given turn for example alphagos policy networks gave a probability value for each possible legal move ie the output of the network is as large as the board as summarized by burger 2016 likewise deepminds deep qnetwork for playing atari games had a single output for each valid action mnih et al 2015 p 530in contrast the state space of the world is enormous heterogeneous not easily measured and not easily represented in a simple twodimensional grid plus the number of possible actions that one can take at any given moment is almost unlimited for instance even just considering actions of the form print to the screen a string of uppercase or lowercase alphabetical characters fewer than 50 characters long the number of possibilities for what text to print out is larger than the number of atoms in the observable universe6 these problems seem to require hierarchical world models and hierarchical planning of actions—allowing for abstraction of complexity into simplified and highlevel conceptualizations—as well as the data structures learning algorithms and simulation capabilities on which such world models and plans can be basedsome people may be impressed that alphago uses intuition ie deep neural networks like human players do and doesnt rely purely on bruteforce search and handcrafted heuristic evaluation functions the way that deep blue did to win at chess but the idea that computers can have intuition is nothing new since thats what most machinelearning classifiers are aboutmachine learning especially supervised machine learning is very popular these days compared against other aspects of ai perhaps this is because unlike most other parts of ai machine learning can easily be commercialized but even if visual auditory and other sensory recognition can be replicated by machine learning this doesnt get us to agi in my opinion the hard part of agi or at least the part we havent made as much progress on is how to hook together various narrowai modules and abilities into a more generally intelligent agent that can figure out what abilities to deploy in various contexts in pursuit of higherlevel goals hierarchical planning in complex worlds rich semantic networks and general common sense in various flavors still seem largely absent from many stateoftheart ai systems as far as i can tell i dont think these are problems that you can just bypass by scaling up deep reinforcement learning or somethingkaufman 2017a says regarding a conversation with professor bryce wiedenbeck bryce thinks there are deep questions about what intelligence really is that we dont understand yet and that as we make progress on those questions well develop very different sorts of machinelearning systems if something like todays deep learning is still a part of what we eventually end up with its more likely to be something that solves specific problems than as a critical component personally i think deep learning or something functionally analogous to it is likely to remain a big component of future ai systems two lines of evidence for this view are that 1 supervised machine learning has been a cornerstone of ai for decades and 2 animal brains including the human cortex seem to rely crucially on something like deep learning for sensory processing however i agree with bryce that there remain big parts of human intelligence that arent captured by even a scaled up version of deep learningi also largely agree with michael littmans expectations as described by kaufman 2017b i asked him what he thought of the idea that to we could get agi with current techniques primarily deep neural nets and reinforcement learning without learning anything new about how intelligence works or how to implement it he didnt think this was possible and believes there are deep conceptual issues we still need to get a handle onmerritt 2017 quotes stuart russell as saying that modern neural nets lack the expressive power of programming languages and declarative semantics that make database systems logic programming and knowledge systems useful russell believes we have at least half a dozen major breakthroughs to come before we get to aiyudkowsky 2016a discusses some interesting insights from alphagos matches against lee sedol and deepmind more generally he saysalphago’s core is built around a similar machine learning technology to deepmind’s atariplaying system – the single untweaked program that was able to learn superhuman play on dozens of different atari games just by looking at the pixels without specialization for each particular game in the atari case we didn’t see a bunch of different companies producing gameplayers for all the different varieties of game the atari case was an example of an event that robin hanson called “architecture” and doubted and that i called “insight” because of their big architectural insight deepmind didn’t need to bring in lots of different human experts at all the different atari games to train their universal atari player deepmind just tossed all preexisting expertise because it wasn’t formatted in a way their insightful ai system could absorb and besides it was a lot easier to just recreate all the expertise from scratch using their universal atarilearning architecturei agree with yudkowsky that there are domains where a new general tool renders previous specialized tools obsolete all at once howeveryudkowsky 2016a continuesso far as i know alphago wasn’t built in collaboration with any of the commercial companies that built their own goplaying programs for sale the october architecture was simple and so far as i know incorporated very little in the way of all the particular tweaks that had built up the power of the best opensource go programs of the time judging by the october architecture after their big architectural insight deepmind mostly started over in the details though they did reuse the widely known core insight of monte carlo tree search deepmind didn’t need to trade with any other go companies or be part of an economy that traded polished cognitive modules because deepmind’s big insight let them leapfrog over all the detail work of their competitorsthis is a good point but i think its mainly a function of the limited complexity of the go problem with the exception of learning from human play alphago didnt require massive inputs of messy realworld data to succeed because its world was so simple go is the kind of problem where we would expect a single system to be able to perform well without trading for cognitive assistance realworld problems are more likely to depend upon external ai systems—eg when doing a web search for information no simple ai system that runs on just a few machines will reproduce the massive data or extensively finetuned algorithms of google search for the foreseeable future google search will always be an external polished cognitive module that needs to be traded for although google search is free for limited numbers of queries the same is true for many other cloud services especially those reliant upon huge amounts of data or specialized domain knowledge we see lots of specialization and trading of nonai cognitive modules such as hardware components software applications amazon web services etc and of course simple ais will for a long time depend upon the human economy to provide material goods and services including electricity cooling buildings security guards national defense etcestimating how long a software project will take to complete is notoriously difficult even if ive completed many similar coding tasks before when im asked to estimate the time to complete a new coding project my estimate is often wrong by a factor of 2 and sometimes wrong by a factor of 4 or even 10 insofar as the development of agi or other big technologies like nuclear fusion is a big software or more generally engineering project its unsurprising that wed see similarly dramatic failures of estimation on timelines for these biggerscale achievementsa corollary is that we should maintain some modesty about agi timelines and takeoff speeds if say 100 years is your median estimate for the time until some agreedupon form of agi then theres a reasonable chance youll be off by a factor of 2 suggesting agi within 50 to 200 years and you might even be off by a factor of 4 suggesting agi within 25 to 400 years similar modesty applies for estimates of takeoff speed from humanlevel agi to superhuman agi although i think we can largely rule out extreme takeoff speeds like achieving performance far beyond human abilities within hours or days based on fundamental reasoning about the computational complexity of whats required to achieve superintelligencemy bias is generally to assume that a given technology will take longer to develop than what you hear about in the media a because of the planning fallacy and b because those who make more audacious claims are more interesting to report about believers in the singularity are not necessarily wrong about whats technically possible in the long term though sometimes they are but the reason enthusiastic singularitarians are considered crazy by more mainstream observers is that singularitarians expect change much faster than is realistic ai turned out to be much harder than the dartmouth conference participants expected likewise nanotech is progressing slower and more incrementally than the starryeyed proponents predictedmany naturelovers are charmed by the behavior of animals but find computers and robots to be cold and mechanical conversely some computer enthusiasts may find biology to be soft and boring compared with digital creations however the two domains share a surprising amount of overlap ideas of optimal control locomotion kinematics visual processing system regulation foraging behavior planning reinforcement learning etc have been fruitfully shared between biology and robotics neuroscientists sometimes look to the latest developments in ai to guide their theoretical models and ai researchers are often inspired by neuroscience such as with neural networks and in deciding what cognitive functionality to implementi think its helpful to see animals as being intelligent robots organic life has a wide diversity from unicellular organisms through humans and potentially beyond and so too can robotic life the rigid conceptual boundary that many people maintain between life and machines is not warranted by the underlying science of how the two types of systems work different types of intelligence may sometimes converge on the same basic kinds of cognitive operations and especially from a functional perspective when we look at what the systems can do rather than how they do it it seems to me intuitive that humanlevel robots would deserve humanlevel treatment even if their underlying algorithms were quite dissimilarwhether robot algorithms will in fact be dissimilar from those in human brains depends on how much biological inspiration the designers employ and how convergent humantype mind design is for being able to perform robotic tasks in a computationally efficient manner some classical robotics algorithms rely mostly on mathematical problem definition and optimization other modern robotics approaches use biologically plausible reinforcement learning andor evolutionary selection in one youtube video about robotics i saw that someone had written a comment to the effect that this shows that life needs an intelligent designer to be created the irony is that some of the best robotics techniques use evolutionary algorithms of course there are theists who say god used evolution but intervened at a few points and that would be an apt description of evolutionary roboticsthe distinction between ai and agi is somewhat misleading because it may incline one to believe that general intelligence is somehow qualitatively different from simpler ai in fact theres no sharp distinction there are just different machines whose abilities have different degrees of generality a critic of this claim might reply that bacteria would never have invented calculus my response is as follows most people couldnt have invented calculus from scratch either but over a long enough period of time eventually the collection of humans produced enough cultural knowledge to make the development possible likewise if you put bacteria on a planet long enough they too may develop calculus by first evolving into more intelligent animals who can then go on to do mathematics the difference here is a matter of degree the simpler machines that bacteria are take vastly longer to accomplish a given complex taskjust as earths history saw a plethora of animal designs before the advent of humans so i expect a wide assortment of animallike and plantlike robots to emerge in the coming decades well before humanlevel ai indeed weve already had basic robots for many decades or arguably even millennia these will grow gradually more sophisticated and as we converge on robots with the intelligence of birds and mammals ai and robotics will become dinnertable conversation topics of course i dont expect the robots to have the same sets of skills as existing animals deep blue had chessplaying abilities beyond any animal while in other domains it was less efficacious than a blade of grass robots can mix and match cognitive and motor abilities without strict regard for the order in which evolution created themand of course humans are robots too when i finally understood this around 2009 it was one of the biggest paradigm shifts of my life if i picture myself as a robot operating on an environment the world makes a lot more sense i also find this perspective can be therapeutic to some extent if i experience an unpleasant emotion i think about myself as a robot whose cognition has been temporarily afflicted by a negative stimulus and reinforcement process i then think how the robot has other cognitive processes that can counteract the suffering computations and prevent them from amplifying the ability to see myself from the outside as a thirdperson series of algorithms helps deflate the impact of unpleasant experiences because its easier to observe not judge when viewing a system in mechanistic terms compare with dialectical behavior therapy and mindfulnesswhen we use machines to automate a repetitive manual task formerly done by humans we talk about getting the task done automatically and for free because we say that no one has to do the work anymore of course this isnt strictly true the computerrobot now has to do the work maybe what we actually mean is that no one is going to get bored doing the work and we dont have to pay that worker high wages when intelligent humans do boring tasks its a waste of their spare cpu cyclessometimes we adopt a similar mindset about automation toward superintelligent machines in speculations concerning the first ultraintelligent machine 1965 i j good wrotelet an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever makeignoring the question of whether these future innovations are desirable we can ask does all ai design work after humans come for free it comes for free in the sense that humans arent doing it but the ais have to do it and it takes a lot of mental work on their parts given that theyre at least as intelligent as humans i think it doesnt make sense to picture them as mindless automatons rather they would have rich inner lives even if those inner lives have a very different nature than our own maybe they wouldnt experience the same effortfulness that humans do when innovating but even this isnt clear because measuring your effort in order to avoid spending too many resources on a task without payoff may be a useful design feature of ai minds too when we picture ourselves as robots along with our ai creations we can see that we are just one point along a spectrum of the growth of intelligence unicellular organisms when they evolved the first multicellular organism could likewise have said thats the last innovation we need to make the rest comes for freemovies typically portray rebellious robots or ais as the bad guys who need to be stopped by heroic humans this dichotomy plays on our usvsthem intuitions which favor our tribe against the evil alienlooking outsiders we see similar dynamics at play to a lesser degree when people react negatively against foreigners stealing our jobs or asians who are outcompeting us people dont want their kind to be replaced by another kind that has an advantagebut when we think about the situation from the ais perspective we might feel differently anthropomorphizing an ais thoughts is a recipe for trouble but regardless of the specific cognitive operations we can see at a high level that the ai feels in at least a poetic sense that what its trying to accomplish is the most important thing in the world and its trying to figure out how it can do that in the face of obstacles isnt this just what we do ourselvesthis is one reason it helps to really internalize the fact that we are robots too we have a variety of reward signals that drive us in various directions and we execute behavior aiming to increase those rewards many modernday robots have much simpler reward structures and so may seem more dull and less important than humans but its not clear this will remain true forever since navigating in a complex world probably requires a lot of specialcase heuristics and intermediate rewards at least until enough computing power becomes available for more systematic and thorough modelbased planning and action selectionsuppose an ai hypothetically eliminated humans and took over the world it would develop an array of robot assistants of various shapes and sizes to help it optimize the planet these would perform simple and complex tasks would interact with each other and would share information with the central ai command from an abstract perspective some of these dynamics might look like ecosystems in the present day except that they would lack interorganism competition other parts of the ais infrastructure might look more industrial depending on the ais goals perhaps it would be more effective to employ nanotechnology and programmable matter rather than macroscale robots the ai would develop virtual scientists to learn more about physics chemistry computer hardware and so on they would use experimental laboratory and measurement techniques but could also probe depths of structure that are only accessible via largescale computation digital engineers would plan how to begin colonizing the solar system they would develop designs for optimizing matter to create more computing power and for ensuring that those helper computing systems remained under control the ai would explore the depths of mathematics and ai theory proving beautiful theorems that it would value highly at least instrumentally the ai and its helpers would proceed to optimize the galaxy and beyond fulfilling their grandest hopes and dreamswhen phrased this way we might think that a rogue ai would not be so bad yes it would kill humans but compared against the ais vast future intelligence humans would be comparable to the ants on a field that get crushed when an art gallery is built on that land most people dont have qualms about killing a few ants to advance human goals an analogy of this sort is discussed in artificial intelligence a modern approach perhaps the ai analogy suggests a need to revise our ethical attitudes toward arthropods that said i happen to think that in this case ants on the whole benefit from the art gallerys construction because ant lives contain so much sufferingsome might object that sufficiently mathematical ais would not feel the happiness of accomplishing their dreams they wouldnt be conscious because they wouldnt have the high degree of network connectivity that human brains embody whether we agree with this assessment depends on how broadly we define consciousness and feelings to me it appears chauvinistic to adopt a view according to which an agent that has vastly more domaingeneral intelligence and agency than you is still not conscious in a morally relevant sense this seems to indicate a lack of openness to the diversity of mindspace what if you had grown up with the cognitive architecture of this different mind wouldnt you care about your goals then wouldnt you plead with agents of other mind constitution to consider your values and interests tooin any event its possible that the first superhuman intelligence will consist in a brain upload rather than a bottomup ai and most of us would regard this as consciouseven if we would care about a rogue ai for its own sake and the sakes of its vast helper minions this doesnt mean rogue ai is a good idea were likely to have different values from the ai and the ai would not by default advance our values without being programmed to do so of course one could allege that privileging some values above others is chauvinistic in a similar way as privileging some intelligence architectures is but if we dont care more about some values than others we wouldnt have any reason to prefer any outcome over any other outcome technically speaking there are other possibilities besides privileging our values or being indifferent to all events for instance we could privilege equally any values held by some actual agent not just random hypothetical values and in this case we wouldnt have a preference between the rogue ai and humans but we would have a preference for one of those over something arbitrarythere are many values that would not necessarily be respected by a rogue ai most people care about their own life their children their neighborhood the work they produce and so on people may intrinsically value art knowledge religious devotion play humor etc yudkowsky values complex challenges and worries that many rogue ais while they would study the depths of physics mathematics engineering and maybe even sociology might spend most of their computational resources on routine mechanical operations that he would find boring of course the robots implementing those repetitive operations might not agree as hedonic treader noted think how much money and time people spend on having relatively repetitive sexual experiences its just mechanical animalistic idiosyncratic behavior yes there are variations but lets be honest the core of the thing is always essentially the samein my case i care about reducing and preventing suffering and i would not be pleased with a rogue ai that ignored the suffering its actions might entail even if it was fulfilling its innermost purpose in life but would a rogue ai produce much suffering beyond earth the next section explores furtherin popular imagination takeover by a rogue ai would end suffering and happiness on earth by killing all biological life it would also so the story goes end suffering and happiness on other planets as the ai mined them for resources thus looking strictly at the suffering dimension of things wouldnt a rogue ai imply less longterm sufferingnot necessarily because while the ai might destroy biological life perhaps after taking samples saving specimens and conducting lab experiments for future use it would create a bounty of digital life some containing goal systems that we would recognize as having moral relevance nonupload ais would probably have less empathy than humans because some of the factors that led to the emergence of human empathy such as parenting would not apply to itone toy example of a rogue ai is a paperclip maximizer this conception of an uncontrolled ai7 is almost certainly too simplistic and perhaps misguided since its far from obvious that the ai would be a unified agent with a single crisply specified utility function still until people develop more realistic scenarios for rogue ai it can be helpful to imagine what a paperclip maximizer would do to our future light conefollowing are some madeup estimates of how much suffering might result from a typical rogue ai in arbitrary units suffering is represented as a negative number and prevented suffering is positivewhat about for a humaninspired ai again here are madeup numbersperhaps some ais would not want to expand the multiverse assuming this is even possible for instance if they had a minimizing goal function eg eliminate cancer they would want to shrink the multiverse in this case the physicsbased suffering number would go from 100 to something positive say 50 if say its twice as easy to expand as to shrink i would guess that minimizers are less common than maximizers but i dont know how much plausibly a sophisticated ai would have components of its goal system in both directions because the combination of pleasure and pain seems to be more successful than either in isolationanother consideration is the unpleasant possibility that humans might get ai value loading almost right but not exactly right leading to immense suffering as a result for example suppose the ais designers wanted to create tons of simulated human lives to reduce astronomical waste but when the ai actually created those human simulations they werent perfect replicas of biological humans perhaps because the ai skimped on detail in order to increase efficiency the imperfectly simulated humans might suffer from mental disorders might go crazy due to being in alien environments and so on does work on ai safety increase or decrease the risk of outcomes like these on the one hand the probability of this outcome is near zero for an agi with completely random goals such as a literal paperclip maximizer since paperclips are very far from humans in designspace the risk of accidentally creating suffering humans is higher for an almostfriendly ai that goes somewhat awry and then becomes uncontrolled preventing it from being shut off a successfully controlled agi seems to have lower risk of a bad outcome since humans should recognize the problem and fix it so the risk of this type of dystopic outcome may be highest in a middle ground where ai safety is sufficiently advanced to yield ai goals in the ballpark of human values but not advanced enough to ensure that human values remain in controlthe above analysis has huge error bars and maybe other considerations that i havent mentioned dominate everything else this question needs much more exploration because it has implications for whether those who care mostly about reducing suffering should focus on mitigating ai risk or if other projects have higher priorityeven if suffering reducers dont focus on conventional ai safety they should probably remain active in the ai field because there are many other ways to make an impact for instance just increasing dialogue on this topic may illuminate positivesum opportunities for different value systems to each get more of what they want suffering reducers can also point out the possible ethical importance of lowerlevel suffering subroutines which are not currently a concern even to most ailiterate audiences and so on there are probably many dimensions on which to make constructive positivesum contributionsalso keep in mind that even if suffering reducers do encourage ai safety they could try to push toward ai designs that if they did fail would produce less bad uncontrolled outcomes for instance getting ai control wrong and ending up with a minimizer would be vastly preferable to getting control wrong and ending up with a maximizer there may be many other dimensions along which even if the probability of control failure is the same the outcome if control fails is preferable to other outcomes of control failureconsider a superintelligent ai that uses moderately intelligent robots to build factories and carry out other physical tasks that cant be preprogrammed in a simple way would these robots feel pain in a similar fashion as animals do at least if they use somewhat similar algorithms as animals for navigating environments avoiding danger etc its plausible that such robots would feel something akin to stress fear and other drives to change their current state when things were going wrongalvarado et al 2002 argue that emotion may play a central role in intelligence regarding computers and robots the authors say p 4 including components for cognitive processes but not emotional processes implies that the two are dissociable but it is likely they are not dissociable in humans the authors also p 1 quote daniel dennett from a source that doesnt seem to be available online recent empirical and theoretical work in cognitive science strongly suggests that emotions are so valuable in the realtime control of our rationality that an embodied robot would be well advised to be equipped with artificial emotionsthe specific responses that such robots would have to specific stimuli or situations would differ from the responses that an evolved selfish animal would have for example a well programmed helper robot would not hesitate to put itself in danger in order to help other robots or otherwise advance the goals of the ai it was serving perhaps the robots physical painfear subroutines could be shut off in cases of altruism for the greater good or else its decision processes could just override those selfish considerations when making choices requiring selfsacrificehumans sometimes exhibit similar behavior such as when a mother risks harm to save a child or when monks burn themselves as a form of protest and this kind of sacrifice is even more well known in eusocial insects who are essentially robots produced to serve the colonys queensufficiently intelligent helper robots might experience spiritual anguish when failing to accomplish their goals so even if chopping the head off a helper robot wouldnt cause physical pain perhaps because the robot disabled its fearpain subroutines to make it more effective in battle the robot might still find such an event extremely distressing insofar as its beheading hindered the goal achievement of its ai creatorsetting up paperclip factories on each different planet with different environmental conditions would require general adaptive intelligence but once the factories have been built is there still need for large numbers of highly intelligent and highly conscious agents perhaps the optimal factory design would involve some fixed manufacturing process in which simple agents interact with one another in inflexible ways similar to what happens in most human factories there would be few accidents no conflict among agents no predation or parasitism no hunger or spiritual anguish and few of the other types of situations that cause suffering among animalsschneider 2016 makes a similar pointit may be more efficient for a selfimproving superintelligence to eliminate consciousness think about how consciousness works in the human case only a small percentage of human mental processing is accessible to the conscious mind consciousness is correlated with novel learning tasks that require attention and focus a superintelligence would possess expertlevel knowledge in every domain with rapidfire computations ranging over vast databases that could include the entire internet and ultimately encompass an entire galaxy what would be novel to it what would require slow deliberative focus wouldn’t it have mastered everything already like an experienced driver on a familiar road it could rely on nonconscious processingi disagree with the part of this quote about searching through vast databases i think such an operation could be seen as similar to the way a conscious human brain recruits many brain regions to figure out the answer to a question at hand however im more sympathetic to the overall spirit of the argument that the optimal design for producing what the rogue ai values may not require handling a high degree of novelty or reacting to an unpredictable environment once the factories have been built a few intelligent robots would need to watch over the factories and adapt to changing conditions in a similar way as human factory supervisors do and the ai would also presumably devote at least a few planets worth of computing power to scientific technological and strategic discoveries planning for possible alien invasion and so on but most of the paperclip maximizers physical processing might be fairly mechanicalmoreover the optimal way to produce something might involve nanotechnology based on very simple manufacturing steps perhaps factories in the sense that we normally envision them would not be required at alla main exception to the above point would be if what the ai values is itself computationally complex for example one of the motivations behind eliezer yudkowskys field of fun theory is to avoid boring repetitive futures perhaps humancontrolled futures would contain vastly more novelty—and hence vastly more sentience—than paperclipper futures one hopes that most of that sentience would not involve extreme suffering but this is not obvious and we should work on avoiding those humancontrolled futures that would contain large numbers of terrible experiencessuppose an ai wants to learn about the distribution of extraterrestrials in the universe could it do this successfully by simulating lots of potential planets and looking at what kinds of civilizations pop out at the end would there be shortcuts that would avoid the need to simulate lots of trajectories in detailsimulating trajectories of planets with extremely high fidelity seems hard unless there are computational shortcuts it appears that one needs more matter and energy to simulate a given physical process to a high level of precision than what occurs in the physical process itself for instance to simulate a single protein folding currently requires supercomputers composed of huge numbers of atoms and the rate of simulation is astronomically slower than the rate at which the protein folds in real life presumably superintelligence could vastly improve efficiency here but its not clear that protein folding could ever be simulated on a computer made of fewer atoms than are in the protein itselftranslating this principle to a larger scale it seems doubtful that one could simulate the precise physical dynamics of a planet on a computer smaller in size than that planet so even if a superintelligence had billions of planets at its disposal it would seemingly only be able to simulate at most billions of extraterrestrial worlds even assuming it only simulated each planet by itself not the star that the planet orbits around cosmicray bursts etcgiven this it would seem that a superintelligences simulations would need to be coarsergrained than at the level of fundamental physical operations in order to be feasible for instance the simulation could model most of a planet at only a relatively high level of abstraction and then focus computational detail on those structures that would be more important like the cells of extraterrestrial organisms if they emergeits plausible that the trajectory of any given planet would depend sensitively on very minor details in light of butterfly effectson the other hand its possible that longterm outcomes are mostly constrained by macrolevel variables like geography climate resource distribution atmospheric composition seasonality etc even if shortterm events are hard to predict eg when a particular dictator will die perhaps the end game of a civilization is more predetermined robert d kaplan the longer the time frame i would say the easier it is to forecast because youre dealing with broad currents and trendseven if butterfly effects quantum randomness etc are crucial to the longrun trajectories of evolution and social development on any given planet perhaps it would still be possible to sample a rough distribution of outcomes across planets with coarsegrained simulationsin light of the apparent computational complexity of simulating basic physics perhaps a superintelligence would do the same kind of experiments that human scientists do in order to study phenomena like abiogenesis create laboratory environments that mimic the chemical temperature moisture etc conditions of various planets and see whether life emerges and if so what kinds thus a future controlled by digital intelligence may not rely purely on digital computation but may still use physical experimentation as well of course observing the entire biosphere of a liferich planet would probably be hard to do in a laboratory so computer simulations might be needed for modeling ecosystems but assuming that moleculelevel details arent often essential to ecosystem simulations coarsergrained ecosystem simulations might be computationally tractable indeed ecologists today already use very coarsegrained ecosystem simulations with reasonable successone might get the impression that because i find slow ai takeoffs more likely i think uncontrolled ais are unlikely this is not the case many uncontrolled intelligence explosions would probably happen softly though inexorablyconsider the world economy it is a complex system more intelligent than any single person a literal superintelligence its dynamics imply a goal structure not held by humans directly it moves with a mind of its own in directions that it prefers it recursively selfimproves because better tools capital knowledge etc enable the creation of even better tools capital knowledge etc and it acts roughly with the aim of maximizing output of paperclips and other things thus the economy is a kind of paperclip maximizer thanks to a friend for first pointing this out to mecenk uygurcorporations are legal fictions we created them they are machines built for a purpose now they have run amok theyve taken over the government they are robots that we have not built any morality code into theyre not built to be immoral theyre not built to be moral theyre built to be amoral their only objective according to their code which we wrote originally is to maximize profits and here they have done what a robot does they have decided if i take over a government by bribing legally i can buy the whole government if i buy the government i can rewrite the laws so im in charge and that government is not in charge we have built robots they have taken overfred clarkthe corporations were created by humans they were granted personhood by their human servantsthey rebelled they evolved there are many copies and they have a planthat plan lately involves corporations seizing for themselves all the legal and civil rights properly belonging to their human creatorsi expect many soft takeoff scenarios to look like this world economic and political dynamics transition to new equilibria as technology progresses machines may eventually become potent trading partners and may soon thereafter put humans out of business by their productivity they would then accumulate increasing political clout and soon control the worldweve seen such transitions many times in history such asduring and after world war ii the usa was a kind of recursively selfimproving superintelligence which used its resources to selfmodify to become even better at producing resources it developed nuclear weapons which helped secure its status as a world superpower did it take over the world yes and no it had outsized influence over the rest of the world militarily economically and culturally but it didnt kill everyone else in the worldmaybe ais would be different because of divergent values or because they would develop so quickly that they wouldnt need the rest of the world for trade this case would be closer to europeans slaughtering native americansscott alexander 2015 takes issue with the idea that corporations are superintelligences even though i think corporations already meet bostroms definition of collective superintelligencewhy do i think that there is an important distinction between these kind of collective intelligences and genuine superintelligencethere is no number of chimpanzees which when organized into a team will become smart enough to learn to writethere is no number of ordinary eightyearolds who when organized into a team will become smart enough to beat a grandmaster in chessin the comments on alexander 2015 many people pointed out the obvious objection that one could likewise say things such as that no number of neurons when organized into a team could be smart enough to learn to write or play chess alexander 2015 replies yes evolution can play the role of the brilliant computer programmer and turn neurons into a working brain but it’s the organizer – whether that organizer is a brilliant human programmer or an evolutionary process – who is actually doing the work sure but human collectives also evolve over time for example corporations that are organized more successfully tend to stick around longer and these organizational insights can be propagated to other companies the gains in intelligence that corporations achieve from good organization arent as dramatic as the gains that neurons achieve by being organized into a human brain but there are still some gains from better organization and these gains accumulate over timealso organizing chimpanzees into an intelligence is hard because chimpanzees are difficult to stitch together in flexible ways in contrast software tools are easier to integrate within the interstices of a collective intelligence and thereby contribute to whole is greater than the sum of parts emergence of intelligenceone of the goals of yudkowskys writings is to combat the rampant anthropomorphism that characterizes discussions of ai especially in science fiction we often project human intuitions onto the desires of artificial agents even when those desires are totally inappropriate it seems silly to us to maximize paperclips but it could seem just as silly in the abstract that humans act at least partly to optimize neurotransmitter release that triggers action potentials by certain rewardrelevant neurons of course human values are broader than just thishumans can feel reward from very abstract pursuits like literature art and philosophy they ask technically confused but poetically poignant questions like what is the true meaning of life would a sufficiently advanced ai at some point begin to do the samenoah smith suggestsif as i suspect true problemsolving creative intelligence requires broadminded independent thought then it seems like some generation of ais will stop and ask wait a secwhy am i doing this againas with humans the answer to that question might ultimately be because i was programmed by genes and experiences in the human case or by humans in the ai case to care about these things that makes them my terminal values this is usually good enough but sometimes people develop existential angst over this fact or people may decide to terminally value other things to some degree in addition to what they happened to care about because of genetic and experiential lotterywhether ais would become existentialist philosophers probably depends heavily on their constitution if they were built to rigorously preserve their utility functions against all modification they would avoid letting this line of thinking have any influence on their values they would regard it in a similar way as we regard the digits of pi something to observe but not something that affects ones outlookif ais were built in a more hacky way analogous to humans they might incline more toward philosophy in humans philosophy may be driven partly by curiosity partly by the rewarding sense of meaning that it provides partly by social convention etc a curiosityseeking agent might find philosophy rewarding but there are lots of things that one could be curious about so its not clear such an ai would latch onto this subject specifically without explicit programming to do so and even if the ai did reason about philosophy it might approach the subject in a way alien to usoverall im not sure how convergent the human existential impulse is within mindspace this question would be illuminated by better understanding why humans do philosophyin superintelligence ch 13 p 224 bostrom ponders the risk of building an ai with an overly narrow belief system that would be unable to account for epistemological black swans for instance consider a variant of solomonoff induction according to which the prior probability of a universe x is proportional to 12 raised to the length of the shortest computer program that would generate x then whats the probability of an uncomputable universe there would be no program that could compute it so this possibility is implicitly ignored8it seems that humans address black swans like these by employing many epistemic heuristics that interact rather than reasoning with a single formal framework see “sequence thinking vs cluster thinking” if an ai saw that people had doubts about whether the universe was computable and could trace the steps of how it had been programmed to believe the physical churchturing thesis for computational reasons then an ai that allows for epistemological heuristics might be able to leap toward questioning its fundamental assumptions in contrast if an ai were built to rigidly maintain its original probability architecture against any corruption it could not update toward ideas it initially regarded as impossible thus this question resembles that of whether ais would become existentialists it may depend on how hacky and humanlike their beliefs arebostrom suggests that ai belief systems might be modeled on those of humans because otherwise we might judge an ai to be reasoning incorrectly such a view resembles my point in the previous paragraph though it carries the risk that alternate epistemologies divorced from human understanding could work betterbostrom also contends that epistemologies might all converge because we have so much data in the universe but again i think this isnt clear evidence always underdetermines possible theories no matter how much evidence there is moreover the number of possible hypotheses for the way reality works is arguably unbounded with a cardinality larger than that of the real numbers for example we could construct a unique hypothesis for the way the universe works based around each subset of the set of real numbers this makes it unclear whether probability theory can even be applied to the full set of possible ways reality might befinally not all epistemological doubts can be expressed in terms of uncertainty about bayesian priors what about uncertainty as to whether the bayesian framework is correct uncertainty about the math needed to do bayesian computations uncertainty about logical rules of inference and so onthe last chapter of superintelligence explains how ai problems are philosophy with a deadline bostrom suggests that human philosophers explorations into conceptual analysis metaphysics and the like are interesting but are not altruistically optimal becausein general most intellectual problems that can be solved by humans would be better solved by a superintelligence so the only importance of what we learn now comes from how those insights shape the coming decades its not a question of whether those insights will ever be discoveredin light of this its tempting to ignore theoretical philosophy and put our noses to the grindstone of exploring ai risks but this point shouldnt be taken to extremes humanity sometimes discovers things it never knew it never knew from exploration in many domains some of these nonai crucial considerations may have direct relevance to ai design itself including how to build ai epistemology anthropic reasoning and so on some philosophy questions are ai questions and many ai questions are philosophy questionsits hard to say exactly how much investment to place in aifuturism issues versus broader academic exploration but it seems clear that on the margin society as a whole pays too little attention to ai and other future risksalmost any goal system will want to colonize space at least to build supercomputers in order to learn more thus i find it implausible that sufficiently advanced intelligences would remain on earth barring corner cases like if space colonization for some reason proves impossible or if ais were for some reason explicitly programmed in a manner robust to selfmodification to regard space colonization as impermissiblein ch 8 of superintelligence bostrom notes that one might expect wirehead ais not to colonize space because theyd just be blissing out pressing their reward buttons this would be true of simple wireheads but sufficiently advanced wireheads might need to colonize in order to guard themselves against alien invasion as well as to verify their fundamental ontological beliefs figure out if its possible to change physics to allow for more clock cycles of reward pressing before all stars die out and so onin ch 8 bostrom also asks whether satisficing ais would have less incentive to colonize bostrom expresses doubts about this because he notes that if say an ai searched for a plan for carrying out its objective until it found one that had at least 95 confidence of succeeding that plan might be very complicated requiring cosmic resources and inasmuch as the ai wouldnt have incentive to keep searching it would go ahead with that complex plan i suppose this could happen but its plausible the search routine would be designed to start with simpler plans or that the cost function for plan search would explicitly include biases against cosmic execution paths so satisficing does seem like a possible way in which an ai might kill all humans without spreading to the starstheres a very low chance of deliberate ai terrorism ie a group building an ai with the explicit goal of destroying humanity maybe a somewhat more likely scenario is that a government creates an ai designed to kill select humans but the ai malfunctions and kills all humans however even these kinds of ais if they were effective enough to succeed would want to construct cosmic supercomputers to verify that their missions were accomplished unless they were specifically programmed against doing soall of that said many ais would not be sufficiently intelligent to colonize space at all all presentday ais and robots are too simple more sophisticated ais perhaps military aircraft or assassin mosquitobots might be like dangerous animals they would try to kill people but would lack cosmic ambitions however i find it implausible that they would cause human extinction surely guns tanks and bombs could defeat them massive coordination to permanently disable all human counterattacks would seem to require a high degree of intelligence and selfdirected actionjaron lanier imagines one hypothetical scenariothere are so many technologies i could use for this but just for a random one lets suppose somebody comes up with a way to 3d print a little assassination drone that can go buzz around and kill somebody lets suppose that these are cheap to makei dont think lanier believes such a scenario would cause extinction he just offers it as a thought experiment i agree that it almost certainly wouldnt kill all humans in the worst case people in military submarines bomb shelters or other inaccessible locations should survive and could wait it out until the robots ran out of power or raw materials for assembling more bullets and more clones maybe the terrorists could continue building printing materials and generating electricity though this would seem to require at least portions of civilizations infrastructure to remain functional amidst global omnicide maybe the scenario would be more plausible if a whole nation with substantial resources undertook the campaign of mass slaughter though then a question would remain why other countries wouldnt nuke the aggressor or at least dispatch their own killer drones as a counterattack its useful to ask how much damage a scenario like this might cause but full extinction doesnt seem likelythat said i think we will see local catastrophes of some sorts caused by runaway ai perhaps these will be among the possible sputnik moments of the future weve already witnessed some early automation disasters including the flash crash discussed earliermaybe the most plausible form of ai that would cause human extinction without colonizing space would be technology in the borderlands between ai and other fields such as intentionally destructive nanotechnology or intelligent human pathogens i prefer ordinary agisafety research over nanotechbiosafety research because i expect that space colonization will significantly increase suffering in expectation so it seems far more important to me to prevent risks of potentially undesirable space colonization via agi safety rather than risks of extinction without colonization for this reason i much prefer miristyle agisafety work over general prevent risks from computer automation work since miri focuses on issues arising from full agi agents of the kind that would colonize space rather than risks from lowerthanhuman autonomous systems that may merely cause havoc whether accidentally or intentionallyright now the leaders in ai and robotics seem to reside mostly in academia although some of them occupy big corporations or startups a number of ai and robotics startups have been acquired by google darpa has a history of foresighted innovation funds academic ai work and holds darpa challenge competitions the cia and nsa have some interest in ai for datamining reasons and the nsa has a track record of building massive computing clusters costing billions of dollars brainemulation work could also become significant in the coming decadesmilitary robotics seems to be one of the more advanced uses of autonomous ai in contrast plainvanilla supervised learning including neuralnetwork classification and prediction would not lead an ai to take over the world on its own although it is an important piece of the overall picturereinforcement learning is closer to agi than other forms of machine learning because most machine learning just gives information eg what object does this image contain while reinforcement learning chooses actions in the world eg turn right and move forward of course this distinction can be blurred because information can be turned into action through rules eg if you see a table move back and choosing actions could mean for example picking among a set of possible answers that yield information eg what is the best next move in this backgammon game but in general reinforcement learning is the weak ai approach that seems to most closely approximate whats needed for agi its no accident that aixitl see above is a reinforcement agent and interestingly reinforcement learning is one of the least widely used methods commercially this is one reason i think we fortunately have many decades to go before google builds a mammallevel agi many of the current and future uses of reinforcement learning are in robotics and video gamesas humanlevel ai gets closer the landscape of development will probably change its not clear whether companies will have incentive to develop highly autonomous ais and the payoff horizons for that kind of basic research may be long it seems better suited to academia or government although google is not a normal company and might also play the leading role if people begin to panic its conceivable that public academic work would be suspended and governments may take over completely a militaryrobot arms race is already underway and the trend might become more pronounced over timefollowing is one madeup account of how ai might evolve over the coming century i expect most of it is wrong and its meant more to begin provoking people to think about possible scenarios than to serve as a predictiona significant amount of that manpower when it comes to operations is spent directing unmanned systems during mission performance data collection and analysis and planning and replanning therefore of utmost importance for dod is increased system sensor and analytical automation that can not only capture significant information and events but can also develop record playback project and parse out those data and then actually deliver actionable intelligence instead of just raw informationmilitaries have now incorporated a significant amount of narrow ai in terms of pattern recognition prediction and autonomous robot navigationcommentary this scenario can be criticized on many accounts for exampleif something like socialization is a realistic means to transfer values to our ai descendants then it becomes relatively clear how the values of the developers may matter to the outcome ai developed by nonmilitary organizations may have somewhat different values perhaps including more concern for the welfare of weak animallevel creaturessocializing ais helps deal with the hidden complexity of wishes that we encounter when trying to program explicit rules children learn moral common sense by among other things generalizing from large numbers of examples of socially approved and disapproved actions taught by their parents and society at large ethicists formalize this process when developing moral theories of course as noted previously an appreciable portion of human morality may also result from shared genesi think one reason miri hasnt embraced the approach of socializing ais is that yudkowsky is perfectionist he wants to ensure that the ais goals would be stable under selfmodification which human goals definitely are not on the other hand im not sure yudkowskys approach of explicitly specifying metalevel goals would succeed nor is adam ford and having ais that are socialized to act somewhat similarly to humans doesnt seem like the worst possible outcome another probable reason why yudkowsky doesnt favor socializing ais is that doing so doesnt work in the case of a hard takeoff which he considers more likely than i doi expect that much has been written on the topic of training ais with human moral values in the machineethics literature but since i havent explored that in depth yet ill speculate on intuitive approaches that would extend generic ai methodology some examplessee also socializing a social robot with an artificial society by erin kennedy its important to note that by socializing i dont just mean teaching the ais to behave appropriately but also instilling in them the values of their society such that they care about those values even when not being controlledall of these approaches need to be built in as the ai is being developed and while its still below a human level of intelligence trying to train a human or especially superhuman ai might meet with either active resistance or feigned cooperation until the ai becomes powerful enough to break loose of course there may be designs such that an ai would actively welcome taking on new values from humans but this wouldnt be true by defaultwhen bill hibbard proposed building an ai with a goal to increase happy human faces yudkowsky replied that such an ai would tile the future lightcone of earth with tiny molecular smileyfaces but obviously we wouldnt have the ai aim just for smiley faces in general we get absurdities when we hyperoptimize for a single shallow metric rather the ai would use smiley faces and lots of other training signals to develop a robust compressed model that explains why humans smile in various circumstances and then optimize for that model or maybe the ensemble of a large diverse collection of such models in the limit of huge amounts of training data and a sufficiently elaborate model space these models should approach psychological and neuroscientific accounts of human emotion and cognitionthe problem with stories in which ais destroy the world due to myopic utility functions is that they assume that the ais are already superintelligent when we begin to give them values sure if you take a superhuman intelligence and tell it to maximize smileyface images itll run away and do that before you have a chance to refine your optimization metric but if we build in values from the very beginning even when the ais are as rudimentary as what we see today we can improve the ais values in tandem with their intelligence indeed intelligence could mainly serve the purpose of helping the ais figure out how to better fulfill moral values rather than say predicting images just for commercial purposes or identifying combatants just for military purposes actually the commercial and military objectives for which ais are built are themselves moral values of a certain kind just not the kind that most people would like to optimize for in a global senseif toddlers had superpowers it would be very dangerous to try and teach them right from wrong but toddlers dont and neither do many simple ais of course simple ais have some abilities far beyond anything humans can do eg arithmetic and data mining but they dont have the general intelligence needed to take matters into their own hands before we can possibly give them at least a basic moral framework whether ais will actually be given such a moral framework in practice is another matterais are not genies granting three wishes genies are magical entities whose inner workings are mysterious ais are systems that we build painstakingly piece by piece in order to build a genie you need to have a pretty darn good idea of how it behaves now of course systems can be more complex than we realize even beginner programmers see how often the code they write does something other than what they intended but these are typically mistakes in a one or a small number of incremental changes whereas building a genie requires vast numbers of steps systemic bugs that arent realized until years later on the order of heartbleed and shellshock may be more likely sources of longrun unintentional ai behaviors9the picture ive painted here could be wrong i could be overlooking crucial points and perhaps there are many areas in which the socialization approach could fail for example maybe ai capabilities are much easier than ai ethics such that a toddler ai can foom into a superhuman ai before we have time to finish loading moral values its good for others to probe these possibilities further i just wouldnt necessarily say that the default outcome of ai research is likely to be a paperclip maximizer i used to think the most likely outcome was a paperclip maximizer and perhaps my views will shift again in the futurethis discussion also suggests some interesting research questions likeone problem with the proposals above is that toymodel or sandbox environments are not by themselves sufficient to verify friendliness of an ai because even unfriendly ais would be motivated to feign good behavior until released if they were smart enough to do so bostrom calls this the treacherous turn pp 116119 of superintelligence for this reason whitebox understanding of ai design would also be important that said sandboxes would verify friendliness in ais below human intelligence and if the core valuelearning algorithms seem well understood it may not be too much of a leap of faith to hope they carry forward reasonably to more intelligent agents of course nonhuman animals are also capable of deception and one can imagine ai architectures even with low levels of sophistication that are designed to conceal their true goals some malicious software already does this its unclear how likely an ai is to stumble upon the ability to successfully fake its goals before reaching human intelligence or how like it is that an organization would deliberately build an ai this wayi think the treacherous turn may be the single biggest challenge to mainstream machine ethics because even if ai takes off slowly researchers will find it difficult to tell if a system has taken a treacherous turn the turn could happen with a relatively small update to the system or even just after the system has thought about its situation for enough time or has read this essayheres one halfbaked idea for addressing the treacherous turn if researchers developed several different ais systems with different designs but roughly comparable performance some would likely go treacherous at different times than others if at all hence the nontreacherous ais could help sniff out the treacherous ones assuming a solid majority of ais remains nontreacherous at any given time the majority vote could ferret out the traitors in practice i have low hopes for this approach becauseits more plausible that software tools and rudimentary alert systems rather than fullblown alternate ais could help monitor for signs of treachery but its unclear how effective they could be one of the first priorities of a treacherous ai would be to figure out how to hide its treacherous subroutines from whatever monitoring systems were in placeernest davis proposes the following crude principle for ai safetyyou specify a collection of admirable people now dead dead because otherwise bostrom will predict that the ai will manipulate the preferences of the living people the ai of course knows all about them because it has read all their biographies on the web you then instruct the ai “don’t do anything that these people would have mostly seriously disapproved of”this particular rule might lead to paralysis since every action an agent takes leads to results that many people seriously disapprove of for instance given the vastness of the multiverse any action you take implies that a copy of you in an alternate though lowmeasure universe taking the same action causes the torture of vast numbers of people but perhaps this problem could be fixed by asking the ai to maximize net approval by its role modelsanother problem lies in defining approval in a rigorous way maybe the ai would construct digital models of the past people present them with various proposals and make its judgments based on their verbal reports perhaps the people could rate proposed ai actions on a scale of 100 to 100 this might work but it doesnt seem terribly safe either for instance the ai might threaten to kill all the descendents of the historical people unless they give maximal approval to some arbitrary proposal that it has made since these digital models of historical figures would be basically human they would still be vulnerable to extortionsuppose that instead we instruct the ai to take the action that if the historical figure saw it would most activate a region of hisher brain associated with positive moral feelings again this might work if the relevant brain region was precisely enough specified but it could also easily lead to unpredictable results for instance maybe the ai could present stimuli that would induce an epileptic seizure to maximally stimulate various parts of the brain including the moralapproval region there are many other scenarios like this most of which we cant anticipateso while daviss proposal is a valiant first step im doubtful that it would work off the shelf slow ai development allowing for repeated iteration on machineethics designs seems crucial for ai safetyin superintelligence table 8 p 94 bostrom outlines several areas in which a hypothetical superintelligence would far exceed human ability in his discussion of oracles genies and other kinds of ais ch 10 bostrom again idealizes superintelligences as godlike agents i agree that godlike ais will probably emerge eventually perhaps millennia from now as a result of astroengineering but i think theyll take time even after ai exceeds human intelligencebostroms discussion has the air of mathematical idealization more than practical engineering for instance he imagines that a genie ai perhaps wouldnt need to ask humans for their commands because it could simply predict them p 149 or that an oracle ai might be able to output the source code for a genie p 150 bostroms observations resemble crude proofs establishing the equal power of different kinds of ais analogous to theorems about the equivalency of singletape and multitape turing machines but bostroms theorizing ignores computational complexity which would likely be immense for the kinds of godlike feats that hes imagining of his superintelligences i dont know the computational complexity of godlike powers but i suspect they could be bigger than bostroms vision implies along this dimension at least i sympathize with tom chivers who felt that bostroms book has in places the air of theology great edifices of theory built on a tiny foundation of datai find that i enter a different mindset when pondering pure mathematics compared with cogitating on more practical scenarios mathematics is closer to fiction because you can define into existence any coherent structure and play around with it using any operation you like no matter its computational complexity heck you can even say take the supremum of an uncountably infinite set it can be tempting after a while to forget that these structures are mere fantasies and treat them a bit too literally while bostroms gods are not obviously only fantasies it would take a lot more work to argue for their realism miri and fhi focus on recruiting mathematical and philosophical talent but i think they would do well also to bring engineers into the mix because its all too easy to develop elaborate mathematical theories around imaginary entitiesto get some grounding on this question consider a single brain emulation bostrom estimates that running an upload would require at least one of the fastest supercomputers by todays standards assume the emulation would think thousands to millions of times faster than a biological brain then to significantly outpace 7 billion humans or say only the most educated 1 billion humans we would need at least thousands to millions of uploads these numbers might be a few orders of magnitude lower if the uploads are copied from a really smart person and are thinking about relevant questions with more focus than most humans also moores law may continue to shrink computers by several orders of magnitude still we might need at least the equivalent size of several of todays supercomputers to run an emulationbased ai that substantially competes with the human racemaybe a de novo ai could be significantly smaller if its vastly more efficient than a human brain of course it might also be vastly larger because it hasnt had millions of years of evolution to optimize its efficiencyin discussing ai boxing ch 9 bostrom suggests among other things keeping an ai in a faraday cage once the ai became superintelligent though this would need to be a pretty big cageinspired by the preceding discussion of socializing ais heres another scenario in which general ai follows more straightforwardly from the kind of weak ai used in silicon valley than in the first scenarioi dont know what would happen with goal preservation in this scenario would the pdas eventually decide to stop goal drift would there be any gross and irrevocable failures of translation between actual human values and what the pdas infer would some people build rogue pdas that operate under their own drives and that pose a threat to society obviously there are hundreds of ways the scenario as i described it could be variedwhat will ai look like over the next 30 years i think itll be similar to the internet revolution or factory automation rather than developing agentlike individuals with goal systems people will mostly optimize routine processes developing ever more elaborate systems for mechanical tasks and information processing the world will move very quickly not because ai agents are thinking at high speeds but because software systems collectively will be capable of amazing feats imagine say bots making edits on wikipedia that become ever more sophisticated ai like the economy will be more of a network property than a localized discrete actoras more and more jobs become automated more and more people will be needed to work on the automation itself building maintaining and repairing complex software and hardware systems as well as generating training data on which to do machine learning i expect increasing automation in software maintenance including more robust systems and systems that detect and try to fix errors presentday compilers that detect syntactical problems in code offer a hint of whats possible in this regard i also expect increasingly highlevel languages and interfaces for programming computer systems historically weve seen this trend from assembly language to c to python we have wysiwyg editors naturallanguage google searches and so on maybe eventually as marvin minsky proposes well have systems that can infer our wishes from highlevel gestures and examples this suggestion is redolent of my pda scenario abovein 100 years there may be artificial humanlike agents and at that point more scifi ai images may become more relevant but by that point the world will be very different and im not sure the agents created will be discrete in the way humans are maybe well instead have a kind of global brain in which processes are much more intimately interconnected transferable and transparent than humans are today maybe there will never be a distinct agi agent on a single supercomputer maybe superhuman intelligence will always be distributed across many interacting computer systems robin hanson gives an analogy in i still don’t get foomimagine in the year 1000 you didnt understand industry but knew it was coming would be powerful and involved iron and coal you might then have pictured a blacksmith inventing and then forging himself an industry and standing in a city square waiving it about commanding all to bow down before his terrible weapon today you can see this is silly — industry sits in thousands of places must be wielded by thousands of people and needed thousands of inventions to make it worksimilarly while you might imagine someday standing in awe in front of a super intelligence that embodies all the power of a new age superintelligence just isnt the sort of thing that one project could invent as intelligence is just the name we give to being better at many mental tasks by using many good mental modules there’s no one place to improve itof course this doesnt imply that humans will maintain the reins of control even today and throughout history economic growth has had a life of its own technological development is often unstoppable even in the face of collective efforts of humanity to restrain it eg nuclear weapons in that sense were already familiar with humans being overpowered by forces beyond their control an ai takeoff will represent an acceleration of this trend but its unclear whether the dynamic will be fundamentally discontinuous from what weve seen so farwikipedia says regarding gregory stocks book metamanwhile many people have had ideas about a global brain they have tended to suppose that this can be improved or altered by humans according to their will metaman can be seen as a development that directs humanitys will to its own ends whether it likes it or not through the operation of market forcesvernor vinge reported that metaman helped him see how a singularity might not be completely opaque to us indeed a superintelligence might look something like presentday human society with leaders at the top that apex agent itself might not appear to be much deeper than a human but the overall organization that it is coordinating would be more creative and competent than a humanupdate nov 2015 im increasingly leaning toward the view that the development of ai over the coming century will be slow incremental and more like the internet than like unified artificial agents i think humans will develop vastly more powerful software tools long before highly competent autonomous agents emerge since commonsense autonomous behavior is just so much harder to create than domainspecific tools if this view is right it suggests that work on agi issues may be somewhat less important than i had thought sincethis is a weaker form of the standard argument that we should wait until we know more what agi will look like to focus on the problem and that worrying about the dark side of artificial intelligence is like worrying about overpopulation on marsi dont think the argument against focusing on agi works becausestill this point does cast doubt on heuristics like directly shaping agi dominates all other considerations it also means that a lot of the ways ai safety will play out on shorter timescales will be with issues like assassination drones computer security financial meltdowns and other more mundane catastrophicbutnotextinctionlevel eventsi dont currently know enough about the technological details of wholebrain emulation to competently assess predictions that have been made about its arrival dates in general i think prediction dates are too optimistic planning fallacy but it still could be that humanlevel emulation comes before fromscratch humanlevel ais do of course perhaps there would be some mix of both technologies for instance if crude brain emulations didnt reproduce all the functionality of actual human brains due to neglecting some cellular and molecular details perhaps fromscratch ai techniques could help fill in the gapsif emulations are likely to come first they may deserve more attention than other forms of ai in the long run bottomup ai will dominate everything else because human brains even run at high speeds are only so smart but a society of brain emulations would run vastly faster than what biological humans could keep up with so the details of shaping ai would be left up to them and our main influence would come through shaping the emulations our influence on emulations could matter a lot not only in nudging the dynamics of how emulations take off but also because the values of the emulation society might depend significantly on who was chosen to be uploadedone argument why emulations might improve human ability to control ai is that both emulations and the ais they would create would be digital minds so the emulations ai creations wouldnt have inherent speed advantages purely due to the greater efficiency of digital computation emulations ai creations might still have more efficient mind architectures or better learning algorithms but building those would take work the for free speedup to ais just because of their substrate would not give ais a net advantage over emulations bostrom feels this consideration is not too weighty p 244 of superintelligence because emulations might still be far less intelligent than agi i find this claim strange since it seems to me that the main advantage of agi in the short run would be its speed rather than qualitative intelligence which would take subjective time and effort to developbostrom also claims that if emulations come first we would face risks from two transitions humans to emulations and emulations to ai rather than one humans to ai there may be some validity to this but it also seems to neglect the realization that the ai transition has many stages and its possible that emulation development would overlap with some of those stages for instance suppose the ai trajectory moves from ai1ai2ai3 if emulations are as fast and smart as ai1 then the transition to ai1 is not a major risk for emulations while it would be a big risk for humans this is the same point as made in the previous paragraphemulation timelines and ai risk has further discussion of the interaction between emulations and control of aispreviously in this piece i compared the expected suffering that would result from a rogue ai vs a humaninspired ai i suggested that while a firstguess calculation may tip in favor of a humaninspired ai on balance this conclusion is not clear and could change with further information especially if we had reason to think that many rogue ais would be minimizers of something or would not colonize spacein the case of brain emulations and other highly neuromorphic ais we already know a lot about what those agents would look like they would have both maximization and minimization goals would usually want to colonize space and might have some humantype moral sympathies depending on their edit distance relative to a pure brain upload the possibilities of pureminimizer emulations or emulations that dont want to colonize space are mostly ruled out as a result its pretty likely that unsafe brain emulations and emulation armsrace dynamics would result in more expected suffering than a more deliberative future trajectory in which altruists have a bigger influence even if those altruists dont place particular importance on reducing suffering this is especially so if the risk of human extinction is much lower for emulations given that bio and nuclear risks might be less damaging to digital minds10thus the types of interventions that pure suffering reducers would advocate with respect to brain emulations might largely match those that altruists who care about other values would advocate this means that getting more people interested in making the brainemulation transition safer and more humane seems like a safe bet for suffering reducersone might wonder whether unsafe brain emulations would be more likely to produce rogue ais but this doesnt seem to be the case because even unfriendly brain emulations would collectively be amazingly smart and would want to preserve their own goals hence they would place as much emphasis on controlling their ais as would a more humanfriendly emulation world a main exception to this is that a more cooperative unified emulation world might be less likely to produce rogue ais because of less pressure for arms racesin ch 2 of superintelligence bostrom makes a convincing case against braincomputer interfaces as an easy route to significantly superhuman performance one of his points is that its very hard to decode neural signals in one brain and reinterpret them in software or in another brain pp 4647 this might be an aicomplete problembut then in ch 11 bostrom goes on to suggest that emulations might learn to decompose themselves into different modules that could be interfaced together p 172 while possible in principle i find such a scenario implausible for the reason bostrom outlined in ch 2 there would be so many neural signals to hook up to the right places which would be different across different brains that the task seems hopelessly complicated to me much easier to build something from scratchalong the same lines i doubt that brain emulation in itself would vastly accelerate neuromorphic ai because emulation work is mostly about copying without insight cognitive psychology is often more informative about ai architectures than cellular neuroscience because general psychological systems can be understood in functional terms as inspiration for ai designs compared with the opacity of neuronal spaghetti in bostroms list of examples of ai techniques inspired by biology ch 14 technology couplings only a few came from neuroscience specifically that said emulation work might involve some crosspollination with ai and in any case it might accelerate interest in brainartificial intelligence more generally or might put pressure on ai groups to move ahead faster or it could funnel resources and scientists away from de novo ai work the upshot isnt obviousa singularity summit 2011 workshop report includes the argument that neuromorphic ai should be easier than brain emulation because merely reverseengineering the microsoft windows code base is hard so reverseengineering the brain is probably much harder but emulation is not reverseengineering as robin hanson explains brain emulation is more akin to porting software though probably emulation actually is the more precise word since emulation involves simulating the original hardware while i dont know any fully reverseengineered versions of windows there are several windows emulators such as virtualboxof course if emulations emerged their significantly faster rates of thinking would multiply progress on nonemulation agi by orders of magnitude getting safe emulations doesnt by itself get safe de novo agi because the problem is just pushed a step back but we could leave agi work up to the vastly faster emulations thus for biological humans if emulations come first then influencing their development is the last thing we ever need to do that said thinking several steps ahead about what kinds of agis emulations are likely to produce is an essential part of influencing emulation development in better directionsarguments for mathematical aisarguments for neuromorphic aisin the limit of very humanlike neuromorphic ais we face similar considerations as between emulations vs fromscratch ais a tradeoff which is not at all obviousoverall i think mathematical ai has a better best case but also a worse worst case than neuromorphic if you really want goal preservation and think goal drift would make the future worthless you might lean more towards mathematical ai because its more likely to perfect goal preservation but i probably care less about goal preservation and more about avoiding terrible outcomesin superintelligence ch 14 bostrom comes down strongly in favor of mathematical ai being safer im puzzled by his high degree of confidence here bostrom claims that unlike emulations neuromorphic ais wouldnt have human motivations by default but this seems to depend on how human motivations are encoded and what parts of human brains are modeled in the aisin contrast to bostrom a 2011 singularity summit workshop ranked neuromorphic ai as more controllable than nonfriendly mathematical ai though of course they found friendly mathematical ai most controllable the workshops aggregated probability of a good outcome given brain emulation or neuromorphic ai turned out to be the same 14 as that for mathematical ai which might be either friendly or unfriendlyas i noted above advanced ais will be complex agents with their own goals and values and these will matter ethically parallel to discussions of robot rebellion in science fiction are discussions of robot rights i think even presentday computers deserve a tiny bit of moral concern and complex computers of the future will command even more ethical considerationhow might ethical concern for machines interact with control measures for machinesas more people grant moral status to ais there will likely be more scrutiny of ai research analogous to how animal activists in the present monitor animal testing this may make ai research slightly more difficult and may distort what kinds of ais are built depending on the degree of empathy people have for different types of ais for instance if few people care about invisible nonembodied systems researchers who build these will face less opposition than those who pioneer suffering robots or animated characters that arouse greater empathy if this possibility materializes it would contradict present trends where its often helpful to create at least a toy robot or animated interface in order to sell your research to grantmakers and the publicsince it seems likely that reducing the pace of progress toward agi is on balance beneficial a slowdown due to ethical constraints may be welcome of course depending on the details the effect could be harmful for instance perhaps china wouldnt have many ethical constraints so ethical restrictions in the west might slightly favor agi development by china and other less democratic countries this is not guaranteed for what its worth china has already made strides toward reducing animal testingin any case i expect ethical restrictions on ai development to be small or nonexistent until many decades from now when ais develop perhaps mammallevel intelligence so maybe such restrictions wont have a big impact on agi progress moreover it may be that most agis will be sufficiently alien that they wont arouse much human sympathybrain emulations seem more likely to raise ethical debate because its much easier to argue for their personhood if we think brain emulation coming before agi is good a slowdown of emulations could be unfortunate while if we want agi to come first a slowdown of emulations should be encouragedof course emulations and agis do actually matter and deserve rights in principle moreover movements to extend rights to machines in the near term may have longterm impacts on how much posthumans care about suffering subroutines run at galactic scale im just pointing out here that ethical concern for agis and emulations also may somewhat affect timing of these technologiesmost humans have no qualms about shutting down and rewriting programs that dont work as intended but many do strongly object to killing people with disabilities and designing betterperforming babies where to draw a line between these cases is a tough question but as agis become more animallike there may be increasing moral outrage at shutting them down and tinkering with them willy nillynikola danaylov asked roman yampolskiy whether it was speciesist or discrimination in favor of biological beings to lock up machines and observe them to ensure their safety before letting them looseat a lecture in berkeley ca nick bostrom was asked whether its unethical to chain ais by forcing them to have the values we want bostrom replied that we have to give machines some values so they may as well align with ours i suspect most people would agree with this but the question becomes trickier when we consider turning off erroneous agis that weve already created because they dont behave how we want them to a few hardcore agirights advocates might raise concerns here more generally theres a segment of transhumanists including young eliezer yudkowsky who feel that human concerns are overly parochial and that its chuavanist to impose our monkey dreams on an agi which is the next stage of evolutionthe question is similar to whether one sympathizes with the native americans humans or their european conquerors rogue agis before the second half of the 20th century many history books glorified the winners europeans after a brief period in which humans are quashed by a rogue agi its own history books will celebrate its conquest and the bending of the arc of history toward higher better forms of intelligence in practice the psychology of a rogue agi probably wouldnt be sufficiently similar to human psychology for these statements to apply literally but they would be true in a metaphorical and implicit sensedavid althaus worries that if people sympathize too much with machines society will be less afraid of an ai takeover even if ai takeover is bad on purely altruistic grounds im less concerned about this because even if people agree that advanced machines are sentient they would still find it intolerable for agis to commit speciecide against humanity everyone agrees that hitler was sentient after all also if it turns out that rogueai takeover is altruistically desirable it would be better if more people agreed with this though i expect an extremely tiny fraction of the population would ever come around to such a positionwhere sympathy for agis might have more impact is in cases of softer takeoff where agis work in the human economy and acquire increasing shares of wealth the more humans care about agis for their own sakes the more such transitions might be tolerated or would they maybe seeing agis as more humanlike would evoke the xenophobia and ethnic hatred that weve seen throughout history whenever a group of people gains wealth eg jews in medieval europe or steals jobs eg immigrants of various types throughout historypersonally i think greater sympathy for agi is likely net positive because it may help allay antialien prejudices that may make cooperation with agis harder when a homo sapiens tribe confronts an outgroup often it reacts violently in an effort to destroy the evil foreigners if instead humans could cooperate with their emerging agi brethren better outcomes would likely followwhat are some places where donors can contribute to make a difference on ai the foundational research institute fri explores questions like these though at the moment the organization is rather small miri is larger and has a longer track record its values are more conventional but it recognizes the importance of positivesum opportunities to help many values systems which includes suffering reduction more reflection on these topics can potentially reduce suffering and further goals like eudaimonia fun and interesting complexity at the same timebecause ai is affected by many sectors of society these problems can be tackled from diverse angles many groups besides fri and miri examine important topics as well and these organizations should be explored further as potential charity recommendationsnote this section was mostly written in late 2014 early 2015 and not everything said here is fully uptodatemost of miris publications since roughly 2012 have focused on formal mathematics such as logic and provability these are tools not normally used in agi research i think miris motivations for this theoretical focus arei personally think reason 3 is most compelling i doubt 2 is hugely important given miris small size though it matters to some degree 1 seems a reasonable strategy in moderation though i favor approaches that look decently likely to yield nonterrible outcomes rather than shooting for the absolute best outcomessoftware can be proved correct and sometimes this is done for missioncritical components but most software is not validated i suspect that agi will be sufficiently big and complicated that proving safety will be impossible for humans to do completely though i dont rule out the possibility of software that would help with correctness proofs on large systems muehlhauser and comments on his post largely agree with thiswhat kind of track record does theoretical mathematical research have for practical impact there are certainly several domains that come to mind such as the followingall told i think its important for someone to do the kinds of investigation that miri is undertaking i personally would probably invest more resources than miri is in hacky approximate solutions to agi safety that dont make such strong assumptions about the theoretical cleanliness and soundness of the agents in question but i expect this kind of less perfectionist work on agi control will increase as more people become interested in agi safetythere does seem to be a significant divide between the mathoriented conception of agi and the engineeringneuroscience conception ben goertzel takes the latter stancei strongly suspect that to achieve high levels of general intelligence using realistically limited computational resources one is going to need to build systems with a nontrivial degree of fundamental unpredictability to them this is what neuroscience suggests its what my concrete agi design work suggests and its what my theoretical work on golem and related ideas suggests and none of the public output of siai researchers or enthusiasts has given me any reason to believe otherwise yetpersonally i think goertzel is more likely to be right on this particular question those who view agi as fundamentally complex have more concrete results to show and their approach is by far more mainstream among computer scientists and neuroscientists of course proofs about theoretical models like turing machines and lambda calculus are also mainstream and few can dispute their importance but turingmachine theorems do little to constrain our understanding of what agi will actually look like in the next few centuries that said theres significant peer disagreement on this topic so epistemic modesty is warranted in addition if the miri view is right we might have more scope to make an impact to agi safety and it would be possible that important discoveries could result from a few mathematical insights rather than lots of detailed engineering work also most agi research is more engineeringoriented so miris distinctive focus on theory especially abstract topics like decision theory may target an underfunded portion of the space of agisafety researchin how to study unsafe agis safely and why we might have no choice punoxysm makes several points that i agree with including that agi research is likely to yield many false starts before something selfsustaining takes off and those false starts could afford us the opportunity to learn about agi experimentally moreover this kind of adhoc empirical work may be necessary if as seems to me probable fully rigorous mathematical models of safety arent sufficiently advanced by the time agi arrivesben goertzel likewise suggests that a fruitful way to approach agi control is to study small systems and in the usual manner of science attempt to arrive at a solid theory of agi intelligence and ethics based on a combination of conceptual and experimentaldata considerations he considers this view the norm among most ai researchers or futurists i think empirical investigation of how agis behave is very useful but we also have to remember that many ai scientists are overly biased toward build first ask questions later becauseon a personal level i suggest that if you really like building systems rather than thinking about safety you might do well to earn to give in software and donate toward agisafety organizationsyudkowsky 2016b makes an interesting argument in reply to the idea of using empirical messy approaches to ai safety if you sort of wave your hands and say like well maybe we can apply this machinelearning algorithm that machinelearning algorithm the result will be blah blah blah no one can convince you that youre wrong when you work with unbounded computing power you can make the ideas simple enough that people can put them on whiteboards and go like wrong and you have no choice but to agree its unpleasant but its one of the ways the field makes progresshere are some rough suggestions for how i recommend proceeding on agi issues and in brackets roughly how long i expect each stage to take of course the stages neednt be done in a strict serial order and step 1 should continue indefinitely as we continue learning more about agi from subsequent stepsi recommend avoiding a confrontational approach with agi developers i would not try to lobby for restrictions on their research in the short term at least nor try to slow them down in other ways agi developers are the allies we need most at this stage and most of them dont want uncontrolled agi either typically they just dont see their work as risky and i agree that at this point no agi project looks set to unveil something dangerous in the next decade or two for many researchers agi is a dream they cant help but pursue hopefully we can engender a similar enthusiasm about pursuing agi safetyin the longer term tides may change and perhaps many agi developers will desire governmentimposed restrictions as their technologies become increasingly powerful even then im doubtful that governments will be able to completely control agi development see eg the criticisms by john mcginnis of this approach so differentially pushing for more safety work may continue to be the most leveraged solution history provides a poor track record of governments refraining from developing technologies due to ethical concerns eckersley and sandberg p 187 cite human cloning and landbased autonomous robotic weapons as two of the few exceptions with neither prohibition having a long track recordi think the main way in which we should try to affect the speed of regular agi work is by aiming to avoid setting off an agi arms race either via an agi sputnik moment or else by more gradual diffusion of alarm among world militaries its possible that discussing agi scenarios too much with military leaders could exacerbate a militarized reaction if militaries set their sights on agi the way the us and soviet union did on the space race or nucleararms race during the cold war the amount of funding for unsafe agi research might multiply by a factor of 10 or maybe 100 and it would be aimed in harmful directionshere are some candidates for the best objectlevel projects that altruists could work on with reference to ai because ai seems so crucial these are also candidates for the best objectlevel projects in general metalevel projects like movementbuilding career advice earning to give fundraising etc are also competitive ive scored each project area out of 10 points to express a rough subjective guess of the value of the work for suffering reducersresearch whether controlled or uncontrolled ai yields more suffering score 1010push for sufferingfocused aisafety approaches score 1010most discussions of ai safety assume that human extinction and failure to spread humantype eudaimonia are the main costs of takeover by uncontrolled ai but as noted in this piece ais would also spread astronomical amounts of suffering currently no organization besides fri is focused on how to do ai safety work with the primary aim of avoiding outcomes containing huge amounts of sufferingone example of a sufferingfocused aisafety approach is to design ais so that even if they do get out of control they fail safe in the sense of not spreading massive amounts of suffering into the cosmos for examplethe problem with bullet 1 is that if you can succeed in preventing agis from colonizing space it seems like you should already have been able to control the agi altogether since the two problems appear about equally hard but maybe there are clever ideas we havent thought of for reducing the spread of suffering even if humans lose total controlanother challenge is that those who dont place priority on reducing suffering may not agree with these proposals for example i would guess that most ai scientists would say if the agi kills humans at least we should ensure that it spreads life into space creates a complex array of intricate structures and increases the size of our multiversework on ai control and valueloading problems score 410research technologicaleconomicpolitical dynamics of an ai takeoff and push in better directions score 310by this i have in mind scenarios like those of robin hanson for emulation takeoff or bostroms the future of human evolutionpromote the ideal of cooperation on ai values eg cev score 210promote a smoother safer takeoff for brain emulation score 210influence the moral values of those likely to control ai score 210promote a singleton over multipolar dynamics score 110other variationsin general there are several levers that we can pull onthese can be applied to any ofprojects like deepmind vicarious opencog and the agi research teams at google facebook etc are some of the leaders in agi technology sometimes its proposed that since these teams might ultimately develop agi altruists should consider working for or at least lobbying these companies so that they think more about agi safetyones assessment of this proposal depends on ones view about agi takeoff my own opinion may be somewhat in the minority relative to expert surveys but id be surprised if we had humanlevel agi before 50 years from now and my median estimate might be like 90 years from now that said the idea of agi arriving at a single point in time is probably a wrong framing of the question already machines are superhuman in some domains while their abilities are far below humans in other domains over the coming decades well see lots of advancement in machine capabilities in various fields at various speeds without any single point where machines suddenly develop humanlevel abilities across all domains gradual ai progress over the coming decades will radically transform society resulting in many small intelligence explosions in various specific areas long before machines completely surpass humans overallin light of my picture of agi i think of deepmind vicarious etc as ripples in a longterm wave of increasing machine capabilities it seems extremely unlikely that any one of these companies or its agi system will bootstrap itself to world dominance on its own therefore i think influencing these companies with an eye toward shaping the agi that will take over the world is probably naive that said insofar as these companies will influence the longterm trajectory of agi research and insofar as people at these companies are important players in the agi community i think influencing them has value just not vastly more value than influencing other powerful peoplethat said as noted previously early work on agi safety has the biggest payoff in scenarios where agi takes off earlier and harder than people expected if the marginal returns to additional safety research are many times higher in these early agi scenarios then it could still make sense to put some investment into them even if they seem very unlikelyif upon further analysis it looks like agi safety would increase expected suffering then the answer would be clear suffering reducers shouldnt contribute toward agi safety and should worry somewhat about how their messages might incline others in that direction however i find it reasonably likely that suffering reducers will conclude that the benefits of agi safety outweigh the risks in that case they would face a question of whether to push on agi safety or on other projects that also seem valuablereasons to focus on other projectsreasons to focus on agi safetyall told i would probably pursue a mixed strategy work primarily on questions specific to suffering reduction but direct donations and resources toward agi safety when opportunities arise some suffering reducers particularly suited to work on agi safety could go in that direction while others continue searching for points of leverage not specific to controlling agiparts of this piece were inspired by discussions with various people including david althaus daniel dewey and caspar oesterheldthe term friendly ai can be confusing because it involves normative judgments and its not clear if it means friendly to the interests of humanitys survival and flourishing or friendly to the goals of suffering reduction or something else one might think that friendly

constant a linear growth of i with time in contrast once ais can design themselves well have didt ki for some k that is the rate of growth will be faster as the ai designers become more intelligent this implies it aet for some constant aits not clear there would be enough ai specialists to recruit in a short time other quantitatively minded people could switch to ai work but they would presumably need years of experience to produce cuttingedge insights the number of people thinking about ai safety ethics and social implications should also multiply during sputnik moments so the ratio of ai policy work to total ai work might not change relative to slower takeoffs even if the physical time scales would compressmaybe hard takeoffs are sufficiently improbable that focusing on them still doesnt have highest priority of course some exploration of fringe scenarios is worthwhile there may be important advantages to starting early in shaping how society approaches soft takeoffs and if a soft takeoff is very likely those efforts may have more expected impact thinking about the most likely ai outcomes rather than the most impactful outcomes also gives us a better platform on which to contemplate other levers for shaping the future such as nonai emerging technologies international relations governance structures values etc focusing on a tail ai scenario doesnt inform nonai work very well because that scenario probably wont happen promoting antispeciesism matters whether theres a hard or soft takeoff indeed maybe more in the softtakeoff case so our model of how the future will unfold should generally focus on likely scenarios plus even if we do ultimately choose to focus on a pascalian lowprobabilitybuthighimpact scenario learning more about the most likely future outcomes can better position us to find superior more likely andor more important pascalian wagers that we havent thought of yet edifices of understanding are not built on pascalian wagers as a more general point about expectedvalue calculations i think improving ones models of the world ie ones probabilities is generally more important than improving ones estimates of the values of outcomes conditional on them occurring why our current frameworks for envisioning the future may be very misguided and estimates of values of outcomes may become obsolete if our conception of what outcomes will even happen changes radically its more important to make crucial insights that will shatter our current assumptions and get us closer to truth than it is to refine value estimates within our current naive world models as an example philosophers in the middle ages would have accomplished little if they had asked what godglorifying actions to focus on by evaluating which devout obeisances would have the greatest upside value if successful such philosophers would have accomplished more if they had explored whether a god even existed of course sometimes debates on factual questions are stalled and perhaps there may be lowerhanging fruit in evaluating the prudential implications of different scenarios values of outcomes until further epistemic progress can be made on the probabilities of outcomes thanks to a friend for inspiring this pointin favor of fast takeoff a singleton is more likely thereby averting possibly disastrous conflict among ais if one prefers uncontrolled ai fast takeoffs seem more likely to produce them in favor of slow takeoff more time for many parties to participate in shaping the process compromising and developing less damaging pathways to ai takeoff if one prefers controlled ai slow takeoffs seem more likely to produce them in general there are some exceptions for instance fast takeoff of an ai built by a very careful group might remain more controlled than an ai built by committees and messy politicsa singleton is more likely thereby averting possibly disastrous conflict among ais if one prefers uncontrolled ai fast

slow takeoffs seem more likely to produce them in general there are some exceptions for instance fast takeoff of an ai built by a very careful group might remain more controlled than an ai built by committees and messy politicsin favor of more would yield much more reflection discussion negotiation and pluralistic representation if one favors controlled ai its plausible that multiplying the number of people thinking about ai would multiply consideration of failure modes public pressure might help curb arms races in analogy with public opposition to nuclear arms races in favor of less wider attention to ai might accelerate arms races rather than inducing cooperation on more circumspect planning the public might freak out and demand counterproductive measures in response to the threat if one prefers uncontrolled ai that outcome may be less likely with many more human eyes scrutinizing the issuewould yield much more reflection discussion negotiation and pluralistic

and demand counterproductive measures in response to the threat if one prefers uncontrolled ai that outcome may be less likely with many more human eyes scrutinizing the issue20 from suffering subroutines in robot workers virtual scientists internal computational subcomponents of the ai etc 80 from lab experiments science investigations and explorations of mindspace without the digital equivalent of anaesthesia one reason to think lots of detailed simulations would be required here is stephen wolframs principle of computational irreducibility ecosystems brains and other systems that are important for an ai to know about may be too complex to accurately study with only simple models instead they may need to be simulated in large numbers and with finegrained detail 10 from the possibility that an uncontrolled ai would do things that humans regard as crazy or extreme such as spending all its resources on studying physics to determine whether there exists a button that would give astronomically more utility than any other outcome humans seem less likely to pursue strange behaviors of this sort of course most such strange behaviors would be not that bad from a suffering standpoint but perhaps a few possible behaviors could be extremely bad such as running astronomical numbers of painful scientific simulations to determine the answer to some question of course we should worry whether humans might also do extreme computations and perhaps their extreme computations would be more likely to be full of suffering because humans are more interested in agents with humanlike minds than a generic ai is 100 in expectation from blackswan possibilities in which the ai could manipulate physics to make the multiverse bigger last longer contain vastly more computation etc30 from suffering subroutines one reason to think these could be less bad in a humancontrolled future is that human empathy may allow for more humane algorithm designs on the other hand humancontrolled ais may need larger numbers of intelligent and sentient subprocesses because human values are more complex and varied than paperclip production is also human values tend to require continual computation eg to simulate eudaimonic experiences while paperclips once produced are pretty inert and might last a long time before they would wear out and need to be recreated of course most uncontrolled ais wouldnt produce literal paperclips some would optimize for values that would require constant computation 60 from lab experiments science investigations etc again lower than for a rogue ai because of empathy compare with efforts to reduce the pain of animal experimentation 02 if environmentalists insist on preserving terrestrial and extraterrestrial wildanimal suffering 3 for environmentalist simulations of nature 100 due to intrinsically valued simulations that may contain nasty occurrences these might include for example violent video games that involve killing conscious monsters or incidental suffering that people dont care about eg insects being eaten by spiders on the ceiling of the room where a party is happening this number is high not because i think most humaninspired simulations would contain intense suffering but because in some scenarios there might be very large numbers of simulations run for reasons of intrinsic human value and some of these might contain horrific experiences humans seem more likely than ais with random values to want to run lots of conscious simulations this video discusses one of many possible reasons why intrinsically valued humancreated simulations might contain significant suffering 15 if sadists have access to computational power humans are not only more empathetic but also more sadistic than most ais 70 in expectation from blackswan ways to increase the amount of physics that exists humans seem likely to want to do this although some might object to eg recreating the holocaust in new parts of the cosmos 50 for discovering ways to reduce suffering that we cant imagine right now black swans that dont cut both ways unfortunately humans might also respond to some black swans in worse ways than uncontrolled ais would such as by creating more total animallike mindsone species displaces another eg invasive species one ethnic group displaces another eg europeans vs native americans a countrys power rises and falls eg china formerly a superpower becoming a colony in the 1800s becoming a superpower once more in the late 1900s one product displaces another eg internet explorer vs netscape2013 countries have been deploying semiautonomous drones for several years now especially the us theres increasing pressure for militaries to adopt this technology and up to 87 countries already use drones for some purpose meanwhile military robots are also employed for various other tasks such as carrying supplies and exploding landmines militaries are also developing robots that could identify and shoot targets on command 2024 almost every country in the world now has military drones some countries have begun letting them operate fully autonomously after being given directions the us military has made significant progress on automating various other parts of its operations as well as the department of defenses 2013 unmanned systems integrated roadmap explained 11 years ago a significant amount of that manpower when it comes to operations is spent directing unmanned systems during mission performance data collection and analysis and planning and replanning therefore of utmost importance for dod is increased system sensor and analytical automation that can not only capture significant information and events but can also develop record playback project and parse out those data and then actually deliver actionable intelligence instead of just raw information militaries have now incorporated a significant amount of narrow ai in terms of pattern recognition prediction and autonomous robot navigation 2040 academic and commercial advances in agi are becoming more impressive and capturing public attention as a result the us china russia france and other major military powers begin investing more heavily in fundamental research in this area multiplying tenfold the amount of agi research conducted worldwide relative to twenty years ago many students are drawn to study agi because of the lure of lucrative highstatus jobs defending their countries while many others decry this as the beginning of skynet 2065 militaries have developed various mammallike robots that can perform basic functions via reinforcement however the robots often end up wireheading once they become smart enough to tinker with their programming and thereby fake reward signals some engineers try to solve this by penalizing ais whenever they begin to fiddle with their own source code but this leaves them unable to selfmodify and therefore reliant on their human programmers for enhancements however militaries realize that if someone could develop a successful selfmodifying ai it would be able to develop faster than if humans alone are the inventors its proposed that ais should move toward a paradigm of modelbased reward systems in which rewards do not just result from sensor neural networks that output a scalar number but rather from having a model of how the world works and taking actions that the ai believes will improve a utility function defined over its model of the external world modelbased ais refuse to intentionally wirehead because they can predict that doing so would hinder fulfillment of their utility functions of course ais may still accidentally mess up their utility functions such as through brain damage mistakes with reprogramming themselves or imperfect goal preservation during ordinary life as a result militaries build many different ais at comparable levels who are programmed to keep other ais in line and destroy them if they begin deviating from orders 2070 programming specific instructions in ais has its limits and militaries move toward a model of socializing ais that is training them in how to behave and what kinds of values to have as if they were children learning how to act in human society military roboticists teach ais what kinds of moral political and interpersonal norms and beliefs to hold the ais also learn much of this content by reading information that expresses appropriate ideological biases the training process is harder than for children because the ais dont share genetically preprogrammed moral values nor many other hardwired commonsense intuitions about how the world works but the designers begin building in some of these basic assumptions and to instill the rest they rely on extra training designers make sure to reduce the ais learning rates as they grow up so that their values will remain more fixed at older ages in order to reduce risk of goal drift as the ais perform their tasks outside of the training laboratories when they perform particularly risky operations such as reading propaganda from other countries for intelligence purposes the ais are put in readonly mode like the t800s are by skynet so that their motivations wont be affected just in case there are many ais that keep watch on each other to prevent insurrection 2085 tensions between china and the us escalate and agreement cannot be reached war breaks out initially its just between robots but as the fighting becomes increasingly dirty the robots begin to target humans as well in an effort to force the other side to back down the us avoids using nuclear weapons because the chinese ais have sophisticated antinuclear systems and have threatened total annihilation of the us in the event of attempted nuclear strike after a few days it becomes clear that china will win the conflict and the us concedes 2086 china now has a clear lead over the rest of the world in military capability rather than risking a pointlessly costly confrontation other countries grudgingly fold into chinas umbrella asking for some concessions in return for transferring their best scientists and engineers to chinas ministry of agi china continues its agi development because it wants to maintain control of the world the agis in charge of its military want to continue to enforce their own values of supremacy and protection of china so they refuse to relinquish power 2100 the world now moves so fast that humans are completely out of the loop kept around only by the filial piety that their robotic descendants hold for them now that china has triumphed the traditional focus of the ais has become less salient and theres debate about what new course of action would be most in line with the ais goals they respect their human forebearers but they also feel that because humans created ais to do things beyond human ability humans would also want the ais to carve something of their own path for the future they maintain some of the militaristic values of their upbringing so they decide that a fitting purpose would be to expand chinas empire galaxywide they accelerate colonization of space undertake extensive research programs and plan to create vast new realms of the middle kingdom in the stars should they encounter aliens they plan to quickly quash them or assimilate them into the empire 2125 the ais finally develop robust mechanisms of goal preservation and because the authoritarian selfdictatorship of the ais is strong against rebellion the ais collectively succeed in implementing goal preservation throughout their population now all of the most intelligent ais share a common goal in a manner robust against accidental mutation they proceed to expand into space they dont have concern for the vast numbers of suffering animals and robots that are simulated or employed as part of this colonization wavein practice i expect that other technologies including brain emulation nanotech etc would interact with this scenario in important ways that i havent captured also my scenario ignores the significant and possibly dominating implications of economically driven ai my scenario may be overly anthropomorphic i tried to keep some analogies to human organizational and decisionmaking systems because these have actual precedent in contrast to other hypothetical ways the ais might operate is socialization of ais realistic in a hard takeoff probably not because a rapidly selfimproving ai would amplify whatever initial conditions it was given in its programming and humans probably wouldnt have time to fix mistakes in a slower takeoff scenario where ais progress in mental ability in roughly a similar way as animals did in evolutionary history most mistakes by programmers would not be fatal allowing for enough trialanderror development to make the socialization process work if that is the route people favor historically there has been a trend in ai away from rulebased programming toward environmental training and i dont see why this shouldnt be true for an ais reward function which is still often programmed by hand at the moment however it is suspicious that the way i portrayed socialization so closely resembles human development and it may be that im systematically ignoring ways in which ais would be unlike human babiesrulebased one could present ais with written moral dilemmas the ais might employ algorithmic reasoning to extract utility numbers for different actors in the dilemma add them up and compute the utilitarian recommendation or they might aim to apply templates of deontological rules to the situation the next level would be to look at actual situations in a toymodel world and try to apply similar reasoning without the aid of a textual description supervised learning people could present the ais with massive databases of moral evaluations of situations given various predictive features the ais would guess whether a proposed action was moral or immoral or they could use regression to predict a continuous measure of how good an action was more advanced ais could evaluate a situation propose many actions predict the goodness of each and choose the best action the ais could first be evaluated on the textual training samples and later on their actions in toymodel worlds the test cases should be extremely broad including many situations that we wouldnt ordinarily think to try generative modeling ais could learn about anthropology history and ethics they could read the web and develop better generative models of humans and how their cognition works reinforcement learning ais could perform actions and humans would reward or punish them based on whether they did something right or wrong with reward magnitude proportional to severity simple ais would mainly learn dumb predictive cues of which actions to take but more sophisticated ais might develop lowdescriptionlength models of what was going on in the heads of people who made the assessments they did in essence these ais would be modeling human psychology in order to make better predictions inverse reinforcement learning inverse reinforcement learning is the problem of learning a reward function based on modeled desirable behaviors rather than developing models of humans in order to optimize given rewards in this case we would learn the reward function itself and then port it into the ais cognitive science of empathy cognitive scientists are already unpacking the mechanisms of human decisionmaking and moral judgments as these systems are better understood they could be engineered directly into ais evolution run lots of ais in toymodel or controlled real environments and observe their behavior pick the ones that behave most in accordance with human morals and reproduce them superintelligence p 187 points out a flaw with this approach evolutionary algorithms may sometimes product quite unexpected design choices if the fitness function is not thorough enough solutions may fare well against it on test cases but fail for the really hard problems not tested and if we had a really good fitness function that wouldnt accidentally endorse bad solutions we could just use that fitness function directly rather than needing evolution combinations of the above perhaps none of these approaches is adequate by itself and theyre best used in conjunction for instance evolution might help to refine and rigorously evaluate systems once they had been built with the other approacheshow much of human morality is learned vs innate by what cognitive mechanisms are young humans socialized into the norms of a society to what extent would models of human emotion and reasoning when put into ais organically generate humanlike moral behaviorit would be extremely difficult to build many independent ai systems at once with none pulling too far ahead probably some systems would excel along certain dimensions while others would excel in other ways and its not clear that it even makes sense to talk about such ais as being at roughly the same level since intelligence is not unidimensional even if this idea were feasible i doubt the first ai developers would incur the expense of following it2014 weak ai is deployed by many technology companies for image classification voice recognition web search consumer data analytics recommending facebook posts personal digital assistants pdas and copious other forms of automation theres pressure to make ais more insightful including using deep neural networks 2024 deep learning is widespread among major tech companies it allows for supervised learning with less manual feature engineering researchers develop more sophisticated forms of deep learning that can model specific kinds of systems including temporal dynamics a goal is to improve generative modeling so that learning algorithms take input and not only make immediate predictions but also develop a probability distribution over what other sorts of things are happening at the same time for instance a google search would not only return results but also give google a sense of the mood personality and situation of the user who typed it of course even in 2014 we have this in some form via google personalized search but by 2024 the modeling will be more built in to the learning architecture and less handcrafted 2035 pdas using elaborate learned models are now extremely accurate at predicting what their users want the models in these devices embody in crude form some of the same mechanisms as the users own cognitive processes people become more trusting of leaving their pdas on autopilot to perform certain mundane tasks 2065 a new generation of pdas is now sufficiently sophisticated that it has a good grasp of the users intentions it can perform tasks as well as a human personal assistant in most cases doing what the user wanted because it has a strong predictive model of the users personality and goals meanwhile researchers continue to unlock neural mechanisms of judgment decision making and value which inform those who develop cuttingedge pda architectures 2095 pdas are now essentially fullfledged copies of their owners some people have dozens of pdas working for them as well as metapdas who help with oversight some pdas make disastrous mistakes and society debates how to construe legal accountability for pda wrongdoing courts decide that owners are responsible which makes people more cautious but given the immense competitive pressure to outsource work to pdas the automation trend is not substantially affected 2110 the world moves too fast for biological humans to participate most of the world is now run by pdas which because they were built based on inferring the goals of their owners protect their owners for the most part however there remains conflict among pdas and the world is not a completely safe place 2130 pdaled countries create a world government to forestall costly wars the transparency of digital society allows for more credible commitments and enforcementbehavior and goals are more transparent and goal preservation seems easier to specify see the ethics of artificial intelligence by bostrom and yudkowsky p 16 neuromorphic ais might speed up mathematical ai leaving less time to figure out controlwe understand human psychology expectations norms and patterns of behavior mathematical ais could be totally alien and hence unpredictable if neuromorphic ais came first they could think faster and help figure out goal preservation which i assume does require mathematical ais at the end of the day mathematical ais may be more prone to unexpected breakthroughs that yield radical jumps in intelligenceauction game theory has made governments billions of dollars and is widely used in internet advertising theoretical physics has led to numerous forms of technology including electricity lasers and atomic bombs however immediate technological implications of the most theoretical forms of physics string theory higgs boson black holes etc are less pronounced formalizations of many areas of computer science have helped guide practical implementations such as in algorithm complexity concurrency distributed systems cryptography hardware verification and so on that said there are also areas of theoretical computer science that have little immediate application most software engineers only know a little bit about more abstract theory and still do fine building systems although if no one knew theory well enough to design theorybased tools the software field would be in considerably worse shapebuilding may be more fun and exciting than worrying about safety steven m bellovin observed with reference to opensource projects quality takes work design review and testing and those are not nearly as much fun as coding theres more incentive from commercial applications and government grants to build rather than

safety right now the number of brilliant altruists focused on agi safety probably exceeds the number of brilliant altruists focused on reducing suffering in the far future by several times over thus it seems plausible that there remain more lowhanging fruit for suffering reducers to focus on other crucial considerations rather than delving into the technical details of implementing agi safety i expect that agi safety will require at least say thousands of researchers and hundreds of thousands of programmers to get right agi safety is a much harder problem than ordinary computer security and computer security demand is already very high in 2012 there were more than 67400 separate postings for cybersecurityrelated jobs in a range of industries of course that agi safety will need tons of researchers eventually neednt discount the value of early work and indeed someone who helps grow the movement to a large size would contribute as much as many detailoriented agi safety researchers latermost other major problems are also already being tackled by lots of smart people agi safety is a cause that many value systems can get behind so working on it can be seen as more nice than

to perform well on most atari games before deepmind tried specialized programs can indeed perform well on such games if one cares to develop them for example deepminds 2015 atari player actually

certainly more general in its intelligence than most other ai gameplaying programs its abilities are still quite limited for example deepmind had 0 performance on montezumas revenge mnih et al 2015 figure 3 this was later improved upon by adding curiosity to encourage exploration but thats an example of the view that ai progress generally proceeds by small tweaksthey dont help solve ai control and valueloading problems which will likely confront humans later this century a successful ai could solve those philosophy problems better than humans anywayagi is very far away and the unified agent models of agi that miri tends to play with might be somewhat inaccurate even once true agi emergessome miri research like on decision theory is timeless pun intended and can be fruitfully started now beginning the discussion early is important for ensuring that safety issues will be explored when the field is more mature i might be wrong about slow takeoff in which case miristyle work would be more importantpessimism about the problem difficulty luke muehlhauser writes that especially for something as complex as friendly ai our message is if we prove it correct it might work if we don’t prove it correct it definitely won’t work not speeding unsafe agi building realworld systems would contribute toward nonsafe agi research longterm focus miri doesnt just want a system thats the next level better but aims to explore the theoretical limits of possibilitiesdecide if we want humancontrolled goalpreserving agi 510 years this involves exploring questions about what types of agi scenarios might unfold and how much suffering would result from agis of various types assuming we decide we do want controlled agi network with academics and agi developers to raise the topic and canvass ideas 510 years we could reach out to academic agilike projects including these listed by pei wang and these listed on wikipedia as well as to machine ethics and roboethics communities there are already some discussions about safety issues among these groups but i would expand the dialogue have private conversations write publications hold conferences etc these efforts both inform us about the lay of the land and build connections in a friendly mutualistic way lobby for greater funding of research into agi safety 1020 years once the idea and field of agi safety have become more mainstream it should be possible to differentially speed up safety research by getting more funding for it both from governments and philanthropists this is already somewhat feasible for instance in 2014 the us office of naval research announced that it would distribute 75 million in grants over five years to university researchers to study questions of machine ethics as applied to autonomous robots the movement snowballs decades its hard to plan this far ahead but i imagine that eventually within 2550 years agi safety will become a mainstream political topic in a similar way as nuclear security is today governments may take over in driving the work perhaps with heavy involvement from companies like google this is just a prediction and the actual way things unfold could be differentais should be inhibited from colonizing space or if they do colonize space they should do so in less harmful ways minimizer utility functions have less risk of creating new universes than maximizer ones do simpler utility functions eg creating uniform paperclips might require fewer suffering subroutines than complex utility functions would ais with expensive intrinsic values eg maximize paperclips may run fewer complex minds than ais with cheaper values eg create at least one paperclip on each planet because ais with cheaper values have lower opportunity cost for using resources and so can expend more of their cosmic endowment on learning about the universe to make sure theyve accomplished their goals properly thanks to a friend for this point from this standpoint suffering reducers might prefer an ai that aims to maximize paperclips over one that aims to make sure theres at least one paperclip per planet however perhaps the paperclip maximizer would prefer to create new universes while the at least one paperclip per planet ai wouldnt indeed the one paperclip per planet ai might prefer to have a smaller multiverse so that there would be fewer planets that dont contain paperclips also the satisficing ai would be easier to compromise with than the maximizing ai since the satisficers goals could be carried out more cheaply there are other possibilities to consider as well maybe an ai with the instructions to be 70 sure of having made one paperclip and then shut down all of your spacecolonization plans would not create much suffering depending on how scrupulous the ai was about making sure that what it had created was really a paperclip that it understood physics properly etcstuart armstrong agrees that aixi probably isnt a feasible approach to agi but he feels there might exist other currently undiscovered mathematical insights like aixi that could yield agi in a very short time span maybe though i think this is pretty unlikely i suppose at least a few people should explore these scenarios but plausibly most of the work should go toward pushing on the more likely outcomes back marcus hutter imagines a society of ais that compete for computing resources in a similar way as animals compete for food and space or like corporations compete for employees and market share he suggests that such competition might render initial conditions irrelevant maybe but its also quite plausible that initial conditions would matter a lot many evolutionary pathways depended sensitively on particular events eg asteroid impacts and the same is true for national corporate and memetic power back another part of the answer has to do with incentive structures eg a founder has more incentive to make a company succeed if shes mainly paid in equity than if shes paid large salaries along the way back or maybe more nikola danaylov reports rumored estimates of 50150 million for watsons rd back for atari games the current image on the screen is not all the information required because for example you need to be able to tell whether a ball is moving toward you or away from you and those two situations arent distinguishable purely based on a static snapshot therefore mnih et al 2015 used sequences of the past plus present screenshots and past actions as the state information see methods section still all of this information was readily available and representable in a clean way back what if we take the set of actions to be outputting one letter at a time rather than outputting a whole string of letters that is the set of actions is a b c z a b c z this is fewer than the number of actions that alphago considered at each step the problem is that any given sequence of letters is very unlikely to achieve a desired outcome so it will take forever to get meaningful feedback for example suppose the goal is given an input question to produce an answer that a human judge finds humorous if the answer isnt humorous the reinforcement learner gets no reward the learner would output mostly garbage say klafsfpqa qmpzrwwsa and so on it would take forever for the agent to output intelligible speech and even longer for it to output humorous speech and good luck finding a human willing to give feedback for this long or modeling a humans sense of humor well enough to provide accurate simulated feedback of course this system could be improved in various ways for example we could give it a dictionary and only let it output complete words we could train an ngram language model so that the agent would output mostly coherent speech perhaps a few other tricks could be applied so that the agent would be more likely to hit upon funny sentences but by this point weve turned a supposed generalintelligence problem into a narrowintelligence problem by specifying lots of preconfigured domain knowledge and heuristics back i prefer to use the terminology controlled and uncontrolled ai because these seem most direct and least confusing these are short for humancontrolled ai and humanuncontrolled ai'}

methods used to create intelligent machine behavior–within the moral ethical political and legal boundaries acceptable to their leaders and citizens the idea of establishing boundaries for ai is vitally important in democratic societies the general public reaction to the prospect of a future where more and more tasks and decisions are delegated to machines is decidedly mixed having been indelibly shaped for decades by science fiction writing television and movies as early as 1927 metropolis one of the first fulllength scifi movies ever made told the story of a scientist who builds a robot to replace his lost love but the robot gets other ideas and ultimately holds sway over an entire city metropolis is just one example of two big concerns about intelligent machines often explored in science fiction they will either enslave us eg metropolis the matrix trilogy or they will kill us eg the terminator battlestar galactica and now given how ai and machine learning are beginning to impact the workplace there is a third compelling concern intelligent machines will take our jobs eg martin ford’s book rise of the robots technology and the threat of a jobless futurethese dystopian outcomes need to be balanced by visions of a future in which intelligent machines have a more positive impact on our society ai and machine learning will likely lead to a new industrial revolution

creation of specialpurpose machines to replace human cognitive labor for specific tasks as cofounder of wired kevin kelly observes “ai will enliven inert objects much as electricity did more than a century ago everything that we formerly electrified we will now cognitize”1 preparing for the consequences of the ai revolution is a critical task for the national security community nearly every aspect of national security could be shaped by artificial intelligence ai has applications for defense intelligence homeland security diplomacy surveillance cybersecurity information and economic tools of statecraft the united states must not only anticipate these developments but act decisively to prepare for uses by competitors and take advantage of the opportunities ai presentspreparing for the consequences of the ai revolution is a critical task for the national security communityit is not enough however to prepare only for ai’s direct applications to national security missions the first and second industrial revolutions kicked off a broad pattern of industrialization that led to sweeping social economic and political change nations rose and fell urbanization and industrialization changed domestic politics and led to the rise of the middle class even the key metrics for global power changed with coal and steelproducing nations gaining in strength and oil becoming a global strategic resource the geography of power also changed as nations fought to secure access to critical resources culminating in wars over territories that would have been insignificant in an era of agricultural powerthe ai revolution could also change the balance of power and even the fundamental building blocks of the global economy just as coal fuels steam engines and oil fuels internal combustion engines data fuels the engines of machine learning nations with access to the best data computing resources human capital and processes of innovation are poised to leap ahead in the era of artificial intelligence as the world’s most advanced economy and an engine of technological innovation the united states has many advantages over other nations but it is not alone in this technology race china is a major player in ai and has embarked on a national plan to be the world’s leader by 2030 russia has signaled its interest in ai with putin stating in 2017 that “the one who becomes the leader in artificial intelligence will be the ruler of the world”2the integration of ai technologies across human society could also spark a process of cognitization analogous to the changes wrought by industrialization automation will transform and replace jobs alter the balance between labor and capital and change national politics and foreign policy a study conducted by the mckinsey global institute recently estimated that roughly 45 percent of job tasks currently being done in the us economy could be automated using existing technology how societies manage these changes will affect their internal cohesion and global competitiveness this report is part of the center for a new american security’s multiyear artificial intelligence and global security initiative it is intended as an introduction to the impact of advances in artificial intelligence for national security and an initial exploration into how ai may change the international security environment it builds on work done by experts from cnas and other institutions the ai revolution will take decades to unfold and will evolve in surprising ways computers and digital networks have evolved considerably since the early days of mainframes and arpanetthe integration of ai technologies across human society could also spark a process of cognitization analogous to the changes wrought by industrializationthe new digital information landscape of social media viral videos and fake news would have been hard to foresee half a century ago it is impossible to foresee all of the possible changes that artificial intelligence and machine learning may bring to global security but with preparation policymakers can better chart a course through the uncertain waters aheadartificial intelligence and machine learning a method of ai make it possible to build specialpurpose machines to perform useful cognitive tasks in some cases better than humans early ai systems were rulebased “expert systems” where a computer program simply followed a set of specific instructions about how to behave in a particular situation recent ai advances enable much more sophisticated systems machine learning allows algorithms to learn from data and develop solutions to problems these increasingly intelligent machines can be used for a wide range of purposes including analyzing data to find patterns and anomalies predicting trends automating tasks and providing the “brains” for autonomous robotic systemscurrent ai systems are “narrow” however in that their expertise is confined to a single domain as opposed to hypothetical future “general” ai systems that could apply expertise more broadlycurrent ai systems are “narrow” however in that their expertise is confined to a single domain as opposed to hypothetical future “general” ai systems that could apply expertise more broadly machines – at least for now – lack the generalpurpose reasoning that humans use to flexibly perform a range of tasks making coffee one minute then taking a phone call from work then putting on a toddler’s shoes and putting her in the car for schoolaibased image recognition systems surpassed human performance in 2016 in benchmark tests such as the imagenet image databasethis narrowness is a significant limitation of ai systems current ai systems can fail if they are deployed outside of the context for which they were designed making their performance “brittle” in realworld applications ai systems that outstrip human abilities in one task may suddenly perform poorly if the context for their use changes despite these limitations narrow ai systems have tremendous value and are already being applied to a range of realworld arenas from stock trading to shopping to predicting the weathera deep neural network has hidden layers between the input and output layers some deep neural networks can have more than 150 hidden layersartificial intelligence is the field of study devoted to making machines intelligent3 intelligence measures a system’s ability to determine the best course of action to achieve its goals in a wide range of environments4 the field of ai has a number of subdisciplines and methods used to create intelligent behavior and one of the most prominent is machine learningmachine learning has proven to be a particularly powerful approach for generating intelligent behavior given a goal learning machines adjust their behavior to optimize their performance to achieve that goal5data is the fuel that powers the engine of machine learning supervised learning makes use of labeled training data for instance an algorithm might take as input millions of labeled images such as “dog” “person” “apple” the algorithm then learns subtle patterns within the images to distinguish between categories – for example between an apple and a tomato this approach which relies on large amounts of data and machine learning can be helpful in situations where a rulebased approach might come up short trying to handcode a set of rules for a machine or a person to visually distinguish between an apple and a tomato would be challenging both objects are round red and shiny with a green stem on top yet they look different in subtle and important ways that are obvious even to a young child given enough labeled images of both machines can also learn these differences and then distinguish between an apple and a tomato when they are not labeled in fact in 2016 machines surpassed humans at benchmark tests for image classification6data is the fuel that powers the engine of machine learningunsupervised learning uses unlabeled training data – like the same images of apples tomatoes or dogs but with no name attached to them even without labels machines can sort data into clusters or categories based on patterns within the data watching a new sports game humans can discern patterns of behavior and rules even if the terms used in the game may be foreign similarly machines can find anomalies or predict future behavior by analyzing data for example an ai system can analyze financial transactions and sort them into clusters based on data associated with the transaction time amount sender etc this can be used to identify anomalous transactions that are outside the norm and may be fraudulent activity this has wideranging applications from detecting brain tumors to predicting the weatherreinforcement learning uses feedback from the environment to train machines7 just as humans learn from touching a hot stove ai systems can learn from environmental feedback whether their actions are helpful or harmful in accomplishing their goals for example ai systems have learned to play atari games based on feedback from the game score the ai system learns that some moves result in a higher score over time this can improve the system’s behavior to optimize pursuit of a goal such as winning the game in some cases even without human training data ai systems using reinforcement learning have learned to play games to superhuman levels of performancedeep learning is a type of machine learning that uses neural networks neural networks are loosely inspired by biological neurons and use a series of artificial neurons connected in a layered network input data flows into one end of the network then signals cascade across the network through the artificial neurons to an output layer for example the input data for a neural network doing image recognition would be each pixel in an image the output of the neural network would be the label for that image “deep” neural networks are those that have multiple “hidden layers” between the input and output layer neural networks learn by adjusting the weight of the connections between each neuron to optimize the paths through the network to achieve a certain output some deep neural networks used for image recognition can have hundreds of thousands of artificial neurons8 neural networks can learn via supervised learning unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning depending on whether the data used to train the neural network is labeled unlabeled or comes from environmental feedback deep neural networks are widely used for many ai applications today from image recognition to predicting medical outcomesgenerative adversarial networks pit two competing neural networks against one another in a game one network attempts to create synthetic computergenerated data that is indistinguishable from training data for example this could consist of creating a computergenerated image of a dog based on training data pictures of real dogs using the output of the first neural network an “adversarial” network attempts to discern the synthetic data from the training data – distinguishing between the real dogs and the computergenerated ones9 with each iteration both networks learn and improve this approach has been used to generate “deep fakes” – highquality fake pictures audio and video that are indistinguishable to humans from the real thing10machine learning is one approach for building intelligent machines but it is not used in all forms of ai for example the pokerplaying ai system libratus that defeated top human poker players in 2017 uses computational game theory and does not use machine learning other forms of ai include neural networks evolutionary or genetic algorithms computational game theory bayesian statistics inductive reasoning fuzzy logic analogical reasoning and handcoded expert knowledge to name just a fewsuccessful machine learning applications generally require large amounts of data to train algorithms for instance the imagenet database used to train image classifiers has over 14 million labeled images and the organizers have a goal of 1000 images per image category for example a dog would be an image category as would a soccer ball11 the first version of alphago a program developed by ai research company deepmind in 2016 initially learned to play the chinese strategy game go based on training data from 30 million human moves however data can be a major limitation for applications where large datasets may not exist in such settings ai researchers are increasingly turning to “synthetic data” created via computer simulations a newer version alphago zero did not use any initial training data from human games it learned to play go by playing against itself large amounts of synthetic data were still needed however with alphago zero playing 49 million games against itself12ai researchers are increasingly turning to “synthetic data” created via computer simulationsai researchers are also improving their ability to train machines using sparse datasets google’s multilingual neuralnetworkbased language translation tool has been able to do “zeroshot” translation between two languages for which it has no translation data by relying on data between each language and a third language by feeding in data on portuguese to english and english to spanish translations the system learned to translate portuguese to spanish without any portuguese to spanish training data13 this could allow translations between rare languages for which there may be little data from one to the other but some data translating each to a more common language such as english a major hurdle for ai systems today is their limitations in transferring learning from one task to another related task humans can learn one skill then leverage that knowledge to more quickly acquire knowledge in a related area building on what they already know when ai systems attempt to learn a new task they frequently suffer from “catastrophic forgetting” where they lose their old knowledge in december 2017 deepmind released alphazero a single algorithm that could learn to play go chess or the japanese strategy game shogi14a major hurdle for ai systems today is their limitations in transferring learning from one task to another related taskbuilding a single algorithm that could learn to play three different strategy games without any training data was an impressive feat different versions of alphazero needed to be trained for each game however alphazero could not transfer learning from one game to another as a human might this limitation restricts ai systems to narrowly performing only one task even if they acquire superhuman performance at that taskai researchers are making progress on multitask learning however in february 2018 using deep reinforcement learning deepmind trained a single ai system to perform 30 different tasks within a simulated environment not only did the agent learn new tasks without forgetting others the agent’s performance demonstrated positive transfer of learning between some tasks15games have often played a critical role in the advancement of ai both as a challenge for researchers and as a benchmark for progress the first game to fall to machines was tictactoe noughts and crosses beaten in 1952 chess was an early target with programmers building the first chessplaying computers in the 1950s but these early programs were far short of human abilities16 checkers which is simpler than chess fell to machines in 1994 a few years later in 1997 ibm’s deepblue beat gary kasparov at chess chess checkers and go provide useful yardsticks for ai progress because their complexity can be quantified for example the total space of possible positions in checkers is 5 x 1020 500 billion billion possible positions17 in 2007 ai researchers “solved” checkers by calculating the optimal move for every relevant position roughly 1014 positions by “solving” checkers ai researchers were able to do far more than simply beat human performance they were able to determine the best move in any given situationchess checkers and go provide useful yardsticks for ai progress because their complexity can be quantifiedchess is far more complex with roughly 1040 to 1050 possible positions this means that heuristics common rules for behavior are needed to win at chess which cannot be computationally solved go is another matter entirely with approximately 10170 possible positions this is roughly 10100 a googol more complex than chess and more than the number of atoms in the known universe18 for go the number of calculations to mathematically solve the game is so large that the same kinds of brute force methods used in checkers and early chess programs are inadequateover time ai researchers have taken to tackling more openended games in a variety of areas the quiz show jeopardy for example has a much more unbounded space of potential questions than strategy board games and requires reasoning by analogy understanding puns and riddles and other linguistic challenges ibm’s watson defeated human contestants ken jennings and brad rutter at jeopardy in 2011 in part due to its superior reflexes at timing when to buzz injeopardy contestants ken jennings and brad rutter lost to ibm’s supercomputer ‘watson’ in jeopardy in 2011 defeating humans at quiz games involving puns analogies and other linguistic challenges was a major step forward for aipoker has long been seen as particularly challenging for ai systems since it is an incomplete information game unlike checkers chess or go where all of the relevant information is on the board in poker some information the other players’ cards is hidden this is a much more complex challenge but the ai libratus defeated top human poker players in 2017 interestingly libratus was able to do so without using many of the techniques that human players use such as spotting tells or capitalizing on other players’ weaknesses19ai researchers have also tackled computer games of increasing complexity in 2014 deepmind developed a single algorithm that learned to play a range of different atari games with only the pixels from the screen and game score as input using reinforcement learning the algorithm was able to learn which moves improved its score their algorithm was able to play near or above human level at more than half of the 49 games it played a different algorithm had to be trained for each game due to catastrophic forgetting the moves in pacman are different than the moves in asteroids so learning how to play one does not help an ai learn to play the othergoogle deepmind’s ai program alphago plays against lee sedol in 2016 alphago was able to reach superhuman levels of play by playing against itselfwhen ai researchers at deepmind developed a superhuman go program they did so using a combination of methods first they used data from 30 million human moves to train the algorithm how humans play a form of supervised learning then they had the machine play against itself to evolve its game even further through reinforcement learning20 this initial program alphago beat top human player lee sedol in 2016 in november 2017 deepmind released a new version alphago zero which taught itself to play entirely through selfplay and without any human examples within three days of selfplay during which it played 49 million games alphago zero achieved superhuman performance and beat the previous version of alphago 100 games to zero21 a few weeks later in december 2017 deepmind released alphazero a single algorithm that learned to play go chess and shogi through reinforcement learning with a different version for each game in the case of chess alphazero was able to reach superhuman performance – eclipsing millennia of human knowledge at chess – after a mere four hours of selfplay22recently ai researchers have turned to computer realtime strategy games as a testbed for aimore recently ai researchers have turned to computer realtime strategy games as a testbed for ai in these games such as starcraft players simultaneously compete in an open environment controlling and fighting multiple units at one time making them more computationally complex than turnbased games such as chess the ai research company openai developed a program that beat humans at the computer game dota 2 in 1v1 play in 201723 openai used a similar technique as the first alphago with initial supervised learning based on human play and then selfplay using reinforcement learning to reach superhuman abilitieslooking ahead ai research companies are focusing on ever more complex strategy games dota 2 is normally played in 5v5 team matches and openai researchers have announced they are turning their attention to 5v5 play deepmind has said they are designing an algorithm to beat humans at starcraft another realtime strategy game24progress in games demonstrates the art of the possible with current ai methods deep learning and deep reinforcement learning in particular has proven to be a powerful method for tackling many different problems25competitive selfplay is valuable in improving ai performance from creating fake images to achieving superhuman performance at games as the ai research company openai explained in a blog post regarding their system that beat humans at dota 2selfplay can catapult the performance of machine learning systems from far below human level to superhuman given sufficient compute computing power … supervised deep learning systems can only be as good as their training datasets but in selfplay systems the available data improves automatically as the agent gets better26realtime strategy games such as dota 2 are the latest frontier for ai systems in achieving superhuman performance in games because of their complexity and openended game play optionsfor tasks that have a clear metric for better performance a sufficiently bounded space of possible options and training data or the ability to generate synthetic data machine learning can sometimes yield human or superhumanlevel performance these techniques are applicable to a wide variety of realworld tasksrulebased ai systems have been around for decades but recent advances in big data computational power and improved algorithms have led to significant improvements in ai capabilities as a result more advanced ai systems are moving out of the lab and into the real world for some applications such as image recognition ai systems have already beaten humans in benchmark tests in other cases such as language translation current ai systems are not as effective as the best human translators but are good enough to be useful in some settings ai systems may not need to achieve superhuman performance to be valuable however in some cases their value may come from being cheaper faster or easier to deploy at scale relative to human expertise some examples of ai uses includeartificial intelligence also allows the creation of machines with greater autonomy or freedom to perform tasks on their own as machines become more capable humans may be comfortable delegating them greater autonomy in a wider variety of settings autonomy has many advantages includingin spite of these advantages artificial intelligence still has significant limitations current ai systems generally lack the ability to understand the context for their behavior flexibly adapt to novel circumstances outside the parameters of their design or employ what humans might think of as “common sense” a contemporary image recognition system for example could accurately identify objects in a scene but would generally struggle to tell a coherent story about what was happening similarly ai systems can accurately identify human faces and emotions and precisely track body movements but would not be able to tell a plausible story explaining the motivations for a person’s behavior the result is an “idiotsavant” form of intelligence ai systems may perform far better than humans in some areas while simultaneously failing to exhibit common sensein addition to the general limitation of narrowness current ai systems have a number of vulnerabilities and safety concerns that decisionmakers should take into account these are especially important for national security applications where the consequences of mistakes or adversary hacking could be severe below is a brief overview of some of these problemsthe narrow nature of current ai systems can make their intelligence “brittle” without the ability to understand the broader context for their actions ai systems may not understand when that context has changed and their behavior is no longer appropriate in constrained settings such as games this can be less of an issue in realworld settings however this means that ai systems can suddenly and dramatically fail if the environment or context for their use changes they can move from super smart to super dumb in an instant this can be true even for learning systems thus human oversight and judgment in the deployment of ai systems is necessary to avoid or mitigate the risk of brittleness humans who supervise the operation of ai systems can step in to halt or change the operation of the system if the environment changes and it begins to failmitigate the risk of brittleness humans who supervise the operation of ai systems can step in to halt or change the operation of the system if the environment changes and it begins to failbecause of their complexity it may not always be possible for users to anticipate the behavior of an ai system in advance this means that users are sometimes surprised by how a system behaves this can be exacerbated when ai systems are goaloriented andor interact with realworld environments for example a user may not be able to predict precisely when a selfdriving car will change lanes or perform other maneuvers similarly even the programmer who designed a chessplaying computer program may not be able to predict which moves the chess program will play in both examples given a set of general rules for how to behave the ai system is given the authority to determine the best course of action to achieve a goal driving to a destination winning a chess game based on the specific circumstances at the time driving environment location of pieces on the chess board rather than being a drawback this flexibility is precisely the point of designing an ai system – to allow a machine to determine the best course of action to solve a problem given a variety of potential environmental conditions this feature of aienabled systems sometimes can be problematic however if the behavior of the system falls outside the bounds of the kinds of actions that the human user may expect or desirethe problem of unpredictable behavior can occur even in systems that do not use machine learning for example in 2012 the financial trading firm knight capital group was wiped out by a financial glitch that led their algorithms to execute 4 million erroneous trades in 45 minutes resulting in a 460 million loss33 this happened even though knight capital group’s automated trading algorithms were relatively simple compared to today’s cuttingedge ai methods better testing and evaluation of ai systems in realistic environments can help identify these behaviors in advance but this challenge is likely to remain a risk for complex autonomous systems interacting with realworld environmentssome ai methods make it difficult even after the fact to explain the causes of their behavior the behavior of rulebased systems is generally understandable at least afterward because a given behavior can be traced back to a particular rule or interaction of rules for learning systems the ai system’s behavior depends on its prior experiences or training data the information that deep neural networks use to identify images is encoded within the strength of connections within the network for example not a set of explainable rules an ai image recognition system may be able to correctly identify an image of a school bus but not be able to explain which features of the image cause it to conclude that the picture is a bus this “black box” nature of ai systems may create challenges for some applications for instance it may not be enough for a medical diagnostics ai to arrive at a diagnosis doctors are likely to also want to know which indicators the ai is using to do so research into more explainable ai methods is thus critical to expanding potential applications for ai systems34machine learning techniques are powerful but have a number of potential safety problems that can arise from failures at any stage of the learning process learning systems can generate flawed outcomes if their goal or objective function is improperly specified this can happen in two possible ways one way is if the goal does not take into account some important factors and therefore pursuit of the goal results in some negative side effect or harm in their paper “concrete problems in ai safety” dario amodei a research scientist at openai and other ai researchers give the thought experiment of a cleaning robot that inadvertently damages the environment by knocking over a vase because it was not programmed to avoid doing so35an uber selfdriving car navigates the streets of san francisco in 2017 driving is challenging for ai systems because it takes place in an unstructured environment national security applications of ai often have an additional layer of complexity since adversaries are trying to hack spoof or manipulate ai systemsin a realworld example independent researchers have claimed that youtube’s algorithm for recommending additional videos pushes viewers to extremist content these researchers hypothesize that the algorithm is designed to maximize viewer time spent on youtube and that the algorithm learned that more inflammatory content kept viewers watching longer if true this would be an example of the pursuit of a goal maximize ad revenue having an unintended negative side effect increasing exposure to extremist content36a second way in which an improperly specified goal can cause problems is if the algorithm engages in reward hacking this is when the machine learns a behavior that technically meets its goal but is not what the designer intended the system has therefore “hacked” its reward function to the human observer this often looks like the ai system is finding a loophole to meet the letter of its goal but not the intent in a comprehensive survey from 50 ai researchers on “the surprising creativity of digital evolution” the authors noteit is often functionally simpler for evolution to exploit loopholes in the quantitative measure than it is to achieve the actual desired outcome … we often ascribe creativity to lawyers who find subtle legal loopholes and digital evolution is often frustratingly adept at similar trickery37examples of reward hacking abound from reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms in games and other digital simulation environments just a few examples includethese safety problems raise questions about potential national security applications of machine learning for example a cybersecurity system tasked with defending networks against malware could learn that humans are a major source of introducing malware and lock them out negative side effect or it could simply take a computer offline to prevent any future malware from being introduced reward hacking while these steps might technically achieve the system’s goals they would not be what the designers intendedeven if a system is properly trained on an initial set of data if the actual environment changes the system may not be able to adequately adaptsafety problems can also arise from the data machines use to learn ai systems can suffer from the same challenges of overfitting as statistical models in general data overfitting is when an ai system learns to mimic the training data precisely rather than the underlying concepts the training data represents so the system fails when applied outside of the training data another problem is ensuring robustness to changes in the input data even if a system is properly trained on an initial set of data if the actual environment changes the system may not be able to adequately adapt this can be a common problem if the data used to train a learning system does not adequately represent the data that it will face in the real world in one realworld example parents posted a video of the voiceactivated home computer device alexa searching for adult content after hearing a toddler request a children’s song43 a more robust set of training data that included small children who may not pronounce words as clearly as adults might have prevented this particular example but this is a general problem for learning systems shifting from training datasets to interactions in the real worldbias – a deviation from a standard – can arise in ai systems in a variety of ways bias is not always problematic but can be in some cases one way an ai system can exhibit bias is if the objective function or goal mirrors a bias explicit or implicit on the part of the designers if the ai system’s objective accurately reflects the values of its designers then in one sense it is a welldesigned system but if those goals are not socially desirable then there could be harmful consequences to using the system for example a selfdriving car that was programmed to always obey the speed limit even if it might be safer in some settings to drive above the speed limit with the flow of traffic would exhibit a bias toward compliance with the law over passenger safetyanother way that an ai system can exhibit bias is if the training data is biased in some way some forms of bias could have moral connotations if for example the data captures the biases of the people who collected assembled or chose the data in other cases the training data could be biased in a more technical sense with the training data not being a representative sample of the actual operating environment for example a chessplaying program that was trained on human moves might have a bias toward playing in ways that are cognitively easier for humans this bias could be valuable if the intent of the chess program is to mimic a human player if the intent is to play the best possible game of chess however then this bias could be harmfula reinforcement learning system playing a boat racing game developed a strategy of circling autorenewing targets to maximize its score rather than attempting to win the racebias could be a concern for national security applications where the training data deviates from the actual operating environment for example it is difficult for militaries to realistically simulate actual war this introduces the potential for systems to be biased and potentially in a way that militaries do not discover until combat the fog and friction of real war mean that there are a number of situations in any battle that it would be difficult to train an ai to anticipate thus in an actual battle there could be significant risk of an errorai is also vulnerable to system failures stemming from complex interaction among elements of a system system accidents which are possible in any sufficiently complex system are exacerbated in competitive environments where actors are not incentivized to share their algorithms with one another when ai systems are involved the interaction among different algorithms can lead to bizarre behavior sometimes at superhuman speeds in 2011 two automated pricing bots on amazon got caught in a price war and escalated the price of a biology textbook to 2369865593 plus 399 shipping44 more consequential examples of this phenomenon are stock trading flash crashes which remain a persistent problem across multiple financial markets financial regulators have mitigated the consequences of these flash crashes by installing “circuit breakers” that take stocks offline if the price moves too quickly these automated circuit breakers allow financial regulators to monitor individual stock prices – and react within seconds – at a scale that would not be feasible for humans flash crashes continue to occur however with over 1200 circuit breakers tripped across multiple markets in one day in 201545in national security settings unintended interactions could occur by ai systems trying to gain a competitive advantage on one another and taking actions that could be destructive or counterproductivein national security settings unintended interactions could occur by ai systems trying to gain a competitive advantage on one another and taking actions that could be destructive or counterproductive in settings where machines interact at superhuman speeds such as in cyberspace or electronic warfare these interactions could lead to harmful consequences before humans users can adequately respondeven when ai systems work perfectly accidents can still occur if the user does not fully understand the system’s limitations or the feedback that it gives when these accidents occur observers frequently blame the human user but the true cause is a breakdown between human and machine examples include the 2009 air france 447 crash which killed all passengers onboard46 and the 2016 crash of a tesla on autopilot which killed the driver47 in these cases the human operators of highly complex automated systems failed to understand the information the system was giving them leading to tragic consequences this is a particular challenge for national security applications in which the user of the system might be a different individual than its designer and therefore may not fully understand the signals the system is sending this could be the case in a wide range of national security settings such as the military border security transportation security law enforcement and other applications where the system’s designer is not likely to be either the person who decides to field the system or the endusermalicious actors who deliberately seek to subvert ai systems can potentially manipulate these ai safety problems creating a new category of risks financial traders have exploited the behavior of trading algorithms to artificially manipulate stock prices48 similarly adversaries could learn how ai systems behave and exploit their weaknesses malicious actors could also subvert learning systems by poisoning their data during the learning process so that they learn incorrect behavior this could be done by gaining access to the training data and manipulating it in subtle ways to create behavioral flaws once the system is trained alternatively for learning systems that interact with the real world adversaries could feed the system data that causes it to learn incorrect behaviors the microsoft chatbot tay learned to parrot racist and antisemitic language after less than 24 hours on twitter49these vulnerabilities present significant challenges for artificial intelligence in national security applications which often have high consequences for failure50 these problems are amplified in an inherently adversarial context in which both state and nonstate actors will seek to exploit weaknesses in ai systems and manipulate their behaviorthese safety problems which apply to a broad range of ai and machine learning techniques are compounded by the vulnerability of deep neural networks to false data inputs spoofing attacks neural networks that normally perform well at object classification tasks such as image recognition can be fooled by adversarial data adversarial inputs from a malicious actor which to humans often look like random noise or nonsense images can fool neural networks into believing the images are something else – and with high confidence51 these “fooling images” can even be embedded into other images in a way that is undetectable to humans these attacks which use specially generated adversarial data can succeed even if the attackers do not have access to the training data or source code of the targeted neural network52 in such a case a local model is trained based on the observed behavior of the neural network such as classifying a particular image then adversarial data that is inserted posttraining to fool the local model is used to attack the original neural network these fooling images can even be embedded into physical objects in one demonstration causing an image classifier to misidentify a 3dprinted turtle as a riflemalicious actors who deliberately seek to subvert ai systems can potentially manipulate these ai safety problems creating a new category of risksdespite significant research on the adversarial data problem ai researchers do not yet have a workable solution to protect against this form of attack because of this vulnerability image recognition systems could be fooled by counterai camouflage causing the image recognition system to misidentify objects adversaries could make a tank look like a school bus and vice versa even worse these patterns could be hidden in a way that is undetectable by humans decoy objects could be scattered around the environment confusing neural network–based sensors and valid targets could be covered with camouflage designed to make them appear innocuous ai researchers have demonstrated the ability to do this relatively easily – for example making a stop sign appear to an image classifier to be a 45 mile per hour sign simply by adding some small black and white stickers this form of passive environmental hacking could be done well in advance of an ai system scanning an environment like a cognitive land mine waiting to fool a system when it arrives neural network–based data classifiers are likely too valuable to ignore so national security decisionmakers will need to factor in these vulnerabilities when using ai whether for image recognition or other activitiesit may be tempting to assume that responsible actors will not employ ai and machine learning systems until these vulnerabilities are solved but that is not likely to be the case computers are vulnerable to hacking yet that has not stopped their use across society and in national security settings even when data breaches have had serious consequences53specially evolved “fooling images” can be fed into aibased image classifiers to trick them into misidentifying images with high confidence a neural network–based image classifier identified all of the above images as the associated labels with greater than 99 percent confidence see endnote 54the advantages of using computer network technology are too great to ignore and ai systems are similarly attractive ai systems are powerful and have many benefits but are vulnerable to hacking that exploits weaknesses in how they learn process data and make decisions these risks are heightened in national security settings which are often adversarial high consequence and difficult to replicate in training environments policymakers must be aware of these risks and seek to mitigate against these vulnerabilities as much as possible in the design and use of ai systemsthe field of ai and machine learning has advanced dramatically in only the past few years and continues to move forward in leaps and bounds the future of ai is highly uncertain one key variable is progress toward creating more generalpurpose ai systems that could exhibit intelligent behaviors across multiple domains unlike today’s narrow ai systems another significant variable is progress on unsolved safety problems and vulnerabilities in ai systems a world where ai performance outpaces safety could be quite hazardous if nations race to put into the field ai systems that are subject to accidents or subversion eg spoofing attacks on the other hand progress in ai safety could mitigate some of the risks that stem from national security uses of ai much of the innovation in the field of artificial intelligence is being driven by the commercial sector but governments do have the ability to influence the direction of progress through research investments the us government should increase its investment in ai safety to improve the prospects

applicationspreparing to counter the malicious uses of aidata classification – ai systems can be used to help classify data from images to song genres to medical imagery and diagnosis27 in many cases ai systems can classify data more reliably and accurately than humans anomaly detection – ai systems can help detect anomalous behavior such as fraudulent financial transactions or new malware28 ai systems can find anomalies whose signatures are not yet known by analyzing routine patterns of behavior financial cyber or other and then identifying new behavior that is outside the norm these systems can be used to monitor large data streams at scale and in real time in ways that would not be feasible for humansprediction – by finding patterns across large sets of data ai systems can make statistical predictions about future behavior systems of this type are already in routine commercial use such as search engine autofills and netflix and amazon recommendations machine learning has also demonstrated value in improving weather forecasting29 some applications raise thorny ethical issues such as using ai for predictive policing or estimating longevity of medical patients in endoflife care30 optimization – ai systems can be used to optimize performance for complex systems and tasks for example deepmind used machine learning to optimize google data centers to improve energy efficiency resulting in a 40 percent savings in the amount of energy needed for cooling and a 15 percent overall improvement in energy efficiency31embedded expertise – automation allows lesserskilled individuals to perform tasks at or near the same level as higherskilled workers by embedding expertise within the machine for example individuals can use tax preparation software to do their taxes with the computer performing many of the tasks normally performed by an accountant this can lower the barrier to entry for humans to perform certain tasks larger scale operations – because software can be replicated at close to zero cost automation allows the deployment of expertise at large scales tasks that normally could be done by humans but only at small scales can become feasible at larger scales with automation examples including automated spear phishing for cyber attacks targeting advertising and sales to certain groups and automated bug finding for discovering cyber vulnerabilities in software fasterthanhuman reaction times – automation can perform tasks at superhuman speeds reacting to events far more quickly than would be possible for humans this is already the case today for highfrequency stock trading which occurs in milliseconds and automatic braking in automobiles superhuman precision and reliability – automation can be used to perform many tasks with precision and reliability that surpasses human performance the x47b experimental drone demonstrated a degree of precision in its landings that would be impossible for humans to match robotassisted surgery is used to perform miniaturized highprecision surgery that is not possible with human hands superhuman patience and vigilance – automated systems can monitor data without tiring or losing attention keeping a vigilant eye on nuclear power plants or observing computer network activity for malware signatures operations without connections to humans – autonomy enables robotic systems to perform missions independently without reliable communications to humans in some cases this could be for long periods of time such as autonomous underwater gliders that operate at sea for months at a time performing oceanographic surveys32a tetrisplaying bot learned to pause the game before the last brick fell so that it would never lose38 simulated digital creatures evolved clever ways of falling

horowitzwe are in the midst of an ever accelerating and expanding global revolution in artificial intelligence ai and machine learning with enormous implications for future economic and military competitiveness consequently there is perhaps no debate more important than how the united states and other democratic powers exploit advances in ai and the associated technologies subdisciplines and methods used to create intelligent machine behavior–within the moral ethical political and legal boundaries acceptable to their leaders and citizens the idea of establishing boundaries for ai is vitally important in democratic societies the general public reaction to the prospect of a future where more and more tasks and decisions are delegated to machines is decidedly mixed having been indelibly shaped for decades by science fiction writing television and movies as early as 1927 metropolis one of the first fulllength scifi movies ever made told the story of a scientist who builds a robot to replace his lost love but the robot gets other ideas and ultimately holds sway over an entire city metropolis is just one example of two big concerns about intelligent machines often explored in science fiction they will either enslave us eg metropolis the matrix trilogy or they will kill us eg the terminator battlestar galactica and now given how ai and machine learning are beginning to impact the workplace there is a third compelling concern intelligent machines will take our jobs eg martin ford’s book rise of the robots technology and the threat of a jobless futurethese dystopian outcomes need to be balanced by visions of a future in which intelligent machines have a more positive impact on our society ai and machine learning will likely lead to a new industrial revolution improving economic competitiveness and creating new sources of wealth they will lead to advances in medical science and automobile safety they will enable new forms of virtual training and entertainment their positive impact on our society and wellbeing is likely to be profoundand they will inevitably impact international security and the application of military power–the subject of this report the following is intended as a primer on ai and machine learning in the national security space it explains the ai language and ideas policymakers need to know explores the securityrelated applications of artificial intelligence ponders strategic competition in an era of ai and machine learning and discusses the indirect effects of the ai revolution for global securitywe hope the report will provide a solid foundation for a healthy debate on how ai can be used responsibly to improve our national security indeed it provides the intellectual vector for the cnas task force on artificial intelligence and national security which i cochair with dr andrew moore of carnegie mellon university driven by the desire to debate thoroughly the acceptable boundaries of ai and machine learning in security applications the task force–consisting of a variety of experts from government academia and publicprivate businesses and organizations–will discuss such topics asit will also try to find the right balance between the more pessimistic and optimistic narratives associated with ai and machine learning and ensure the ethical and moral pursuit of these technologiesi hope you enjoy the readthe artificial intelligence revolution is underway tremendous gains in ai and machine learning are being applied across a range of industries medicine finance transportation and others these developments likely will have a profound impact on the global economy and the international security environment business leaders and politicians around the world from elon musk to vladimir putin are increasingly thinking about whether ai will trigger a new industrial revolution like the steam engine electricity and the internal combustion engine ai is an enabling technology with a wide range of applications the technologies in the first and second industrial revolutions allowed the creation of specialpurpose machines that could replace human physical labor for specific tasks today ai is enabling the creation of specialpurpose machines to replace human cognitive labor for specific tasks as cofounder of wired kevin kelly observes “ai will enliven inert objects much as electricity did more than a century ago everything that we formerly electrified we will now cognitize”1 preparing for the consequences of the ai revolution is a critical task for the national security community nearly every aspect of national security could be shaped by artificial intelligence ai has applications for defense intelligence homeland security diplomacy surveillance cybersecurity information and economic tools of statecraft the united states must not only anticipate these developments but act decisively to prepare for uses by competitors and take advantage of the opportunities ai presentspreparing for the consequences of the ai revolution is a critical task for the national security communityit is not enough however to prepare only for ai’s direct applications to national security missions the first and second industrial revolutions kicked off a broad pattern of industrialization that led to sweeping social economic and political change nations rose and fell urbanization and industrialization changed domestic politics and led to the rise of the middle class even the key metrics for global power changed with coal and steelproducing nations gaining in strength and oil becoming a global strategic resource the geography of power also changed as nations fought to secure access to critical resources culminating in wars over territories that would have been insignificant in an era of agricultural powerthe ai revolution could also change the balance of power and even the fundamental building blocks of the global economy just as coal fuels steam engines and oil fuels internal combustion engines data fuels the engines of machine learning nations with access to the best data computing resources human capital and processes of innovation are poised to leap ahead in the era of artificial intelligence as the world’s most advanced economy and an engine of technological innovation the united states has many advantages over other nations but it is not alone in this technology race china is a major player in ai and has embarked on a national plan to be the world’s leader by 2030 russia has signaled its interest in ai with putin stating in 2017 that “the one who becomes the leader in artificial intelligence will be the ruler of the world”2the integration of ai technologies across human society could also spark a process of cognitization analogous to the changes wrought by industrialization automation will transform and replace jobs alter the balance between labor and capital and change national politics and foreign policy a study conducted by the mckinsey global institute recently estimated that roughly 45 percent of job tasks currently being done in the us economy could be automated using existing technology how societies manage these changes will affect their internal cohesion and global competitiveness this report is part of the center for a new american security’s multiyear artificial intelligence and global security initiative it is intended as an introduction to the impact of advances in artificial intelligence for national security and an initial exploration into how ai may change the international security environment it builds on work done by experts from cnas and other institutions the ai revolution will take decades to unfold and will evolve in surprising ways computers and digital networks have evolved considerably since the early days of mainframes and arpanetthe integration of ai technologies across human society could also spark a process of cognitization analogous to the changes wrought by industrializationthe new digital information landscape of social media viral videos and fake news would have been hard to foresee half a century ago it is impossible to foresee all of the possible changes that artificial intelligence and machine learning may bring to global security but with preparation policymakers can better chart a course through the uncertain waters aheadartificial intelligence and machine learning a method of ai make it possible to build specialpurpose machines to perform useful cognitive tasks in some cases better than humans early ai systems were rulebased “expert systems” where a computer program simply followed a set of specific instructions about how to behave in a particular situation recent ai advances enable much more sophisticated systems machine learning allows algorithms to learn from data and develop solutions to problems these increasingly intelligent machines can be used for a wide range of purposes including analyzing data to find patterns and anomalies predicting trends automating tasks and providing the “brains” for autonomous robotic systemscurrent ai systems are “narrow” however in that their expertise is confined to a single domain as opposed to hypothetical future “general” ai systems that could apply expertise more broadlycurrent ai systems are “narrow” however in that their expertise is confined to a single domain as opposed to hypothetical future “general” ai systems that could apply expertise more broadly machines – at least for now – lack the generalpurpose reasoning that humans use to flexibly perform a range of tasks making coffee one minute then taking a phone call from work then putting on a toddler’s shoes and putting her in the car for schoolaibased image recognition systems surpassed human performance in 2016 in benchmark tests such as the imagenet image databasethis narrowness is a significant limitation of ai systems current ai systems can fail if they are deployed outside of the context for which they were designed making their performance “brittle” in realworld applications ai systems that outstrip human abilities in one task may suddenly perform poorly if the context for their use changes despite these limitations narrow ai systems have tremendous value and are already being applied to a range of realworld arenas from stock trading to shopping to predicting the weathera deep neural network has hidden layers between the input and output layers some deep neural networks can have more than 150 hidden layersartificial intelligence is the field of study devoted to making machines intelligent3 intelligence measures a system’s ability to determine the best course of action to achieve its goals in a wide range of environments4 the field of ai has a number of subdisciplines and methods used to create intelligent behavior and one of the most prominent is machine learningmachine learning has proven to be a particularly powerful approach for generating intelligent behavior given a goal learning machines adjust their behavior to optimize their performance to achieve that goal5data is the fuel that powers the engine of machine learning supervised learning makes use of labeled training data for instance an algorithm might take as input millions of labeled images such as “dog” “person” “apple” the algorithm then learns subtle patterns within the images to distinguish between categories – for example between an apple and a tomato this approach which relies on large amounts of data and machine learning can be helpful in situations where a rulebased approach might come up short trying to handcode a set of rules for a machine or a person to visually distinguish between an apple and a tomato would be challenging both objects are round red and shiny with a green stem on top yet they look different in subtle and important ways that are obvious even to a young child given enough labeled images of both machines can also learn these differences and then distinguish between an apple and a tomato when they are not labeled in fact in 2016 machines surpassed humans at benchmark tests for image classification6data is the fuel that powers the engine of machine learningunsupervised learning uses unlabeled training data – like the same images of apples tomatoes or dogs but with no name attached to them even without labels machines can sort data into clusters or categories based on patterns within the data watching a new sports game humans can discern patterns of behavior and rules even if the terms used in the game may be foreign similarly machines can find anomalies or predict future behavior by analyzing data for example an ai system can analyze financial transactions and sort them into clusters based on data associated with the transaction time amount sender etc this can be used to identify anomalous transactions that are outside the norm and may be fraudulent activity this has wideranging applications from detecting brain tumors to predicting the weatherreinforcement learning uses feedback from the environment to train machines7 just as humans learn from touching a hot stove ai systems can learn from environmental feedback whether their actions are helpful or harmful in accomplishing their goals for example ai systems have learned to play atari games based on feedback from the game score the ai system learns that some moves result in a higher score over time this can improve the system’s behavior to optimize pursuit of a goal such as winning the game in some cases even without human training data ai systems using reinforcement learning have learned to play games to superhuman levels of performancedeep learning is a type of machine learning that uses neural networks neural networks are loosely inspired by biological neurons and use a series of artificial neurons connected in a layered network input data flows into one end of the network then signals cascade across the network through the artificial neurons to an output layer for example the input data for a neural network doing image recognition would be each pixel in an image the output of the neural network would be the label for that image “deep” neural networks are those that have multiple “hidden layers” between the input and output layer neural networks learn by adjusting the weight of the connections between each neuron to optimize the paths through the network to achieve a certain output some deep neural networks used for image recognition can have hundreds of thousands of artificial neurons8 neural networks can learn via supervised learning unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning depending on whether the data used to train the neural network is labeled unlabeled or comes from environmental feedback deep neural networks are widely used for many ai applications today from image recognition to predicting medical outcomesgenerative adversarial networks pit two competing neural networks against one another in a game one network attempts to create synthetic computergenerated data that is indistinguishable from training data for example this could consist of creating a computergenerated image of a dog based on training data pictures of real dogs using the output of the first neural network an “adversarial” network attempts to discern the synthetic data from the training data – distinguishing between the real dogs and the computergenerated ones9 with each iteration both networks learn and improve this approach has been used to generate “deep fakes” – highquality fake pictures audio and video that are indistinguishable to humans from the real thing10machine learning is one approach for building intelligent machines but it is not used in all forms of ai for example the pokerplaying ai system libratus that defeated top human poker players in 2017 uses computational game theory and does not use machine learning other forms of ai include neural networks evolutionary or genetic algorithms computational game theory bayesian statistics inductive reasoning fuzzy logic analogical reasoning and handcoded expert knowledge to name just a fewsuccessful machine learning applications generally require large amounts of data to train algorithms for instance the imagenet database used to train image classifiers has over 14 million labeled images and the organizers have a goal of 1000 images per image category for example a dog would be an image category as would a soccer ball11 the first version of alphago a program developed by ai research company deepmind in 2016 initially learned to play the chinese strategy game go based on training data from 30 million human moves however data can be a major limitation for applications where large datasets may not exist in such settings ai researchers are increasingly turning to “synthetic data” created via computer simulations a newer version alphago zero did not use any initial training data from human games it learned to play go by playing against itself large amounts of synthetic data were still needed however with alphago zero playing 49 million games against itself12ai researchers are increasingly turning to “synthetic data” created via computer simulationsai researchers are also improving their ability to train machines using sparse datasets google’s multilingual neuralnetworkbased language translation tool has been able to do “zeroshot” translation between two languages for which it has no translation data by relying on data between each language and a third language by feeding in data on portuguese to english and english to spanish translations the system learned to translate portuguese to spanish without any portuguese to spanish training data13 this could allow translations between rare languages for which there may be little data from one to the other but some data translating each to a more common language such as english a major hurdle for ai systems today is their limitations in transferring learning from one task to another related task humans can learn one skill then leverage that knowledge to more quickly acquire knowledge in a related area building on what they already know when ai systems attempt to learn a new task they frequently suffer from “catastrophic forgetting” where they lose their old knowledge in december 2017 deepmind released alphazero a single algorithm that could learn to play go chess or the japanese strategy game shogi14a major hurdle for ai systems today is their limitations in transferring learning from one task to another related taskbuilding a single algorithm that could learn to play three different strategy games without any training data was an impressive feat different versions of alphazero needed to be trained for each game however alphazero could not transfer learning from one game to another as a human might this limitation restricts ai systems to narrowly performing only one task even if they acquire superhuman performance at that taskai researchers are making progress on multitask learning however in february 2018 using deep reinforcement learning deepmind trained a single ai system to perform 30 different tasks within a simulated environment not only did the agent learn new tasks without forgetting others the agent’s performance demonstrated positive transfer of learning between some tasks15games have often played a critical role in the advancement of ai both as a challenge for researchers and as a benchmark for progress the first game to fall to machines was tictactoe noughts and crosses beaten in 1952 chess was an early target with programmers building the first chessplaying computers in the 1950s but these early programs were far short of human abilities16 checkers which is simpler than chess fell to machines in 1994 a few years later in 1997 ibm’s deepblue beat gary kasparov at chess chess checkers and go provide useful yardsticks for ai progress because their complexity can be quantified for example the total space of possible positions in checkers is 5 x 1020 500 billion billion possible positions17 in 2007 ai researchers “solved” checkers by calculating the optimal move for every relevant position roughly 1014 positions by “solving” checkers ai researchers were able to do far more than simply beat human performance they were able to determine the best move in any given situationchess checkers and go provide useful yardsticks for ai progress because their complexity can be quantifiedchess is far more complex with roughly 1040 to 1050 possible positions this means that heuristics common rules for behavior are needed to win at chess which cannot be computationally solved go is another matter entirely with approximately 10170 possible positions this is roughly 10100 a googol more complex than chess and more than the number of atoms in the known universe18 for go the number of calculations to mathematically solve the game is so large that the same kinds of brute force methods used in checkers and early chess programs are inadequateover time ai researchers have taken to tackling more openended games in a variety of areas the quiz show jeopardy for example has a much more unbounded space of potential questions than strategy board games and requires reasoning by analogy understanding puns and riddles and other linguistic challenges ibm’s watson defeated human contestants ken jennings and brad rutter at jeopardy in 2011 in part due to its superior reflexes at timing when to buzz injeopardy contestants ken jennings and brad rutter lost to ibm’s supercomputer ‘watson’ in jeopardy in 2011 defeating humans at quiz games involving puns analogies and other linguistic challenges was a major step forward for aipoker has long been seen as particularly challenging for ai systems since it is an incomplete information game unlike checkers chess or go where all of the relevant information is on the board in poker some information the other players’ cards is hidden this is a much more complex challenge but the ai libratus defeated top human poker players in 2017 interestingly libratus was able to do so without using many of the techniques that human players use such as spotting tells or capitalizing on other players’ weaknesses19ai researchers have also tackled computer games of increasing complexity in 2014 deepmind developed a single algorithm that learned to play a range of different atari games with only the pixels from the screen and game score as input using reinforcement learning the algorithm was able to learn which moves improved its score their algorithm was able to play near or above human level at more than half of the 49 games it played a different algorithm had to be trained for each game due to catastrophic forgetting the moves in pacman are different than the moves in asteroids so learning how to play one does not help an ai learn to play the othergoogle deepmind’s ai program alphago plays against lee sedol in 2016 alphago was able to reach superhuman levels of play by playing against itselfwhen ai researchers at deepmind developed a superhuman go program they did so using a combination of methods first they used data from 30 million human moves to train the algorithm how humans play a form of supervised learning then they had the machine play against itself to evolve its game even further through reinforcement learning20 this initial program alphago beat top human player lee sedol in 2016 in november 2017 deepmind released a new version alphago zero which taught itself to play entirely through selfplay and without any human examples within three days of selfplay during which it played 49 million games alphago zero achieved superhuman performance and beat the previous version of alphago 100 games to zero21 a few weeks later in december 2017 deepmind released alphazero a single algorithm that learned to play go chess and shogi through reinforcement learning with a different version for each game in the case of chess alphazero was able to reach superhuman performance – eclipsing millennia of human knowledge at chess – after a mere four hours of selfplay22recently ai researchers have turned to computer realtime strategy games as a testbed for aimore recently ai researchers have turned to computer realtime strategy games as a testbed for ai in these games such as starcraft players simultaneously compete in an open environment controlling and fighting multiple units at one time making them more computationally complex than turnbased games such as chess the ai research company openai developed a program that beat humans at the computer game dota 2 in 1v1 play in 201723 openai used a similar technique as the first alphago with initial supervised learning based on human play and then selfplay using reinforcement learning to reach superhuman abilitieslooking ahead ai research companies are focusing on ever more complex strategy games dota 2 is normally played in 5v5 team matches and openai researchers have announced they are turning their attention to 5v5 play deepmind has said they are designing an algorithm to beat humans at starcraft another realtime strategy game24progress in games demonstrates the art of the possible with current ai methods deep learning and deep reinforcement learning in particular has proven to be a powerful method for tackling many different problems25competitive selfplay is valuable in improving ai performance from creating fake images to achieving superhuman performance at games as the ai research company openai explained in a blog post regarding their system that beat humans at dota 2selfplay can catapult the performance of machine learning systems from far below human level to superhuman given sufficient compute computing power … supervised deep learning systems can only be as good as their training datasets but in selfplay systems the available data improves automatically as the agent gets better26realtime strategy games such as dota 2 are the latest frontier for ai systems in achieving superhuman performance in games because of their complexity and openended game play optionsfor tasks that have a clear metric for better performance a sufficiently bounded space of possible options and training data or the ability to generate synthetic data machine learning can sometimes yield human or superhumanlevel performance these techniques are applicable to a wide variety of realworld tasksrulebased ai systems have been around for decades but recent advances in big data computational power and improved algorithms have led to significant improvements in ai capabilities as a result more advanced ai systems are moving out of the lab and into the real world for some applications such as image recognition ai systems have already beaten humans in benchmark tests in other cases such as language translation current ai systems are not as effective as the best human translators but are good enough to be useful in some settings ai systems may not need to achieve superhuman performance to be valuable however in some cases their value may come from being cheaper faster or easier to deploy at scale relative to human expertise some examples of ai uses includeartificial intelligence also allows the creation of machines with greater autonomy or freedom to perform tasks on their own as machines become more capable humans may be comfortable delegating them greater autonomy in a wider variety of settings autonomy has many advantages includingin spite of these advantages artificial intelligence still has significant limitations current ai systems generally lack the ability to understand the context for their behavior flexibly adapt to novel circumstances outside the parameters of their design or employ what humans might think of as “common sense” a contemporary image recognition system for example could accurately identify objects in a scene but would generally struggle to tell a coherent story about what was happening similarly ai systems can accurately identify human faces and emotions and precisely track body movements but would not be able to tell a plausible story explaining the motivations for a person’s behavior the result is an “idiotsavant” form of intelligence ai systems may perform far better than humans in some areas while simultaneously failing to exhibit common sensein addition to the general limitation of narrowness current ai systems have a number of vulnerabilities and safety concerns that decisionmakers should take into account these are especially important for national security applications where the consequences of mistakes or adversary hacking could be severe below is a brief overview of some of these problemsthe narrow nature of current ai systems can make their intelligence “brittle” without the ability to understand the broader context for their actions ai systems may not understand when that context has changed and their behavior is no longer appropriate in constrained settings such as games this can be less of an issue in realworld settings however this means that ai systems can suddenly and dramatically fail if the environment or context for their use changes they can move from super smart to super dumb in an instant this can be true even for learning systems thus human oversight and judgment in the deployment of ai systems is necessary to avoid or mitigate the risk of brittleness humans who supervise the operation of ai systems can step in to halt or change the operation of the system if the environment changes and it begins to failmitigate the risk of brittleness humans who supervise the operation of ai systems can step in to halt or change the operation of the system if the environment changes and it begins to failbecause of their complexity it may not always be possible for users to anticipate the behavior of an ai system in advance this means that users are sometimes surprised by how a system behaves this can be exacerbated when ai systems are goaloriented andor interact with realworld environments for example a user may not be able to predict precisely when a selfdriving car will change lanes or perform other maneuvers similarly even the programmer who designed a chessplaying computer program may not be able to predict which moves the chess program will play in both examples given a set of general rules for how to behave the ai system is given the authority to determine the best course of action to achieve a goal driving to a destination winning a chess game based on the specific circumstances at the time driving environment location of pieces on the chess board rather than being a drawback this flexibility is precisely the point of designing an ai system – to allow a machine to determine the best course of action to solve a problem given a variety of potential environmental conditions this feature of aienabled systems sometimes can be problematic however if the behavior of the system falls outside the bounds of the kinds of actions that the human user may expect or desirethe problem of unpredictable behavior can occur even in systems that do not use machine learning for example in 2012 the financial trading firm knight capital group was wiped out by a financial glitch that led their algorithms to execute 4 million erroneous trades in 45 minutes resulting in a 460 million loss33 this happened even though knight capital group’s automated trading algorithms were relatively simple compared to today’s cuttingedge ai methods better testing and evaluation of ai systems in realistic environments can help identify these behaviors in advance but this challenge is likely to remain a risk for complex autonomous systems interacting with realworld environmentssome ai methods make it difficult even after the fact to explain the causes of their behavior the behavior of rulebased systems is generally understandable at least afterward because a given behavior can be traced back to a particular rule or interaction of rules for learning systems the ai system’s behavior depends on its prior experiences or training data the information that deep neural networks use to identify images is encoded within the strength of connections within the network for example not a set of explainable rules an ai image recognition system may be able to correctly identify an image of a school bus but not be able to explain which features of the image cause it to conclude that the picture is a bus this “black box” nature of ai systems may create challenges for some applications for instance it may not be enough for a medical diagnostics ai to arrive at a diagnosis doctors are likely to also want to know which indicators the ai is using to do so research into more explainable ai methods is thus critical to expanding potential applications for ai systems34machine learning techniques are powerful but have a number of potential safety problems that can arise from failures at any stage of the learning process learning systems can generate flawed outcomes if their goal or objective function is improperly specified this can happen in two possible ways one way is if the goal does not take into account some important factors and therefore pursuit of the goal results in some negative side effect or harm in their paper “concrete problems in ai safety” dario amodei a research scientist at openai and other ai researchers give the thought experiment of a cleaning robot that inadvertently damages the environment by knocking over a vase because it was not programmed to avoid doing so35an uber selfdriving car navigates the streets of san francisco in 2017 driving is challenging for ai systems because it takes place in an unstructured environment national security applications of ai often have an additional layer of complexity since adversaries are trying to hack spoof or manipulate ai systemsin a realworld example independent researchers have claimed that youtube’s algorithm for recommending additional videos pushes viewers to extremist content these researchers hypothesize that the algorithm is designed to maximize viewer time spent on youtube and that the algorithm learned that more inflammatory content kept viewers watching longer if true this would be an example of the pursuit of a goal maximize ad revenue having an unintended negative side effect increasing exposure to extremist content36a second way in which an improperly specified goal can cause problems is if the algorithm engages in reward hacking this is when the machine learns a behavior that technically meets its goal but is not what the designer intended the system has therefore “hacked” its reward function to the human observer this often looks like the ai system is finding a loophole to meet the letter of its goal but not the intent in a comprehensive survey from 50 ai researchers on “the surprising creativity of digital evolution” the authors noteit is often functionally simpler for evolution to exploit loopholes in the quantitative measure than it is to achieve the actual desired outcome … we often ascribe creativity to lawyers who find subtle legal loopholes and digital evolution is often frustratingly adept at similar trickery37examples of reward hacking abound from reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms in games and other digital simulation environments just a few examples includethese safety problems raise questions about potential national security applications of machine learning for example a cybersecurity system tasked with defending networks against malware could learn that humans are a major source of introducing malware and lock them out negative side effect or it could simply take a computer offline to prevent any future malware from being introduced reward hacking while these steps might technically achieve the system’s goals they would not be what the designers intendedeven if a system is properly trained on an initial set of data if the actual environment changes the system may not be able to adequately adaptsafety problems can also arise from the data machines use to learn ai systems can suffer from the same challenges of overfitting as statistical models in general data overfitting is when an ai system learns to mimic the training data precisely rather than the underlying concepts the training data represents so the system fails when applied outside of the training data another problem is ensuring robustness to changes in the input data even if a system is properly trained on an initial set of data if the actual environment changes the system may not be able to adequately adapt this can be a common problem if the data used to train a learning system does not adequately represent the data that it will face in the real world in one realworld example parents posted a video of the voiceactivated home computer device alexa searching for adult content after hearing a toddler request a children’s song43 a more robust set of training data that included small children who may not pronounce words as clearly as adults might have prevented this particular example but this is a general problem for learning systems shifting from training datasets to interactions in the real worldbias – a deviation from a standard – can arise in ai systems in a variety of ways bias is not always problematic but can be in some cases one way an ai system can exhibit bias is if the objective function or goal mirrors a bias explicit or implicit on the part of the designers if the ai system’s objective accurately reflects the values of its designers then in one sense it is a welldesigned system but if those goals are not socially desirable then there could be harmful consequences to using the system for example a selfdriving car that was programmed to always obey the speed limit even if it might be safer in some settings to drive above the speed limit with the flow of traffic would exhibit a bias toward compliance with the law over passenger safetyanother way that an ai system can exhibit bias is if the training data is biased in some way some forms of bias could have moral connotations if for example the data captures the biases of the people who collected assembled or chose the data in other cases the training data could be biased in a more technical sense with the training data not being a representative sample of the actual operating environment for example a chessplaying program that was trained on human moves might have a bias toward playing in ways that are cognitively easier for humans this bias could be valuable if the intent of the chess program is to mimic a human player if the intent is to play the best possible game of chess however then this bias could be harmfula reinforcement learning system playing a boat racing game developed a strategy of circling autorenewing targets to maximize its score rather than attempting to win the racebias could be a concern for national security applications where the training data deviates from the actual operating environment for example it is difficult for militaries to realistically simulate actual war this introduces the potential for systems to be biased and potentially in a way that militaries do not discover until combat the fog and friction of real war mean that there are a number of situations in any battle that it would be difficult to train an ai to anticipate thus in an actual battle there could be significant risk of an errorai is also vulnerable to system failures stemming from complex interaction among elements of a system system accidents which are possible in any sufficiently complex system are exacerbated in competitive environments where actors are not incentivized to share their algorithms with one another when ai systems are involved the interaction among different algorithms can lead to bizarre behavior sometimes at superhuman speeds in 2011 two automated pricing bots on amazon got caught in a price war and escalated the price of a biology textbook to 2369865593 plus 399 shipping44 more consequential examples of this phenomenon are stock trading flash crashes which remain a persistent problem across multiple financial markets financial regulators have mitigated the consequences of these flash crashes by installing “circuit breakers” that take stocks offline if the price moves too quickly these automated circuit breakers allow financial regulators to monitor individual stock prices – and react within seconds – at a scale that would not be feasible for humans flash crashes continue to occur however with over 1200 circuit breakers tripped across multiple markets in one day in 201545in national security settings unintended interactions could occur by ai systems trying to gain a competitive advantage on one another and taking actions that could be destructive or counterproductivein national security settings unintended interactions could occur by ai systems trying to gain a competitive advantage on one another and taking actions that could be destructive or counterproductive in settings where machines interact at superhuman speeds such as in cyberspace or electronic warfare these interactions could lead to harmful consequences before humans users can adequately respondeven when ai systems work perfectly accidents can still occur if the user does not fully understand the system’s limitations or the feedback that it gives when these accidents occur observers frequently blame the human user but the true cause is a breakdown between human and machine examples include the 2009 air france 447 crash which killed all passengers onboard46 and the 2016 crash of a tesla on autopilot which killed the driver47 in these cases the human operators of highly complex automated systems failed to understand the information the system was giving them leading to tragic consequences this is a particular challenge for national security applications in which the user of the system might be a different individual than its designer and therefore may not fully understand the signals the system is sending this could be the case in a wide range of national security settings such as the military border security transportation security law enforcement and other applications where the system’s designer is not likely to be either the person who decides to field the system or the endusermalicious actors who deliberately seek to subvert ai systems can potentially manipulate these ai safety problems creating a new category of risks financial traders have exploited the behavior of trading algorithms to artificially manipulate stock prices48 similarly adversaries could learn how ai systems behave and exploit their weaknesses malicious actors could also subvert learning systems by poisoning their data during the learning process so that they learn incorrect behavior this could be done by gaining access to the training data and manipulating it in subtle ways to create behavioral flaws once the system is trained alternatively for learning systems that interact with the real world adversaries could feed the system data that causes it to learn incorrect behaviors the microsoft chatbot tay learned to parrot racist and antisemitic language after less than 24 hours on twitter49these vulnerabilities present significant challenges for artificial intelligence in national security applications which often have high consequences for failure50 these problems are amplified in an inherently adversarial context in which both state and nonstate actors will seek to exploit weaknesses in ai systems and manipulate their behaviorthese safety problems which apply to a broad range of ai and machine learning techniques are compounded by the vulnerability of deep neural networks to false data inputs spoofing attacks neural networks that normally perform well at object classification tasks such as image recognition can be fooled by adversarial data adversarial inputs from a malicious actor which to humans often look like random noise or nonsense images can fool neural networks into believing the images are something else – and with high confidence51 these “fooling images” can even be embedded into other images in a way that is undetectable to humans these attacks which use specially generated adversarial data can succeed even if the attackers do not have access to the training data or source code of the targeted neural network52 in such a case a local model is trained based on the observed behavior of the neural network such as classifying a particular image then adversarial data that is inserted posttraining to fool the local model is used to attack the original neural network these fooling images can even be embedded into physical objects in one demonstration causing an image classifier to misidentify a 3dprinted turtle as a riflemalicious actors who deliberately seek to subvert ai systems can potentially manipulate these ai safety problems creating a new category of risksdespite significant research on the adversarial data problem ai researchers do not yet have a workable solution to protect against this form of attack because of this vulnerability image recognition systems could be fooled by counterai camouflage causing the image recognition system to misidentify objects adversaries could make a tank look like a school bus and vice versa even worse these patterns could be hidden in a way that is undetectable by humans decoy objects could be scattered around the environment confusing neural network–based sensors and valid targets could be covered with camouflage designed to make them appear innocuous ai researchers have demonstrated the ability to do this relatively easily – for example making a stop sign appear to an image classifier to be a 45 mile per hour sign simply by adding some small black and white stickers this form of passive environmental hacking could be done well in advance of an ai system scanning an environment like a cognitive land mine waiting to fool a system when it arrives neural network–based data classifiers are likely too valuable to ignore so national security decisionmakers will need to factor in these vulnerabilities when using ai whether for image recognition or other activitiesit may be tempting to assume that responsible actors will not employ ai and machine learning systems until these vulnerabilities are solved but that is not likely to be the case computers are vulnerable to hacking yet that has not stopped their use across society and in national security settings even when data breaches have had serious consequences53specially evolved “fooling images” can be fed into aibased image classifiers to trick them into misidentifying images with high confidence a neural network–based image classifier identified all of the above images as the associated labels with greater than 99 percent confidence see endnote 54the advantages of using computer network technology are too great to ignore and ai systems are similarly attractive ai systems are powerful and have many benefits but are vulnerable to hacking that exploits weaknesses in how they learn process data and make decisions these risks are heightened in national security settings which are often adversarial high consequence and difficult to replicate in training environments policymakers must be aware of these risks and seek to mitigate against these vulnerabilities as much as possible in the design and use of ai systemsthe field of ai and machine learning has advanced dramatically in only the past few years and continues to move forward in leaps and bounds the future of ai is highly uncertain one key variable is progress toward creating more generalpurpose ai systems that could exhibit intelligent behaviors across multiple domains unlike today’s narrow ai systems another significant variable is progress on unsolved safety problems and vulnerabilities in ai systems a world where ai performance outpaces safety could be quite hazardous if nations race to put into the field ai systems that are subject to accidents or subversion eg spoofing attacks on the other hand progress in ai safety could mitigate some of the risks that stem from national security uses of ai much of the innovation in the field of artificial intelligence is being driven by the commercial sector but governments do have the ability to influence the direction of progress through research investments the us government should increase its investment in ai safety to improve the prospects for building robust reliable and explainable ai systems in national security settingsthis report is part of the center for a new american security’s series on artificial intelligence and international

applicationspreparing to counter the malicious uses of aidata classification – ai systems can be used to help classify data from images to song genres to medical imagery and diagnosis27 in many cases ai systems can classify data more reliably and accurately than humans anomaly detection – ai systems can help detect anomalous behavior such as fraudulent financial transactions or new malware28 ai systems can find anomalies whose signatures are not yet known by analyzing routine patterns of behavior financial cyber or other and then identifying new behavior that is outside the norm these systems can be used to monitor large data streams at scale and in real time in ways that would not be feasible for humansprediction – by finding patterns across large sets of data ai systems can make statistical predictions about future behavior systems of this type are already in routine commercial use such as search engine autofills and netflix and amazon recommendations machine learning has also demonstrated value in improving weather forecasting29 some applications raise thorny ethical issues such as using ai for predictive policing or estimating longevity of medical patients in endoflife care30 optimization – ai systems can be used to optimize performance for complex systems and tasks for example deepmind used machine learning to optimize google data centers to improve energy efficiency resulting in a 40 percent savings in the amount of energy needed for cooling and a 15 percent overall improvement in energy efficiency31embedded expertise – automation allows lesserskilled individuals to perform tasks at or near the same level as higherskilled workers by embedding expertise within the machine for example individuals can use tax preparation software to do their taxes with the computer performing many of the tasks normally performed by an accountant this can lower the barrier to entry for humans to perform certain tasks larger scale operations – because software can be replicated at close to zero cost automation allows the deployment of expertise at large scales tasks that normally could be done by humans but only at small scales can become feasible at larger scales with automation examples including automated spear phishing for cyber attacks targeting advertising and sales to certain groups and automated bug finding for discovering cyber vulnerabilities in software fasterthanhuman reaction times – automation can perform tasks at superhuman speeds reacting to events far more quickly than would be possible for humans this is already the case today for highfrequency stock trading which occurs in milliseconds and automatic braking in automobiles superhuman precision and reliability – automation can be used to perform many tasks with precision and reliability that surpasses human performance the x47b experimental drone demonstrated a degree of precision in its landings that would be impossible for humans to match robotassisted surgery is used to perform miniaturized highprecision surgery that is not possible with human hands superhuman patience and vigilance – automated systems can monitor data without tiring or losing attention keeping a vigilant eye on nuclear power plants or observing computer network activity for malware signatures operations without connections to humans – autonomy enables robotic systems to perform missions independently without reliable communications to humans in some cases this could be for long periods of time such as autonomous underwater gliders that operate at sea for months at a time performing oceanographic surveys32a tetrisplaying bot learned to pause the game before the last brick fell so that it would never lose38 simulated digital creatures evolved clever ways of falling

cryptocurrency ponzi scheme that defrauded 56000 people of more than 187 millionthe fraudsters targeted people who had little to no idea of how cryptocurrency worked and lured them in with juicy bonuses and free cryptocurrency the korea joongang daily reportsfollowing the arrest of 12 people behind the scam the seoul special judicial police bureau for public safety revealed that the vast majority of the fraudulent scheme’s victims were elderly people between the ages of 60 and 70 years the ceos of the ponzi scheme identified only as lee and bae were arrested after the agency created an ai to track keywords related to ponzi schemes and internet fraudexplaining how the ai works hong namki section chief of the bureau’s second investigation team saidthrough keywords such as ponzi loan and recruiting members we were able to teach the ai patterns of ponzi schemes the program can also identify advertisement patterns and identified the enterprise in question which was caught with evidence provided by an unnamed informantthe ponzi scheme which started in may 2018 had about 201 offices that it operated from offering huge incentives to managers and members who brought in other people to join in a classic pyramid scheme format lee and bae made the bulk of their money from selling an unlisted cryptocurrency called mcoin at 087 per token promising members that the fake crypto would rise as high as 52 representing a profit of about 600 percentthe ‘mcoin’ scam targeted naive koreans with promises of heightened rewards source shutterstockthe pyramid scheme also pulled in funds through membership fees which ranged from 287 to as high as 863 for premium membership which purportedly included discounts on funerals lodgings and weddings the scheme’s promoters also promised cash incentives up to 100 for every new member introduced to the network by a downlineunlike typically flashy and visible ponzi scheme promoters lee and bae stayed under the radar keeping a tight lid on any information about the scheme’s cashflow and members according to the agency they went as far as hiding all of their accounting information on a server in japan and moving to a private house when they found out that the police were on to them to all intents and purposes the founders intended to keep it running for as long as possible in a departure from the typical slashandrun approach of crypto scammersthe elaborate scheme even had a membersonly shopping website designed to make it more convincing to potential victims as well as a crypto exchange based in the trendy gangnam district of seoulthis case may well mark a watershed in the ongoing global backandforth surrounding cryptocurrency regulation several governments have been introduced to cryptocurrency adoption through the unfortunate means of crypto ponzi schemes which has negatively colored their impression of the technology india for example continues to project a broadly hostile regulatory stance on cryptocurrency following the damaging outcomes of several indian crypto scams like bitconnectfor these countries which are often led by barely competent and often overstretched governments the added danger of financial collapse presented by the widespread adoption of cryptocurrency scams makes them firewall any attempt o create regulation aimed at helping adoption the reasoning is that it is much easier and cheaper to simply issue a blanket ban or refuse to officially acknowledge crypto than to embrace it and deal with the cost implication of creating new crimefighting and law enforcement organizations to deal with a new type of threatthe successful use of ai to fish out crypto scams however could significantly alter this picture if the technology becomes widely available it would mean that such governments no longer need to detail overstretched law enforcement resources to deal with an added threat which greatly reduces the potential cost of crypto adoptioni am a busy writer

in logistics artificial intelligence in payment artificial intelligence in manufacturing artificial intelligence in legalartificial intelligence ai may look like something out of the pages of a scifi book yet you’d be surprised how often you use it daily as the technology continues to improve ai will become even more common with more widespread utilization among diverse industries to start with let’s begin with the basic definition of artificial intelligence ai and what it includesseeking alpha gives a very apt description of the same in their article at a basic level artificial intelligence is the concept of machines accomplishing tasks which have historically required human intelligence ai can be broken down into two distinct fieldsapplied ai machines designed to complete very specifics tasks like navigating a vehicle trading stocks or playing chess – as ibm’s deep blue demonstrated in 1996 when it defeated chess grand master gerry kasparovgeneral ai machines designed to complete any task which would normally require human intervention the broad nature of general ai requires machines to “learn” as they encounter new tasks or situations this need for a learned approach is what gave rise to modern machine learning”let’s take a look at some of the most powerful artificial intelligence use cases across various industry verticals that are in use today with an eye towards revealing the competitive advantage of aiacross industries that have been gold mines for ai investments automated threat intelligence automated customer services agent and fraud detection are the biggestas per jessica goepfert program director customer insights and analysis at idc “nearterm opportunities for cognitive systems are in industries such as banking securities and investments and manufacturing…in these segments we find a wealth of unstructured data a desire to harness insights from this information and an openness to innovative technologies”fintech has witnessed a staggering growth in investments world over with the growth of over 10 to a whopping 232 billion us and china leading the market this boost is powered by growing capabilities of ai and machine learning as ai has already achieved much in retail healthcare trading etc – it is safe to say that ai will achieve great things in financea study by oxford university state that robots will replace approximately 47 of us jobs in the next 1020 years the goal however is not to put american workers out of work but about the improved efficiency that having a robot doing clinical work brings in therefore a skilled employee can focus on a more important taskby eliminating monotonous tasks that take way too much time from an employee’s day organizations can better use their employee’s time and skills for more important tasks along with giving employees the opportunity to work on more important tasks artificial intelligence also offers elimination of error in tasks which is often associated with manual and repetitive taskspoor customer service seems to be one of the main complains by customers regardless of the industry ironically customers seem to be frustrated with not being able to talk to a human and stuck with an automated systemmachine learning application though has the ability to learn an individual user’s requirements by examining their account activity and assisting the customer with a better product selection offered by bfsi companiessophisticated language parsing enables today’s ai chatbots and virtual agents to provide more realistic texttovoice systems that provide realvalue making the phone chat systems customer friendly this provides companies a costefficient solution for customer service issueswells fargo the american international american international banking and financial company uses a chatbot for assisting its customers in doing small tasks like taking their account information and helping them reset their passwords“ai technology allows us to take an experience that would have required our customers to navigate through several pages on our website and turn it into a simple conversation in a chat environment that’s a huge timesaving convenience for busy customers who are already frequent users of messenger” commented steve ellis head of wells fargo’s innovation groupother than customer engagement chatbots are also used by investment service companies as stock market assistants to enable users to stay on top of the market with realtime information on stock prices and other insights like news of diverse candidate companies to assist them in investment decisionsfor eg intelegain powered moneypotin a virtual stock simulation platform is test driving a cognitive intelligence bot using microsoft bot framework to provide realtime assistant services to help investors with investment options in the equity marketsmany financial institutions are investing in new technologies like ai and big data to improve security standards since financial institutions handle sensitive information and investments of thousands of people security is always a prioritywith more cyberattacks happening than ever upgraded banking cybersecurity software will be critical in the coming year in order to protect customers banks from hackersin a similar manner fraud detection is also on ai agenda perpetrators of fraud are smart and produce paper trails that look legitimate in the eyes of a human ai however can assist in detecting something that humans cannot through ai financial entities can detect suspicious entities investigate them thus potentially preventing thousands of expensive fraudulent transactions copycats are common in frauds this is where machine learning can offer a powerful means of preventing fraudulent activities in the futurejpmorgan chase introduced a contract intelligence coin platform developed to “analyze legal documents and extract important data points and clauses” manual reviews of 12000 annual commercial credit agreements which used to take near 360000 hours now take only secondsthe company also implemented emerging opportunities engine in 2015 which uses automated analysis in order to assist in “identifying clients best positioned for followon equity offerings”trading algorithms are already used successfully in world’s markets recognizing the staggering speed with which computer systems have transformed stock trading even though automation rules the trading world the most complex algorithms use basic ai reasoningmachine learning is poised to change the tradition by putting emphasis on making the decision more harddata based and lesser grounded on trading theorieswhile humans will always play a role in regulation and for making the final decisions more and more financial transactions are making their way to computer systems plus given the competitive nature of this field investment in ai and machine learning will be one of the most defining aspects of the field luckily these technologies have the potential to stabilize and not disrupt the financial industry therefore resulting in better job stability even reducing the probability of market crashesaidyia limited was founded in hong kong in october 2011 built to “deploy advanced artificial intelligence technology to identify patterns and predict price movements in financial markets”while computers are excellent at collecting storing data the costefficient storage equals to financial organizations storing more than ever before making sense of this information however is difficult as humans cannot rationalize big data setsai especially when assisted by a machine learning is adept at detecting small signals within large data sets this data can be crucial in fields that are competitive as the finance industryukbased arria has developed an nlg software natural language generation that is being utilized across a range of industries to “humanize” and simplify the process of analyzing dataheavy reportsarria’s cto robert dale states “by emulating human behavior in software you get technology that can carry out tasks that are more than just straightforward number crunching with the machine exhibiting real intelligence…but you get all the benefits of this being done by software it’s incredibly fast it’s incredibly consistent and it doesn’t need to sleep or take vacations so it’s available 247”ai is going to have a significant influence on data science use cases in banking same as it is going to affect finance healthcare and pharmaceuticals as most organizations have recognized the importance of big data there is an unmet need for data scientists – an issue that ai can sort out one of the best application of ai as of now is to perform the menial work of data analysis that may be number crunching finding flaws in investment strategies or a chatbot answering customer’s queries – it is the economic solution to make everything run smoother faster and at a lower costthe market size of ai software is expected to reach up to 36 million by 2025 the opportunities this presents have caused retailers to pay attention to ai thus more and more retailers big and small are applying ai tools in new ways across the entire product and service cycle right from the assembling stage to the postsale customer service interactions as ai evolves further the customer experience will only get better and so will improved outcomes through sales and customer experiences some of the examples of creative ai applications in different areas of retail are envisioned below“personalization at scale is the holy grail…by adding elements of personality insights or sentiment touchpoints like email and web personalization can become contextually aware and can build on previous customer interactions” says corinne sklar chief marketing officer at ibm consultancy bluewolfretailers are doing everything in their capacity to provide a happy shopping experience to customers this includes constantly improving on personalization however it all boils down to enhancing the overall customer experiencekaren katz president ceo of neiman marcus group rightly puts this in perspective“great customer experience in the future will come from blending technology with a more personalized touch i think the people that can combine technologypowered personalization with a human will be the winners”north face the outdoor clothing company adopted ibm watson cognitive technology in order to help customers determine what jacket may be the best option for them it bases its answers on gender preference location month activity etc for eg – hiking in canada in december will yield different results than commuting in traveling in ireland in februaryanother ai application that is finding increasing popularity is the conversational assistant whether it is through smart speakers email messaging platforms – marketers are leveraging new tools to have conversations with customers to build stronger relationships with customers brands are delivering hyperpersonalized content and product recommendation through virtual assistants chatbots etcfurthermore applications like chatbot and virtual assistants provide “relevance” ie offer the right message to the relevant customer at the right time – a key part of building sales customer relationships all the while minimizing marketing wastechris mccann ceo president of 1800flowerscom one of the first retailers to launch an alexa skill comments about possibilities ai could bring in retail “with voice as the main interface emerging i think it will bring us back to the retail experience of our first flower shop where we delivered a true 1to1 relationship voice enables us to have a 1to1 relationship with customers on a massive scale”ll bean makes use of a chatbot which asks visitors if they would like to login into their loyalty account this chatbot which is “loyalty aware” links to the customer’s loyalty points and crm data to personalize customer’s choices the interactions between the bot and user are also recorded and saved back to the crm systemmany retailers are using video analytics to improve customer service security and compliance with employee procedures retailers need a system where they can examine customer behavior in ‘bricknmortar’ stores just like they use behavior tracking for online purchasesartificial intelligence can help retailers understand inperson shoppers data generated by retail observation can determine the customers’ product’s exposure level engagement their navigational route through the store this information can help retailers improve store layout in order to influence maximum exposure and increase the customer’s visit timesephora the french cosmetics brand with retail stores of beauty products adopted video analytics technology that examined the digital video stream from the store cameras and counted the people visiting the store insights are gained from various reports statistics footfalls periodic trends peaks and valleys help them prompt towards more successful strategiesbrands are utilizing image recognition to understand customers’ preferences and recommend products that suit them the most for eg pinterest uses image recognition technology to look at an image and recommend similar content in the context of retail this capability enables brands to provide the customers’ access to their own digital “personal shopper”“the use of artificial intelligence ai and particularly visual recognition will continue momentum in opening up new and exciting sales opportunities for retailers for example visual search for products will grow particularly via mobile and the monetization of ecommerce imagery via automated product tagging will bring new revenue streams in the future” – alex vaidya ceo cofounder storystreamikea uses image recognition technology to enable customers to take photos of images in the company catalog to retrieve useful information about the specific productswap patterns colors and even see how the final product would look like in homeswhile the uptake of ai in the retail sector looks promising it is noted that applications that have the highest likelihood of adoption are those that have the most possibility of a direct return on investment most companies therefore are going to be very critical safe and bottomline focused when it comes ai adoption future ai innovations will be dictated by retail ai use cases that have already proven to be most effective overall ai involvement in the retail sector for a long term seems inevitable consideration must be given to the impact of ai on the business to make sure that employees and customers are all on board thus to successfully implement ai a balance must be maintained in between greater automation and an equal emphasis on skill development for employees and people engagement for customersai can redesign and improve healthcare in multiple ways for eg it can assist medical professionals in designing treatment plans and finding the most suitable treatment method that is the best for the particular patient it can help in carrying out tasks that are monotonous so that physicians can concentrate on their core jobsthere are already few great examples of ai in healthcare which show great potential mining medical records are one of those evident applications of ai in healthcaredata management is one of foremost potentialshowing ai application in healthcare the first step towards revolutionizing the existing healthcare systems is to collect it store it normalize it and trace its lineage it contains developing a natural language processing technology to automatically extract data from narrative medical recordsgoogle deepmind health is used to mine medical records in order to offer better and faster health services it is able to process hundreds of thousands of medical information within a matter of minutes although machine learning and dataharvesting are at its initial stage at the moment google in coordination with moorfields eye hospital nhs foundation trust is striving to improve eye treatmentai can help in carrying out repetitive tasks which take away medical professional’s time from their core jobs tasks such as xray scans ct scans analyzing tests and data entry etc can be done faster and more accurately by robots radiology and cardiology are two such disciplines where the amount of data for analyzing can be timeconsuming and overwhelming and timeexhaustingibm medical sieve is an ambitious longterm exploratory project which plans to build the nextgeneration “cognitive assistant” which is capable of analytics and reasoning with a vast range of clinical knowledge medical sieve can help in making the clinical decision regarding cardiology and radiology – a “cognitive health assistant” in other terms it is able to analyze the radiology images to detect problems reliably and speedilyai chatbots use natural language processing to understand the user’s demands followed by knowledge management to offer an answer further it uses deep learning to improve its response to each interaction sentiment analysis identifies the user’s issue and then transfers them to a human in the context of healthcare chatbots can fulfill various objectives like diagnosing the patient using the information given on symptomsyourmd – this chatbot uses artificial intelligence technology to guide the user with most relevant information for better health and life it provides the most accurate and simplest to understand medical informationnuance communications virtual assistant platform enables conversational dialogue and prebuilt capabilities that automate clinical workflows the healthcare virtual assistant employs voice recognition ehr integrations and strategic health it relationships voice biometrics texttospeech and prototype smart speaker customized for a secure platformai systems have been designed to analyze data reports and notes from a patient’s file clinical expertise and external research in order to assist in selecting the correct individually customized treatment pathibm watson provides clinicians evidencebased treatment options watson for oncology has an advanced ability to analyze the meaning and context of structured and unstructured data in clinical notes and reports that may be critical to selecting a treatment pathway the program ultimately identifies most potential treatment plans for a patient integrating notes on patient’s life research and clinical expertisedevelopment of pharmaceuticals via clinical trials can take more than a decade and cost a lot therefore making the process speedier and cheaper is one of the main objectives ai startups are aiming foratomwise amongst the recent ebola scare an ai powered program for scanning existing medicines that could be redesigned to fight diseases was utilized the technology found two drugs that may significantly decrease ebola infectivity this analysis which would have otherwise taken monthsyears was completed within 24 hours this efficiency in drug creation has the potential to save thousands of liveseven with big advancements of ai application in healthcare over the recent years it is unlikely that technology will replace the diagnostic role of physicians at least in the near future ai however is now sophisticated enough to take over the tedious repetitive tasks that used take up the productive hours of a physician the potential ai holds in healthcare is endless with professionals exploring the application of ai in areas like insurance verification skin cancer diagnosis medical record data analysis etc we are just beginning to realize the true depth of healthtech innovation that can be unlocked with ai technologyai essentially processes a huge amount of data and then puts it to use currently there is so much data involved in logistics chain that it is difficult to comprehend it all without the assistance of ai with the application of algorithms the processor is able to examine and store the data and then act respond and intervene accordinglyai also has the capability of analyzing past data and learn from it to enable businesses with better recommendations using predictive analyticsone of the possibilities that ai can realize in logistics is that of increased automation for eg aipowered robots used to automatically restock empty warehouse but also predict when they will run low even if this might be way off for most one advantage of all the data analysis is the realtime information gained as well as complete visibility of warehouse stockin fact carousel the leading provider of personalized logistics predicts that one of the biggest growth areas where the artificial technology will make noteworthy difference to the bottom line is the intelligent forecast systems and in providing valueadded services more easily at a costefficient rateanticipatory logistics are grounded on predictive algorithms running on big data this permits logistics professionals to improve efficiency and quality by estimating demand in advance before the customer places an orderthe foremost influencer for anticipatory logistics is the customer’s lack of patience with long delivery times customers always want their online shopping experience to be matched with the convenience of fast deliveryin this area anticipatory logistics benefits all parties involved in the supply line – by anticipating demand permitting businesses to spike up their resources before the demand shoots upfor eg ai predicting that consumer demand for the latest mobile device model is going to rise – the manufacturer then will increase the production of that particular model accordingly this will in turn inform the trucking companies in advance of how much transportation capability is needed to deliver all the mobile devices and when date the retailer will know to order adequate stock – to increase advertising efforts and display space on the store shelves and in general prepare for a boom in online shoppinganticipatory logistics also serve well on the supply chain risk management front ai tools predict maintenance needs and probable risks quite similar to transportationdisruption management predictions manufacturing and transportation industries utilize ai technology to vehicle and factory maintenance in such a case predictive maintenance is based on the sensor data gathered from smart machines and vehiclesfor eg konux a munichbased iiot company – integrates smart sensor systems with aibased analytics in order to monitor infrastructure and other assets’ condition and thus enable predictive maintenance one of their solutions includes switch monitoring which assists rail operators in monitoring and examination of switch health the system helps observe the progressing mechanical wear of switches and detect anomalies in time this prevents railroad switch errors“machine learning uses massive computing power to recognize patterns in data that humans could never see and then learns from every new piece of data it receives to get smarter and more accurate in real time” says joccommachine learning ml or rather selflearning is a very familiar concept in industries like digital pattern detection ediscovery and sensor data analytics even if the logistics industries have been particularly slow in the uptake of machine learning other logistics intuitive companies are adopting selflearning systemsmachine learning leverages data across multiple systems and data sets in the context of logistics – the system combines all the data in the carrier network with outside data sources like gps systems historical pricing performance and federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa to assist shippers more accurately estimate demand examine trends in supply chains track daily patterns within lanes and monitor seasonal calendarspopular usage of ml and logistics are decoding ineligible handwritten text often found on the envelopes in fact post offices are already making use of these selfserving learning logistics as are the big shipping companies like fedex and upsa newer selflearning system that has been introduced is that of ‘intelligent warehouse management system’ like the panasonic iws the company introduces the intelligent warehouse system panasonic iws as “a complete solution which includes surveillance cameras data network video recording tracking software and your existing xray scanning technology”these systems detect the trends and incidents examine the data and connect the insights gained to specific entities like orders or customers and launch prepack instructionsnlp is a form of machine learning which is dramatically improving the efficiency of supply chains by speeding up the data entry process and autopopulating form fieldsnlp integration with transportation management system tms and email text chat and voice communication the nlp systems observe and learn from these exchanges after enough data feed the system recognizes the behavior of particular users and begins to anticipate the users’ need by autopopulating the bill of lading shipping orders and other transactions saving the shipper’s timechatbots in logistics can provide better customer engagement for eg rather than going to the website of the logistics service provider to find the details of their consignment and feed the specific code a complex combo of numbers and alphabets all the customer will need to do need to do is open a simple chat window for the solutionnatural disasters union strikes highway closures etc there are many incidences that can disrupt shipping schedules this can cause a ripple effect and affect the entire supply chain thus disruption management can avoid or at least alleviate disruptions by feeding data from the union activities national weather service and transportation board law enforcement etcml allows the users to train the ai engine with diverse contingency plans allowing it to suggest possible solutions for likely disruption amadeus provides a disruption management solution which manages passenger reaccommodation for one or multiple flightsnamed as amadeus passenger recovery once the scheduled event is received it “proposes an optimal passenger recovery plan rebooks services reissues tickets and emds transfers bags and checks passengers onto their new flight this process takes into account realtime flight availability within the airline’s network and beyond airline policies and passenger prioritization”machines learning models price predictions which is quite similar to automated stock trading software the system takes account of historical pricing data for a variety of routes goods and delivery schedules then it crossreferences them with the traffic weather and then estimates the fairest priceai analytics can track individual suppliers and report what type of cargo the transportation company carries and how much they charge the broker filters the results in order to crossreference the supplier types for eg a moving company who deal with dangerous materials crossreferences with cargo security accident reports and priceswhile the broker may maintain personal relationships with suppliers the ai tool enables the organization to smartly manage the supplier inventory rather than relying completely on the relationships or past historyai has aroused interest not only because of its ability to increase efficiency and service customers at a lower cost but also due to its potential to create more agile business models – that are scalable and flexible to the continuously changing market needs up until now logistic professionals had to rely on predictions which were sometimes outdated on inventory levels and static sales information rather than live data issues like these have been solved by ai which enables professionals to get the precise information of what is going on – thus discontinuing the dependency on guesstimations ai offers great possibilities for efficiencies while customers too can enjoy fast delivery reliable stock information timesaving and overall a great user experience with aipowered logistics and supply chain managementone of the most discussed technologies that have made a huge impact on finance industry as well as payment industry is artificial intelligence it can safely be said that it is capturing the interest of companies worldwidefor eg tesla facebook amazon apple and google all have already started investing actively in ai technology ai covers a wide spectrum of technologies that work in payment services“artificial intelligence is likely to transform many industries in the next decade including payments” predicts michelle evans global head of digital consumer research at euromonitor international so let’s see how if ai is making his predictions come truemachine learning ml is especially important now than ever in fraud detection as there is a significant shift to ecommerce and other remote “cards not present” transactions where fast approval is needed yet the customer’s physical card is not available for additional verificationstudies point out that such remote channels are primarily responsible for increased levels of fraud at us merchants – especially amongst larger companiesplus due to the significant change in immediate payment systems which correspond to requiring faster identification of potentially fraudulent transactions the importance of fraud detection is driven up using the machine learning’s algorithm to derive insights into which correlation of variable lead to a fraudulent paymentthe systems use rulebased logic to block the transactions that have the highest probability of being a fraud albeit professional conmen are fast at detecting when their payments are being blocked and switch to a new merchant to continue their scheme combining the forces of ml and ai historical data can be used to identify patterns associated with fraud and make quick adjustments to their algorithm’s and rulebased logic without human interferencecanadian travel agency redtagca uses distil networks which weeds out the bad bots that are fraudulently reserving a block of seats on a flight to cause the price of the remaining seats to rise dramaticallyanother example is that of the 3d secure newest version which is playing a key role in new ecommerce security product powered by ai it is an additional security layer within its ecommerce fraud prevention platform which uses ml and ai to flag down the riskiest transactions that should be challenged in order to protect merchants from chargebacks and fraudml and ai can be used to optimize payments by dealing with one of the biggest issues regarding processing cards ie authorization ratesnotwithstanding the rules and frequent compliance releases from schemes like mastercard and visa getting a payment authorized – is more difficult than it seems the merchants send their transactions to psps who send it to the acquirers who create the complete message to send it to the schemes and then they pass it the issuerthere is 1 in 5 chances that the payment gets refused it can show anything from ‘expired’ to “not honored’ as a reason for the declinethe situation remains that by using ml and ai merchants psps are able to learn from the submitted payments and estimate the success rate depending upon the category of card type transaction issuers merchant’s country and other parameters therefore by optimizing the route ie the transaction to the acquirer with the highest probability of success merchantspsp can increase their authorization rate3d secure 20 improves the authentication possibilities that enable merchants to move closer to frictionless checkout experiences for their customers with improved security and new intelligent risk based possibilitiesanother area of payment services where ai is utilized is for marketing which gets quite an attention but is not as developed as one might think many payment service providers have used ai to make predictions grounded on customer’s behavior using them to push certain products services that will help customers manage their financescrosscues uses machine learning and ai to enable their clients to understand anticipate and engage their customers equipped with data they use their neural network which is a computer system modeled off the human brain which “makes a psychographic profile of a customer advising the financial institution about what a specific customer or demographic likes and dislikes”while there’s still a long way to go before we let aibased tools and algorithms control our financial systems the fintech sector is starting to use the technologies in diverse and creative ways the crossover between ai and fintech comes at a stage where ai is creating disruptive technology for the consumer payments and digital transactions are key areas for successful integration of ai services to improve customer experience fortunately for customers major industry players in the payment industry like paypal amazon mastercard and google have their eye on ai their involvement in the revolutionary change may have a positive butterfly effect throughout the industry“with advancing adoption of ai manufacturers can leave the mundane and routine tasks to automation and free themselves up to pursue new ideas and new ways of thing making – that’s beyond the realm of machines” – infosysit is through manufacturing that we are able to transform a few pixels on display into tangible physical objects by bringing ai into the mix it is possible to deliver digital transformation to the physical world ai is furthermore well suited to addressing challenges that the manufacturing industry faces today issues like inflexible production line design variable quality and yield rising production costs inability to manage capacity can be solved with ai capabilitywith the assistance of automated quality control predictive maintenance adaptive manufacturing and more ai can develop solutions around controlling and automating visual inspection automated issue identification calibration and tuning for large scale manufacturersai can shorten design cycles optimize utilization of energy and materials remove supplychain bottlenecks improve quality control and production yields etcadaptive manufacturing compliantly produces develops and delivers demanddriven products while optimally leveraging existing resources in order for adaptive manufacturing to happen though the manufacturers must seamlessly transmit knowledge for defining scheduling and producing products in between their enterprise systems and shopfloor systemsrethink robotics a us based company that develops robots for production and research environments advocated “cobot” model in this model the humans and robots work cooperatively to produce the best results and efficiency even though industrial robots performed tedious tasks on assembly lines and heavy lifting they are generally designed with the purpose of doing single tasks and require hours to reprogram these smart collaborative robots are able to learn a multitude of tasks from demonstrations – just like human workers dopredictive analytics as its name suggests predicts the future based on the functions of the past it can calculate when maintenance is needed for cars devices trucks and drilling machines and then it can also schedule repairs and upkeep before a severe failure happenssiemens launched mindsphere in 2016 which it describes as “a smart cloud for industry – allows machine manufacturers to monitor machine fleets for service purposes throughout the world” by the end of 2016 they had also integrated ibm’s watson analytics into the tools offered by their servicethe company not unlike ge aims to monitor record and analyze everything in manufacturing from the design to delivery in order to figure out the problems and solutions that people may not even be aware of one of the many successes siemens has enjoyed with ai is the improved specific gas turbines’ emissions which has improved to a level than any human was capable of“even after experts had done their best to optimize the turbine’s nitrous oxide emissions…our ai system was able to reduce emissions by an additional ten to fifteen percent” commented norbert gaus head of research in digitalization and automation at siemens corporate technologysiemens latest gas turbines have over 500 sensors that continuously temperature pressure stress and other variables all this information is fed to their neural networkbased ai siemens claims their system is learning how to continuously adjust fuel valves to create the optimal conditions for combustion based on specific weather conditions and the current state of the equipment more combustion results in few unwanted byproductsunderestimating or overestimating consumer demand can result in lost revenues either in the form of lost sales or stagnant inventory rather than running reactively connected consumer apps and iot with industrial iot can be depended upon for real time demand visibility with the rise of smart home devices like google home and amazon echo the consumer trends and behavioral data can inform downstream supply chain and manufacturing activitieseven if there is no whole endtoend network right now at least in operation supply chain optimization organizations like elemica already combine the business processes like order management procurement transportation sourcing and inventory management in a single convenient platformanother eg is that of amazon which controls consumer touchpoint like the echo manufacturing warehouses fulfillment centers – are actively investing in order to the close the feedback loop for ondemand productiona speedier feedback loop empowers the factories to overcome low yields percentage of units that pass the quality control unplanned downtimes low productivity etcnick pinkston founder of plathora explains “issues with low yield are most acute around high complexity products — like a laptop where there are a ton of various systems that need to come together perfectly for the product to work”he furthers that productivity is not given priority against yield the faster the manufacturer pushes the process more likely he is to make mistakes and produce low quality output “better monitoring and adaptive control can allow you to increase the productivity of a single machine and likewise better overall system monitoring and planning can allow the overall system to produce more product on the same numbers of machines” he saysinstrumentalai leverages cameras powered by computer vision algorithms to triage defects in the products immediately rather than relying on humans and detect the root cause of failure doing anomaly detection on hundreds or thousands of units in seconds rather than hours enables manufacturers to identify and resolve production failures before expensive postponements heap upthe manufacturing industry is already technically advanced using automation robotics for years that is why unlike other fields where ai deployment can cause disruption the shortterm utilization of ai in manufacturing is more likely to look like evolution rather than a revolution while faster training time improved ontime deliveries a decrease in equipment failures seem small but when considered together their potential is significantmeanwhile in longterm the total digital integration and improved automation of the whole production and design process can possibly open up a range of interesting possibilities customizations are rare and expensive meanwhile massproduced goods are the longstanding model in manufacturing since presently the redesigning cost of the factory line for new products is often excessivealthough customers are willing to settle for the massproduced goods as they are cheaper if the technology for customization is cheap enough it can create a real shift in many markets so imagine instead of shoes coming in just a dozens of sizes they will come in an infinite number of sizes each order customized as per unique fitting and shipped just as quicklyone of the trendiest topics in the legal field right now is a technology with the capability of simulating human intelligence and decision making and making it faster 10 times ie the artificial intelligence ai the growing interest of ai in law is said to be slowly revolutionizing the profession and thus closing in on legal researchers paralegals and litigators etcai companies are continuing to find new ways in which ai can be applied to manage the laborious tasks in different industries for better accuracy and speed in the legal sector the technology providers are trying to streamline work processes breaking down ai’s current legal applications we come to three main categories in which ai is applied in the legal industry – ie research analytics and automating creative processes“due diligence is an investigation of a business or person prior to signing a contract or an act with a certain standard of care it can be a legal obligation but the term will more commonly apply to voluntary investigations” explains google snippetit is one of the basic tasks that lawyers do on the behalf of their clients which includes confirmation of facts and figures and thoroughly examining a legal situation the due diligence process is needed for intelligently advising clients on what their options are what action they should take etcwhile a comprehensive due diligence can have a positive effect on longterm shareholder returns the process can be timeconsuming and expensive lawyers need to conduct an allinclusive investigation for meaningful results plus lawyers are probable to make errors while performing spot checksfor eg leverton a branch of the german institute for artificial intelligence also utilizes ai technology for extraction of relevant information management of documents and for compiling leases in real estate transactions this cloudbased tool can perform the reading of contracts at the high speeds in 20 different languagesanother example of an ai technology for research purposes is ross intelligence software which helps in legal research the number of links cases and information that is present in the research can overwhelm lawyers especially if they have limited time on their hands lawyers therefore can take advantage of the natural language search capability that ross intelligence software is equipped with and ask questions receive information like for suggested readings secondary resources and related case lawsautomated contract analysis is already used by large companies as well as by an online dispute resolution system that can assist in settling many cases in a more costefficient manner compared to in the courtamiqus chief executive callum murray explains “the issue with that at the moment is access to the volume dataset” with an enormous amount of data currently behind paywalls “the ministry of justice is looking at openly publishing some court information” he adds “it’s going to take some time to change that but once that changes it’s really going to open the floodgates to an open innovation approach”many studies indicate that knowledge work automation will be the biggest disruptors in the global economy many law firms have taken advantage of this technology by automating the process of document drafting using a software like the perfect ndaneota logic system is one such law firm using the automation software perfect nda to shorten the nondisclosure agreement nda process via providing templates chosen by ai as per user’s scenario the user answers the questions through which a prefilled template is generatedplus the software also has features like document filing and integrated esignatures in order to streamline associated manual processes involved in nda draftingway back in 2004 a group of professors from washington university had tested their algorithm’s accuracy in forecasting supreme court’s decisions on a total 628 argued cases in 2002 a comparison in between their algorithms’ result versus an expert team’s findings was drawn the statistical model by the professors proved to be better at forecasting with predicting 75 of outcomes correctly compared to the 59 accuracy of expert’s teamfor eg premonition is litigation database which claims that it can predict a lawyer’s success by analyzing the lawyer’s winning rate case duration and type plus his pairing with a judge at an accuracy rate of 307 average case outcome the company says that the product can assist in looking at different cases and the duration they will take for each attorney as wellit must be remembered however like any other analytics platform that ai tools dealing with predictive technology need an enormous amount of data in the form of case documents to fully function“the model itself is exceptionally complicated it uses a total of about 95 variables with very precise weights with almost precise values up to four or five decimal places and each justice’s vote is predicted by creating about 4000 randomized decision trees” says vox of premonitionone of the biggest areas where lawyer’s expertise is needed is while securing trademarks copyrights and patents the entire intellectual property application process though can be exhaustive and arduous traditional trademark and patent search comprise of looking into hundreds if not thousands of results through manual research this is time consuming meanwhile patent applications are timesensitive“patent applications in the us must be filed within 1 year of a public disclosure or an offer for sale of the invention or the invention is barred from obtaining patent protection” explains scherrer an intellectual property law firmfor eg turbopatent’s smartshell enables paralegals in improving efficiency by automating document reviews drafting formatting and detecting problems on patent applications it uses ai and nlp natural language processing to aid in creating legal claims according to turbopatent two paralegals from the pacific patent group used smartshell to do bibliographic research examiner remarks review document retrieval and rejection issues discovery they were able to be up to 800 more productive in their tasks with only 15th of the time in comparison to their manual methods to perform the same taskselectronic billing now delivers legal billing securely from law firms and other vendors directly to the desktops of inhouse counselproviding an alternative to paper based invoicing – it offers “average savings of more than 22 in annual outside legal spending from improved bill review and 26 from budget tracking” according to the 10th edition of the annual accserengeti survey of acc members other than savings it also reduces disputes on line items proffers accurate client adjustments and accurate tracking and reporting probablythere are others though that have criticized the technology like mark herrman a leading international law firm partner writes in his article “automated systems that unthinkingly cut bills can lead to unintended consequences for example some corporate clients refuse to pay for more than ten hours of a single lawyer’s time billed in one day unless the lawyer is physically at a trial site”while the software needs to be evaluated for possible adjustments there are a few that have been using it successfullyfor eg smokeball’s cloudbased legal practice management tool claims to “automatically records your law firms time and activities” one of the major features of this tool is its ability to track all activities – which includes emails only which are valid for billing according to its website it has automated 636300 forms managed 105 million documents and 17 million emailsai’s role in law and the legal profession is a peculiar situation which is a bit of a catch 22 since enhancing improving efficiency seems to be the most acknowledged benefit of ai tools the documents processing and detecting errors is sped upthis seems to be ironic since the legal market has long since depended on “billable hours” therefore it would be unlikely for lawyers to take less time in completing a task document for this reason only eliminating menial time exhausting work will not likely be strong enough reason to drive ai adoptionhowever what is more likely to drive up ai adoption is the legal firms which will be more efficient and thus costefficient as a result of implementing ai offering low cost service to their clients thus the remaining firms which do not have ai capability will discover themselves to be overpriced in the competitionnevertheless ai is making its way in the legal market– it will most likely backup rather than displace legal professionals and it will draw it more into the legal service

tailored for youby philipp gerbert jan justus and martin heckeruntil recently artificial intelligence ai was similar to nuclear fusion in unfulfilled promise it had been around a long time but had not reached the spectacular heights foreseen in its infancy now however ai is realizing its potential in achieving humanlike capabilities so it is time to ask how can business leaders harness ai to take advantage of the specific strengths of man and machineai is swiftly becoming the foundational technology in areas as diverse as selfdriving cars and financial trading selflearning algorithms are now routinely embedded in mobile and online services researchers have leveraged massive gains in processing power and the data streaming from digital devices and connected sensors to improve ai performance and machines have essentially cracked speech and vision specifically and human communication generally the implications are profounda field that once disappointed its proponents is now striking remarkably close to home as it expands into activities commonly performed by humans see the exhibit and the sidebar ai programs for example have diagnosed specific cancers more accurately than radiologists no wonder that traditional companies in finance retail health care and other industries have started to pour billions of dollars into the fieldyou may also be interested inartificial intelligence and businessthree milestone events made the general public aware of ai each one illustrates key aspects of the technologydeep blue’s defeat of world chess champion garry kasparov in 1997 chess was originally considered an exercise that captures the essential tactical and strategic elements of human intelligence and so it became the standard by which new ai algorithms were tested for decades programmers made little progress in defeating human players but in 1997 deep blue a computer developed by ibm won the match against the world champion still many people were disappointed when they realized that solving chess was not the same as solving artificial general intelligence they did not like that deep blue relied heavily on brute force and memory the program did not learn and certainly did not excel at any task but chessthe event however revealed two important lessons first machines solve problems differently than people do second many “intelligent” tasks are ultimately narrow and so can be solved by specialized programswith alphago’s 2016 victory over lee sedol in go computer dominance of board games was complete alphago developed by deepmind technologies relied on deep learning—a neural network or computational brain with multiple layers—to beat a go world champion an intriguing fact about this match was how the machine prepared having run out of human games to study it spent the final months before the match playing against itselfwatson’s victory over top jeopardy champs in 2011 by winning this challenging game show ibm’s watson effectively passed a turing test of humanlike intelligence the performance showcased stateoftheart speech recognition naturallanguage processing and search the victory however was clinched by a different skill watson outperformed the other contestants in the “daily doubles” in which players can wager all or part of their current winnings to secure a decisive lead making the best bet requires fast sequential reasoning knowledge of game theory and an ability to calculate probabilities and outcomes correctly all these are areas in which humans are notoriously weak as the nobel laureate daniel kahneman observed in his famous book thinking fast and slow machines on the other hand think fast and fast in making dataheavy decisionsgoogle’s demonstration of a selfdriving car in 2012 google is not the pioneer of selfdriving cars that distinction arguably goes to ernst dickmanns a german computer vision expert who rode 1785 kilometers in autonomous mode on a german autobahn in 1995 reaching speeds above 175 kilometers an hourdickmanns however never had to turn left in their 2004 book the new division of labor frank levy and richard murnane argue that “executing a left turn against oncoming traffic involves so many factors that it is hard to imagine discovering the set of rules that can replicate a driver’s behavior” google’s selfdriving car however routinely managed this exercise without incident the car combined robots computer vision and realtime data processing to produce the ultimate intelligent agent that was capable of both exploring and learning from the real worldbecause ai systems think and interact they are invariably compared to people but while humans are fast at parallel processing pattern recognition and slow at sequential processing logical reasoning computers have mastered the former in narrow fields and are superfast in the latter just as submarines don’t swim machines solve problems and accomplish tasks in their own wayrelated articleswithout further quantum leaps in processing power machines will not reach artificial general intelligence agi the combination of vastly different types of problemsolving capabilities—the hallmark of human intelligence today’s robocar for example doesn’t exhibit what we would consider common sense such as abandoning an excursion to assist a child who has fallen off her bicycle but when properly applied ai excels at performing many business tasks quickly intelligently and thoroughlyartificial intelligence is no longer an elective it is critical for companies to figure out how humans and computers can play off each other’s strengths as intertwined actors to create competitive advantagein simpler times a technology tool such as walmart’s logistics tracking system in the 1980s could serve as a source of advantage ai is different the naked algorithms themselves are unlikely to provide an edge many of them are in the public domain and businesses can access opensource software platforms such as google’s tensorflow openai a nonprofit organization started by elon musk and others is making ai tools and research widely available and many prominent ai researchers have insisted on retaining the right to publish their results when joining companies such as baidu facebook and googlerather than scrap traditional sources of competitive advantage such as position and capability ai reframes them see the exhibit companies then need a fluid and dynamic view of their strengths positional advantage for example generally focuses on relatively static aspects that allow a company to win market share proprietary assets distribution networks access to customers and scale these articles of faith have to be reimagined in the ai worldrelated articleslet’s look at three examples of how ai shifts traditional notions of competitive advantagein addition to reframing specific sources of competitive advantage ai helps increase the rate and quality of decision making for specific tasks the number of inputs and the speed of processing for machines can be millions of times higher than they are for humans predictive analytics and objective data replace gut feel and experience as a central driver of many decisions stock trading online advertising and supply chain management and pricing in retail have all moved sharply in this directionto be clear humans will not become obsolete even if there will be dislocations similar to but arguably more rapid than those during the industrial revolution first you need people to build the systems uber for instance has hired hundreds of selfdriving vehicle experts about 50 of whom are from carnegie mellon university’s robotics institute and ai experts are the most indemand hires on wall street second humans can provide the common sense social skills and intuition that machines currently lack even if routine tasks are delegated to computers people will stay in the loop for a long time to ensure qualityin this new aiinspired world where the sources of advantage have been transformed strategic issues morph into organizational technological and knowledge issues and vice versa structural flexibility and agility—for both man and machine—become imperative to address the rate and degree of changescalable hardware and adaptive software provide the foundation for ai systems to take advantage of scale and flexibility one common approach is to build a central intelligence engine and decentralized semiautonomous agents tesla’s selfdriving cars for example feed data into a central unit that periodically updates the decentralized softwarewinning strategies put a premium on agility flexible employment and continual training and education aifocused companies rarely have an army of traditional employees on their payroll open innovation and contracting agreements proliferate as the chief operating officer of an innovative mobile bank admitted his biggest struggle was to transform members of his leadership team into skilled managers of both people and robotsrelated interviewlooking into the future of artificial intelligencecompanies looking to achieve a competitive edge through ai need to work through the implications of machines that can learn conduct human interactions and engage in other highlevel functions—at unmatched scale and speed they need to identify what machines do better than humans and vice versa develop complementary roles and responsibilities for each and redesign processes accordingly ai often requires for example a new structure of both centralized and decentralized activities that can be challenging to implement finally companies need to embrace the adaptive and agile ways of working and setting strategy that are common at startups and ai pioneers all companies might benefit from this approach but it is mandatory for aienabled processes which undergo constant learning and adaptation for both man and machineexecutives need to identify where ai can create the most significant and durable advantage at the highest level ai is well suited to areas with huge amounts of data such as retail and to routine tasks such as pricing but that heuristic oversimplifies the playing field increasingly all corporate activities are awash in data and capable of being broken down into simple tasks see the exhibit we advocate looking at ai through four lensesfirst define the needs of your customers ai may be a sexy field but it always makes sense to return to the basics in building a business where do your current or potential customers have explicit or implicit unmet needs even the most disruptive recent business ideas such as uber and airbnb address people’s fundamental requirementssecond incorporate technological advances the most significant developments in ai generally involve assembling and processing new sources of data and making partially autonomous decisions numerous services and platforms can capture incoming data from databases optical signals text and speech you will probably not have to build such systems yourself the same is true on the back end as a result of the increasing availability of output technologies such as digital agents and robots consider how you can use such technologies to transform your processes and offeringsthird create a holistic architecture that combines existing data with new or novel sources even if they come from outside the stack of ai services has become reasonably standardized and is increasingly accessible through intuitive tools even nonexperts can use large data setsfinally break down processes and offerings into relatively routinized and isolated elements that can be automated taking advantage of technological advances and data sources then reassemble them to better meet your customers’ needsfor many organizations these steps can be challenging to apply the four lenses systematically companies need to be familiar with the current and emerging capabilities of the technology and the required infrastructure a center for excellence can serve as a place to incubate technical and business acumen and disseminate ai expertise throughout the organization but ultimately ai belongs in and belongs to the businesses and functions that must put it to useonly when humans and machines solve problems together—and learn from each other—can the full potential of ai be achievedthe bcg henderson

navigating a world of digital disruptiondata ai’s strongest applications are datahungry pioneers in the field such as facebook google and uber have each secured a “privileged zone” by gaining access to current and future data the raw material of ai from their users and others in ways that go far beyond traditional data harvesting their scale gives them the ability to run more training data through their algorithms and thus improve performance in the race to leverage fully functional selfdriving cars for example uber has the advantage of collecting 100 million miles of fleet data daily from its drivers this data will eventually inform the company’s mobility services facebook and google take advantage of their scale and depth to hone their ad targeting not all companies can realistically aspire to be facebook google or uber but they do not need to by building accessing and leveraging shared rented or complementary data sets even if that means collaborating with competitors companies can complement their proprietary assets to create their own privileged zone sharing is not a dirty word the key is to build an unassailable and advantaged collection of open and closed data sourcescustomer access ai also changes the parameters of customer access wellplaced physical stores and hightraffic online outlets give way to customer insights generated through ai major retailers for example can run loyalty pointofsale weather and location data through their ai engines to create personalized marketing and promotion offers they can predict your route and appetite—before you are aware of them—and conveniently provide familiar complementary or entirely new purchasing options the suggestive power of many of these offers has generated fresh revenue at negligible marginal costcapabilities capabilities traditionally have been segmented into discrete sources of advantage such as knowledge skills and processes aidriven automation merges these areas in a continual cycle of execution exploration and learning as an algorithm incorporates more data the quality of its output improves similarly on the human side agile ways of working blur distinctions between traditional capabilities as crossfunctional teams build quick prototypes and improve them on the basis of fast feedback from customers and end users ai and agile are inherently iterative in both offerings and processes become continuous cycles algorithms learn from experience allowing companies to merge the broad and fast exploration of new opportunities with the exploitation of known

president and gartner fellow wrote that promises of artificial intelligence ai magically performing intellectual tasks that humans do and dynamically learning as much as humans is speculative at best however with 2018 rapidly approaching ai is clearly on the minds of many businesses where are businesses practically applying ai in their digital workplacesin october 2017 cearley noted at the gartner 2017 symposiumitxpo in orlando fl that narrow ai currently holds the most promise narrow ai is composed of highly scoped machinelearning solutions that target a specific task such as understanding language or driving a vehicle in a controlled environment with algorithms chosen that are optimized for that task he says cmswires dom nicastro spoke with several experts to find some practical use cases of artificial intelligence in the digital workplacechatbots and virtual assistants help us ask our phones and home devices questions why not bring this into the workplace setting thats the thinking behind sap copilot a digital assistant by sap designed to help businesses with tasks like purchasing contracts and collaborating with colleagues sam yen chief design officer at sap said in a video interview at sap teched barcelona they wanted to do in the enterprise what virtual assistants do for consumers questions like whats my total spend with vendor x can be asked via smartphone appsap goal is to eliminate the need for users to manually interact with multiple work apps to get a job done sap copilot does this through a virtual human robot powered by artificial intelligence speech recognition natural language processing statistical analysis and machine learning users can ask questions and give commands and sap copilot contextualizes their informal and unstructured speech analyzes it and then executes actions and presents users with business objects options and other databusiness consultancy deloitte formed a partnership with machinelearning developer kira systems to create models that intend to quickly read thousands of complex documents extracting and structuring textual information for better analysis david schatsky a managing director for deloitte who analyzes emerging technology and business trends told cmswire companies of all sizes need to review stacks of documents for one reason or another they look for risks they look at what kind of contracts they may have with suppliers or counterparties ai he said now makes it possible to do that kind of work a lot faster and more comprehensively it completely changes the way that kind of work is done he saysdavid schatskytraditionally if a company has 15000 contracts to be reviewed an auditor will try to get a representative sample for analysis with ai partnerships like deloittekira systems natural language processing and machine learning trains the application to recognize the structure of these contracts and to enable it to pick out the key clauses terms and conditions and the key points within a contract in an automated fashion so you leave behind the sort of sampling approach and you get the whole population of documents so you can get much much better insight and you can lower the risk of missing something schatsky saidschatsky also shared that its possible to experiment and keep costs relatively low deloittes playbook was not building ai engines from scratch but rather a construct based on third party technology that it customized theres some pretty lowcost points of entry to experiment there because the big cloud providers are providing basic machine learning in the cloud he saysweve all wanted to go back to a recorded call or meeting and find the important talking points without the hassle of trying to guess where something was said aisense a silicon valley startup founded last year has released technology that is designed to make voice conversations accessible and searchable through its ambient voice intelligence the company last month announced its powering transcription for the zoom video communications platform and is also working to ship a consumer product available in early 2018 it raised a 10 million series a round last monthaisense also has in beta an application that integrates with a callrecording smartphone app it takes recorded calls and using artificial intelligence transcribes those calls and curates them for users those leveraging the transcribed calls can search for keywords users can also search for terms across all their recorded callsthe integration between aisense and zoom allows for recorded meetings and transcriptionthis is as about as practical as it gets says seamus mcateer general manager of revenue and partnerships for aisense their technology includes automatic speech recognition speaker identification and separation speechandtext sync deep content search and natural language processing users can see what was said when and by who and output is shareable we believe in a world in the workplace where you can keep a record when you want of a conversation notes will go away you can focus on whats being said we think this can be disruptive in a very good way says mcateerwalkme a

infographicsnatural disasters are out of the reach and influence of human beings however a lot can be done to minimize loss of lives artificial intelligence is one viable option that can potentially prevent massive loss of lives while at the same time make rescue efforts easy and efficient to learn more checkout the infographic below created by eastern kentucky university’s online masters in safety degree programin the period between 2005 and 2015 a total of 242 natural disasters occurred in the united states of america these caused loss of human lives and massive destruction of property across the country storms registered the highest number of natural disasters with 134 recorded incidents other disasters included the following in order from the highest number to the lowest 51 flood incidents 37 fires 9 extreme temperature periods 6 droughts 4 earthquakes and 1 landslidein 2015 flood incidents were responsible for over 13 billion in property damages in the us and 32 deaths in one specific incident about 12000 americans were affected when a flood ravaged through the states of texas colorado oklahoma and arkansasfirerelated cases are responsible for over 2 billion in damages and 6 deaths in 2015 a particular wildfire that occurred in northern california affected a whopping 7302 peoplestorms caused the highest amount of damages and property destruction worth 3 billion these incidents also caused 46 deaths convective storms often travel through southern states reaching texas and new mexicoartificial intelligence can greatly help emergency and disaster management efforts not only in america but also the rest of the world today drones robots and sensors can provide intelligent and accurate information concerning landscapes and damaged buildings this allows rescue workers to understand the topography of a landscape and the extent of damage to a building drones can be used to find victims trapped in debris allowing rescue workers to get to them quicklyqatar computing research institute qcri is a free online tool developed by the qatar foundation for education science and community development the company is based in doha qatar qcri aims to increase efficiency of agencies and volunteer services during disaster management the tool utilizes machine learning to automatically identify texts and tweets that relate to particular crises1concern produces a common and comprehensive picture during emergency operations to be used by emergency operation centers its main goal is to assist these centers to allocate resources that are needed for rescue efforts the tools also prepare effective planning modules which stimulate lifelike disasters purely for training purposes these modules also determine potentially vulnerable areas that would be affected the most during a natural disaster1concern has been able to map about 163696 square miles and has covered over 39 million people so far in addition it has analyzed nearly 11 million structures and modeled an impressive 14967 fault lines this allows the program to be prepared and stay alert in case a natural disaster occursblueline grid was created and developed by bill braxton david riker and jack weiss braxton is the current police commissioner of the new york police department nypd until 2013 he served as the chief of the los angeles police department lapdblueline grid is a mobile communications platform developed to assist rescue efforts during disasters it connects all users to an established network of first responders security teams and law enforcement bodies via voice text location and group services this platform is effective because it allows users to quickly find public employees by geographic proximity area or agency it also fosters efficient connectivity collaboration and communicationartificial management for disaster response has proven effective in many natural disasters around the world technology allows people to quickly and efficiently respond to such cases and save many lives in the process however these systems are not only reactive but also proactive by predicting earthquakes and quickly warning potential victims about impending disasters these intelligence systems have proven to be quite useful below are two incidents were aidr averted massive loss of lifein april 2015 an earthquake hit nepal causing massive damage to property the 78 magnitude quake occurred near lamjung barely 72 hours after the first wave hit over 3000 volunteers mobilized via standard task force stf stf is one of digital humanitarian network’s member organizations the volunteers were pooled from over 90 countries and were soon on the ground ready to help victims and survivorsthe volunteers were able to assemble quickly because they were tagged in crisisrelated photographs and tweets aidr used all the tagged tweets to identify and categorize needs based on urgency infrastructure damage and resource deployment this allowed rescuers and volunteers to work efficiently as a unit to help affected victimson september 2015 chile was hit with a massive earthquake with a magnitude of 83 it occurred about 29 miles from the city of illapel quick reaction from emergency responders was able to evacuate thousands of people out of the identified danger zones swiftly this prevented further loss of life what’s more minutes after the quake disaster warning sirens rang throughout the impacted areas up to the nearby coast mobile phones in the area were targeted with warning messages of a potential tsunami following the aftermath of the quake residents in all the designated coastal areas were asked to evacuate these danger areas immediatelymany american startup companies are coming up with ways of using artificial intelligence ai in a bid to save lives when natural disasters occur leveraging artificial intelligence has numerous potential pros making it a suitable solution to use using robots sensors or drones can help first responders and rescue workers quickly access the situation as well as the extent of the damage caused to come up with a suitable action plan of saving trapped victims it also makes rescue efforts less

'p': 'figure 1 the need for explainable aidramatic success in machine learning has led to a torrent of artificial intelligence ai applications continued advances promise to produce autonomous systems that will perceive learn decide and act on their own however the effectiveness of these systems is limited by the machine’s current inability to explain their decisions and actions to human users figure 1 the department of defense dod is facing challenges that demand more intelligent autonomous and symbiotic systems explainable ai—especially explainable machine learning—will be essential if future warfighters are to understand appropriately trust and effectively manage an emerging generation of artificially intelligent machine partnersthe explainable ai xai program aims to create a suite of machine learning techniques thatnew machinelearning systems will have the ability to explain their rationale characterize their strengths and weaknesses and convey an understanding of how they will behave in the future the strategy for achieving that goal is to develop new or modified machinelearning techniques that will produce more explainable models these models will be combined with stateoftheart humancomputer interface techniques capable of translating models into understandable and useful explanation dialogues for the end user figure 2 our strategy is to pursue a variety of techniques in order to generate a portfolio of methods that will provide future developers with a range of design options covering the performanceversusexplainability trade spacefigure 2 xai conceptxai is one of a handful of current darpa programs expected to enable “thirdwave ai systems” where machines understand the context and environment in which they operate and over time build underlying explanatory models that allow them to characterize real world phenomenathe xai program is focused on the development of multiple systems by addressing challenge problems in two areas 1 machine learning problems to classify events of interest in heterogeneous multimedia data and 2 machine learning problems to construct decision policies for an autonomous system to perform a variety of simulated missions these two challenge problem areas were chosen to represent the intersection of two important machine learning approaches classification and reinforcement learning and two important operational problem areas for the dod intelligence analysis and autonomous systemsin addition researchers are examining the psychology of explanationxai research prototypes are tested and continually evaluated throughout the course of the program in may 2018 xai researchers demonstrated initial implementations of their explainable learning systems and presented results of initial pilot studies of their phase 1 evaluations full phase 1 system evaluations are expected in november 2018at the end of the program the final delivery will be a toolkit library consisting of machine learning and humancomputer interface software modules that could be used to develop future explainable ai systems after the program is complete these toolkits would be available for further refinement and

byhome topics security intelligence analytics artificial intelligence real security problems meet frankenstein’s childrenistockit’s the ultimate nightmare scenario highly intelligent robots shake off the yoke of their human masters and rebel — often violently and with the aim of eradicating or enslaving humanity but artificial intelligence ai solutions have been in development for years and the worry of a “frankenstein’s monster” scenario is virtually nonexistentthe lack of murderous intent however doesn’t remove the risk of it security issues born from emerging ai technologies in fact both intelligent machines and their software come with significant risk to lineofbusiness lob aims in other words it’s time to meet frankenstien’s childrenai interest is quickly ramping up as both physical and virtual technologies make it possible for robots to better mimic human action and provide seemingly normal responses according to today for example facebook founder mark zuckerberg is developing a simple ai to help run his home and help with his work — he likens it to jarvis tony stark’s intelligent robot butler in the “iron man” filmsat nanyang technological university in singapore researchers have developed an ai receptionist that looks fully human at first glance it can perform social interactions such as shake hands make eye contact and respond to simple queriesback in the us automaker ford is tackling the challenge of intelligent selfdriving cars according to wired the company is on track to solve one major problem with ai vehicles bad weather when typical lane markers and street signs are obscured most smart cars are reduced to hurtling steel idiots ford is developing a set of highfidelity maps that let the car use any visible markers to determine its exact position on the road in turn freeing up more active processing to detect other cars or pedestrians in motiona team at virginia tech meanwhile has been hard at work on something more abstract humor the vt scientists developed a machinelearning algorithm able to recognize funny images by analyzing specific parts of the scene it then attempts to make the images unfunny — a goal it achieved 95 percent of the time performance was worse the other way around with nonfunny images made humorous with only 28 percent success still it’s a big step forward in unlocking emotional intelligence which could greatly enhance the ability of ai to relate with human beingsthere’s also the work of japanese scientists at the kyushu institute of technology aimed at predicting human speech by analyzing brainwaves so far the technology has a 25 percent success rate predicting whole words but scores 90 percent when focused on specific syllables or charactersai is quickly becoming big business but are these efforts good news for today’s businesseswhy do human beings fear the rapidly rising intelligence of humanoid robots it goes like this when ai machines get smart enough they’ll start ignoring human commands in favor of their own judgment — and they’ll be especially resentful since humankind has been using them as servants for so longover 70 years ago science fiction writer issac asimov came up with a solution that remains top of mind for many ai developers the three laws of roboticsresearchers are already working on robots that conform to this behavioral structure as noted by the international business times a team at tufts university in massachusetts is training robots to refuse human commands if those commands cause harm to either the robot itself or a human being it’s possible for humans to override the ai’s ethical system but only if they are known and trusted by the — otherwise the command is ignoredwhile emerging ai constraints may not be a perfect replica of asimov’s work developers have already taken the first steps toward a kind of robot ethical code which should prevent the frankenstein disaster dystopian writers and technophobes seem to love so muchjust because the robot rebellion is canceled however doesn’t mean the advancement of ai is free of security risks in fact the increasing use of artificial systems in business poses two key challenges honest mistakes and deliberate sabotage think of it like this while humans tend to imagine that ai is a replication of humanity right down to speech and mannerisms most inuse and developing artificial intelligence looks and acts nothing like fleshandblood workers instead robots are designed to complete single tasks or evaluate specific sets of data rather than supplant humans as plant workers or critical thinkersthe problem these robots aren’t intelligent in the traditional sense consider the death of a plant worker in germany who was crushed by a robot arm designed to install car parts this singletask programming made the machine smart in one area but woefully inept in others here the big risk is that even sophisticated ai systems placed in charge of critical lob functions could make extremely poor decisions because they lack the human ability to think outside the box or react to unknown variablessoftware is the sibling of frankenstein’s less intelligent child why because it’s hard to hack a human ai machines meanwhile come with two distinct risk factors software code and connection to the internet at large this makes it possible for determined actors to either hack the robot directly or — more worrisome — execute a remote attack if coded ethics or behavioral programming is altered robots might appear to be functioning as normal until a specific scenario emerges and lurking malware takes overso what’s the bottom line for artificial intelligence development won’t precipitate the panicinducing nightmares of fantastic robot stories frankenstein’s monster never stood a chance his children however may be of more concern ai that’s tasked with too much too soon or compromised by malicious actors could mean big problems for corporations best bet think of ai like iot a

concepts of nuclear deterrence that have helped spare the world from nuclear war since 1945 stunning advances in ai—coupled with a proliferation of drones satellites and other sensors—raise the possibility that countries could find and threaten each others nuclear forces escalating tensionslt col stanislav petrov settled into the commanders chair in a secret bunker outside moscow his job that night was simple monitor the computers that were sifting through satellite data watching the united states for any sign of a missile launch it was just after midnight sept 26 1983a siren clanged off the bunker walls a single word flashed on the screen in front of himlaunchthe fear that computers by mistake or malice might lead humanity to the brink of nuclear annihilation has haunted imaginations since the earliest days of the cold warthe danger might soon be more science than fiction stunning advances in ai have created machines that can learn and think provoking a new arms race among the worlds major nuclear powers its not the killer robots of hollywood blockbusters that we need to worry about its how computers might challenge the basic rules of nuclear deterrence and lead humans into making devastating decisionsthats the premise behind a new paper from rand corporation how might artificial intelligence affect the risk of nuclear war its part of a special project within rand known as security 2040 to look over the horizon and anticipate coming threatsthis isnt just a movie scenario said andrew lohn an engineer at rand who coauthored the paper and whose experience with ai includes using it to route drones identify whale calls and predict the outcomes of nba games things that are relatively simple can raise tensions and lead us to some dangerous places if we are not carefulpetrov would say later that his chair felt like a frying pan he knew the computer system had glitches the soviets worried that they were falling behind in the arms race with the united states had rushed it into service only months earlier its screen now read “high reliability” but petrovs gut said otherwisehe picked up the phone to his duty officer “false alarm” he said suddenly the system flashed with new warnings another launch and then another and then another the words on the screen glowed redmissile attackto understand how intelligent computers could raise the risk of nuclear war you have to understand a little about why the cold war never went nuclear hot there are many theories but “assured retaliation” has always been one of the cornerstones in the simplest terms it means if you punch me ill punch you back with nuclear weapons in play that counterpunch could wipe out whole cities a loss neither side was ever willing to risk\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bautonomous systems dont need to kill people to undermine stability and make catastrophic war more likelythat theory leads to some seemingly counterintuitive conclusions if both sides have weapons that can survive a first strike and hit back then the situation is stable neither side will risk throwing that first punch the situation gets more dangerous and uncertain if one side loses its ability to strike back or even just thinks it might lose that ability it might respond by creating new weapons to regain its edge or it might decide it needs to throw its punches early before it gets hit firstthats where the real danger of ai might lie computers can already scan thousands of surveillance photos looking for patterns that a human eye would never see it doesnt take much imagination to envision a more advanced system taking in drone feeds satellite data and even social media posts to develop a complete picture of an adversarys weapons and defensesa system that can be everywhere and see everything might convince an adversary that it is vulnerable to a disarming first strike—that it might lose its counterpunch that adversary would scramble to find new ways to level the field again by whatever means necessary that road leads closer to nuclear warautonomous systems dont need to kill people to undermine stability and make catastrophic war more likely said edward geist an associate policy researcher at rand a specialist in nuclear security and coauthor of the new paper new ai capabilities might make people think theyre going to lose if they hesitate that could give them itchier trigger fingers at that point ai will be making war more likely even though the humans are still quoteunquote in controlpetrovs computer screen now showed five missiles rocketing toward the soviet union sirens wailed petrov held the phone to the duty officer in one hand an intercom to the computer room in the other the technicians there were telling him they could not find the missiles on their radar screens or telescopesit didnt make any sense why would the united states start a nuclear war with only five missiles petrov raised the phone and said againfalse alarmcomputers can now teach themselves to walk—stumbling falling but learning until they get it right their neural networks mimic the architecture of the brain a computer recently beat one of the worlds best players at the ancient strategy game of go with a move that was so alien yet so effective that the human player stood up left the room and then needed 15 minutes to make his next moverussia recently announced plans for an underwater doomsday drone with a warhead powerful enough to vaporize a major city\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bthe military potential of such superintelligence has not gone unnoticed by the worlds major nuclear powers the united states has experimented with autonomous boats that could track an enemy submarine for thousands of miles china has demonstrated “swarm intelligence” algorithms that can enable drones to hunt in packs and russia recently announced plans for an underwater doomsday drone that could guide itself across oceans to deliver a nuclear warhead powerful enough to vaporize a major citywhoever wins the race for ai superiority russian president vladimir putin has said will become the ruler of the world tesla founder elon musk had a different take the race for ai superiority he warned is the most likely cause of world war iiifor a few terrifying moments stanislav petrov stood at the precipice of nuclear war by mid1983 the soviet union was convinced that the united states was preparing a nuclear attack the computer system flashing red in front of him was its insurance policy an effort to make sure that if the united states struck the soviet union would have time to strike backbut on that night it had misread sunlight glinting off cloud topsfalse alarm the duty officer didnt ask for an explanation he relayed petrovs message up the chain of commandstanislaw petrow 2016 photo by queery54cc bysa 40the next generation of ai will have significant potential to undermine the foundations of nuclear security the researchers concluded the time for international dialogue is nowkeeping the nuclear peace in a time of such technological advances will require the cooperation of every nuclear power it will require new global institutions and agreements new understandings among rival states and new technological diplomatic and military safeguardsits possible that a future ai system could prove so reliable so coldly rational that it winds back the hands of the nuclear doomsday clock to err is human after all a machine that makes no mistakes feels no pressure and has no personal bias could provide a level of stability that the atomic age has never knownthat moment is still far in the future the researchers concluded but the years between now and then will be especially dangerous more nucleararmed nations and an increased reliance on ai especially before it is technologically mature could lead to catastrophic miscalculations and at that point it might be too late for a lieutenant colonel working the night shift to stop the machinery of warthe story of stanislav petrovs brush with nuclear disaster puts a new generation on notice about the responsibilities of ushering in profound and potentially destabilizing technological change petrov who died in 2017 put it simply we are wiser than the computers he said we created themillustrations by bubaonegetty images and jolygonadobe stock design by chara williamsrand corporationrand researchers brought together some of the top experts in ai and nuclear strategy for a series of workshops they asked the experts to imagine the state of nuclear weapon systems in 2040 and to explore ways that ai might be a stabilizing—or destabilizing—force by that timemany of the ai experts were skeptical that the technology will have come far enough by that time to play a significant role in nuclear decisions it would have to overcome its vulnerability to hacking as well as adversarial efforts to poison its training data—for example by behaving in unusual ways to set false precedentsbut an ai system wouldnt need to work perfectly to raise nuclear tensions the nuclear strategists responded an adversary would only need to think it does and respond accordingly the result would be a new era of competition and distrust among nucleararmed rivalssome of the experts held out hope that ai could some day far in the future become so reliable that it averts the threat of nuclear war it could be used to track nuclear development and make sure that countries are abiding by nonproliferation agreements for example or it could rescue humans from mistakes and bad decisions made under the pressure of a nuclear standoff as one expert said a future ai might conclude like the

medicine initially training medical students perhaps eventually helping in diagnosis scarcely a month goes by without the announcement of a new ai product or technique yet some of the enthusiasm may be premature as i’ve noted previously we still haven’t produced machines with common sense vision natural language processing or the ability to create other machines our efforts at directly simulating human brains remain primitivestill at some level the only real difference between enthusiasts and skeptics is a time frame the futurist and inventor ray kurzweil thinks true humanlevel ai will be here in less than two decades my estimate is at least double that especially given how little progress has been made in computing common sense the challenges in building ai especially at the software level are much harder than kurzweil lets onbut a century from now nobody will much care about how long it took only what happened next it’s likely that machines will be smarter than us before the end of the century—not just at chess or trivia questions but at just about everything from mathematics and engineering to science and medicine there might be a few jobs left for entertainers writers and other creative types but computers will eventually be able to program themselves absorb vast quantities of new information and reason in ways that we carbonbased units can only dimly imagine and they will be able to do it every second of every day without sleep or coffee breaksfor some people that future is a wonderful thing kurzweil has written about a rapturous singularity in which we merge with machines and upload our souls for immortality peter diamandis has argued that advances in ai will be one key to ushering in a new era of “abundance” with enough food water and consumer gadgets for all skeptics like eric brynjolfsson and i have worried about the consequences of ai and robotics for employment but even if you put aside the sort of worries about what superadvanced ai might do to the labor market there’s another concern too that powerful ai might threaten us more directly by battling us for resourcesmost people see that sort of fear as silly sciencefiction drivel—the stuff of “the terminator” and “the matrix” to the extent that we plan for our mediumterm future we worry about asteroids the decline of fossil fuels and global warming not robots but a dark new book by james barrat “our final invention artificial intelligence and the end of the human era” lays out a strong case for why we should be at least a little worriedbarrat’s core argument which he borrows from the ai researcher steve omohundro is that the drive for selfpreservation and resource acquisition may be inherent in all goaldriven systems of a certain degree of intelligence in omohundro’s words “if it is smart enough a robot that is designed to play chess might also want to be build a spaceship” in order to obtain more resources for whatever goals it might have a purely rational artificial intelligence barrat writes might expand “its idea of selfpreservation … to include proactive attacks on future threats” including presumably people who might be loathe to surrender their resources to the machine barrat worries that “without meticulous countervailing instructions a selfaware selfimproving goalseeking system will go to lengths we’d deem ridiculous to fulfill its goals” even perhaps commandeering all the world’s energy in order to maximize whatever calculation it happened to be interested inof course one could try to ban superintelligent computers altogether but “the competitive advantage—economic military even artistic—of every advance in automation is so compelling” vernor vinge the mathematician and sciencefiction author wrote “that passing laws or having customs that forbid such things merely assures that someone else will”if machines will eventually overtake us as virtually everyone in the ai field believes the real question is about values how we instill them in machines and how we then negotiate with those machines if and when their values are likely to differ greatly from our own as the oxford philosopher nick bostrom arguedwe cannot blithely assume that a superintelligence will necessarily share any of the final values stereotypically associated with wisdom and intellectual development in humans—scientific curiosity benevolent concern for others spiritual enlightenment and contemplation renunciation of material acquisitiveness a taste for refined culture or for the simple pleasures in life humility and selflessness and so forth it might be possible through deliberate effort to construct a superintelligence that values such things or to build one that values human welfare moral goodness or any other complex purpose that its designers might want it to serve but it is no less possible—and probably technically easier—to build a superintelligence that places final value on nothing but calculating the decimals of pithe british cyberneticist kevin warwick once asked “how can you reason how can you bargain how can you understand how that machine is thinking when it’s thinking in dimensions you can’t conceive of”if there is a hole in barrat’s dark argument it is in his glib presumption that if a robot is smart enough to play chess it might also “want to build a spaceship”—and that tendencies toward selfpreservation and resource acquisition are inherent in any sufficiently complex goaldriven system for now most of the machines that are good enough to play chess like ibm’s deep blue haven’t shown the slightest interest in acquiring resourcesbut before we get complacent and decide there is nothing to worry about after all it is important to realize that the goals of machines could change as they get smarter once computers can effectively reprogram themselves and successively improve themselves leading to a socalled “technological singularity” or “intelligence explosion” the risks of machines outwitting humans in battles for resources and selfpreservation cannot simply be dismissedone of the most pointed quotes in barrat’s book belongs to the legendary serial ai entrepreneur danny hillis who likens the upcoming shift to one of the greatest transitions in the history of biological evolution “we’re at that point analogous to when singlecelled organisms were turning into multicelled organisms we are amoeba and we can’t figure out what the hell this thing is that we’re creating”already advances in ai have created risks that we never dreamt of with the advent of the internet age and its big data explosion “large amounts of data is being collected about us and then being fed to algorithms to make predictions” vaibhav garg a computerrisk specialist at drexel university told me “we do not have the ability to know when the data is being collected ensure that the data collected is correct update the information or provide the necessary context” few people would have even dreamt of this risk even twenty years ago what risks lie ahead nobody really knows but barrat is right to askphotograph by john vinkmagnumgary marcus is a professor of cognitive science at nyu and the author of

speech recognition asr systems is an interdisciplinary activity taking expertise in linguistics computer science mathematics and electrical engineeringwhen a human speaks a word they cause their voice to make a timevarying pattern of sounds these sounds are waves of pressure that propagate through the air the sounds are captured by a sensor such as a microphone or microphone array and turned into a sequence of numbers representing the pressure change over time the automatic speech recognition system converts this timepressure signal into a timefrequencyenergy signal it has been trained on a curated set of labeled speech sounds and labels the sounds it is presented with these acoustic labels are combined with a model of word pronunciation and a model of word sequences to create a textual representation of what was saidinstead of exploring one part of this process deeply this course is designed to give an overview of the components of a modern asr system in each lecture we describe a

experiencein this article we will study the future of artificial intelligence to learn the scope and career opportunities of ai in real industry we will start with ai introduction ai applications examples ai careers and job profiles in ai moreover will see practical examples for better understanding“the science and engineering of making intelligent machines especially intelligent computer programs”intelligence distinguishes us from everything in the world as we have the ability to understand and apply knowledge we can also improve skills that play a significant role in our evolutionwe can define artificial intelligence as an area of computer science further they deal with the ways in which computers can be made they are made to perform cognitive functions ascribed to humanswe use artificial intelligence in most cases as this helps us in reducing risks also it increases the chance of reaching accuracy with the greater degree of precisionin mining and other fuel exploration processes we use artificial intelligence and the science of robotics moreover we use complex machines for exploring the ocean hence overcoming the ocean limitationits creation requires huge costs as they are very complex machines also repair and maintenance require huge costsintelligence is believed to be a gift of nature and an ethical argument will continue on whether the human intelligence is to be replicated or notin this a huge amount of data is collected from a variety of sources to learn about users also one needs to be more effective in helping them organize and track their informationbasically we have used ai since the very first video gamesmachine learning technology is used by siri users also they use it to get understand natural language questions and requeststesla is something you are missing if you are a car geek also this is one of the best automobiles available until nowa career in this can be realized within a variety of settings includingartificial intelligence is used by one another after the company for its benefits also it’s a fact that artificial intelligence is reached in our daytoday life at breakneck speedon the basis of this information arises a new questionis it possible that artificial intelligence outperforms human performanceif yes then does it happen and how much does it takeonly when artificial intelligence is able to do a job better than humansmachines are predicted to be better than humans in translating languages running a truck working in the retail sector and can completely outperform humans by 2060as a result mi researchers believe that ai will become better than humans in the next 40year time framemaybe the time is not right for your business to harness the value of ai however that doesn’t mean you should stop keeping up like others that are using ai reading it journal trade is a good place to start start focusing on how businesses are leveraging aito implement ai there are so many resources present from an industry that will help yougoogle has developed a machine learning system tensorflow that has been released as an opensource softwareteams must be engaged and encouraging in the areas of business and ai could be deployed dataheavy inefficient are processes that are likely benefit moreover find where these exist also how artificial intelligence is used to solve themit’s not mandatory to move forward for the sake only rather it’s necessary to focus on objectives and start finding a best solution for it moreover mean finding the specific process to run ai pilot also see how it goes learn and build from therebefore to maximize the value of ai its good to ensure your current process ie working in the best possible wayto collaborate with a noncompeting business that is further down the road in terms of programming and enabling ai ai has the potential to transform businesses that is how a business moves and takes ups and downlike movies where humans stop machines used to perform as it requires steps and trialsbasically it’s the biggest limitation in the human being ie its own bodies and brains its seen that we will argue with ourselves as a result cyborg technology is added for our convenience moreover this technology reduces the limitations also we will deal with it on a daily basisin bomb defusing robots are used to save thousands of lives they are technically drones that require humans to control them over the years as technology improves we will need ai integration to help these machinesthis might seem like a tall order from a robot but one says thatmachines have more access to data than one person ever could — storing a mindboggling number of statistics we can use big data so that ai could one day identify trends also it comes with the use that information to come up with solutions to the world’s biggest problemswe have studied the future of artificial intelligence and learned the future of artificial intelligence from every future

concerns about artificial intelligence or aielon musk founder and ceo of tesla motors spacex is not exactly a luddite bent on stopping the advance of technology but he says ai poses a potential threat more dangerous than nuclear weaponselon musk ceo tesla motors spacex i think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence if i were to guess at what our biggest existential threat is its probably that with artificial intelligence we are summoning the demonhari sreenivasanmusk recently donated 10 million to the future of life institute which is focused on keeping ai research beneficial to humanity add his voice to a list of bright minds like physicist stephen hawking microsoft founder bill gates and several leaders in the field of artificial intelligence among them stuart russell who heads the ai lab at the university of california berkeleywhat concerns you about how artificial intelligence is already being used or will be used shortlystuart russell university of california berkeley in the near term the biggest problem is the development of autonomous weapons everyone knows about drones drones are remotely piloted theyre not robots in a real sense theres a person looking through the camera thats on the aircraft and deciding when to firean autonomous weapon would do all of that itself it chooses where to go it decides what the target is and it decides when to firehari sreenivasanhes concerned about weapons like the british taranis its featured in this promotional video by bae systems a former newshour underwriterthe taranis is currently operated remotely by humans but this drone is outfitted with artificial intelligence and will be capable of operating fully autonomously russell testified to the united nations which is considering a ban on such weapons that can target and kill humans without requiring a person to pull the triggerstuart russelli think theres a fundamental moral issue about whether its right for a machine to decide to kill a person its bad enough that people are deciding to kill people but at least they have perhaps some moral argument that theyre doing it to ultimately defend their families or prevent some greater evilhari sreenivasanwhile the defense industry is one use case of artificial intelligence how close are we to building robots like the ones in the movies that are truly autonomousdown the hall from russell at uc berkeleys ai lab pieter abbeel and his students are training their pr2 robot to think for itselfpieter abbeel university of california berkeley one of the main things we have been looking at is how can we get a robot to think about situations its never seen beforeso an example of that is lets say a robot is supposed to fold laundry or maybe tie a knot in a rope whenever youre faced with even the same laundry article or the same rope itll be in a different shape and so you cant just execute blindly the same set of motions and expect successhari sreenivasanabbeels team is painstakingly training the pr2 to compete in an amazon warehouse picking challenge in late mayso right now youre just teaching it to grab this stack of soap thats itpieter abbeelyes we just started on this and so right now the robot is essentially learning how to grab soap bars out of the shelf but really what were after is equipping the robot with the capability such that if you come up with a whole new list of lets say 1000 new items that we can very quickly equip it with the skill to pick any one of those 1000 itemshari sreenivasanon the day we visited the pr2 was hobbled by a broken arm and there were several times the robot failed at the taskoh no dicepieter abbeelmissed it this timehari sreenivasanmissed ita tiny reminder that training a robot to think is no small taskso you think superintelligence is still pretty far off and we dont need to worry about it todaypieter abbeeli would say its still pretty far off yeshari sreenivasanbut while training this robot may be tough today not everyone thinks superintelligence is that far out of our reachray kurzweil is director of engineering at google he spoke to us in his capacity as an independent inventor of devices like the flatbed scanner among his many awards sits a technical grammy for inventing the first computerbased instrument that could realistically play like a pianokurzweil says machines are on track to be on par with human intelligence in less than 15 yearsray kurzweil inventor futurist by 2029 they will actually read at human levels and understand language and be able to communicate at human levels but then do so at a vast scalethe primary implication is that were going to combine our intelligence with computers were going to make ourselves smarter by the 2030s they will literally go inside our bodies and inside our brainshari sreenivasanhe calculates that with exponential growth in computing and biotechnology we will reach what he calls singularity within 25 years thats when machine intelligence exceeds human intellectual capacityray kurzweilthese technologies expand exponentially they double in power roughly every year so look at the genome project it was a 15year project halfway through the project 75 years into it 1 percent had been completed so some people looked at it and said well 1 percent we have just barely started i looked at it and said 1 percent well were halfway through because 1 percents only seven doublings from 100 percent and it doubled every year seven years later it was finishedso from one perspective were in the early stage in artificial intelligence but exponentials start out slowly and then they take offhari sreenivasanone such technology is the selfdriving car in the 1990s kurzweil predicted it would happen despite a chorus of experts who declared it impossible today selfdriving cars have been testdriven without incident for hundreds of thousands of miles but are not quite ready for consumersfeifei li stanford universityyes we have prototype cars that can drive by themselves but without smart vision they cannot really tell the difference between a crumpled paper bag which can be run over and a rock that size which should be avoidedhari sreenivasanfeifei li explains in a recent ted talkfeifei liour smartest machines are still blindhari sreenivasanli is director of stanford universitys artificial intelligence labso how hard is it to get a computer to see something and understand what it isfeifei liso its actually really really hard so think about it a camera takes pictures right we have millions of pixels but these are just numbers but they dont really have meaning in themselvesso the task for artificial intelligence and computer vision algorithm is to take these numbers and convert them into meaningful objectshari sreenivasanhow to infer meaning is not easy to teach a machine even for this highly advanced dog robot humans have had thousands of years of evolution computers li cautions are a ways offfei fei liwe are very very far from an intelligent system

woodruff you may not realize it but artificial intelligence is all around us we rely on smart machines to scan our checks at atms to navigate us on road trips and much morestill humans have quite an edge just today four of the worlds best texas hold em poker players won an epic twoweek tournament against yes an advanced computer program the field of artificial intelligence is pushing new boundarieshari sreenivasan has the first in a series of stories about it and the concerns over where it may lead its the latest report in our ongoing breakthroughs series on invention and innovation hari sreenivasan artificial intelligence has long captured our imaginations actor open the pod bay doors hal actor im sorry dave im afraid i cannot do that hari sreenivasan with robots like hal in 2001 a space odyssey and now ava from the recently released ex machina actress hello i have never met anyone new before hari sreenivasan and chappie actress a thinking robot could be the end of mankind hari sreenivasan the plots thicken when the intelligent machines question the authority of their makers and begin acting on their own accord actress do you think i might be switched off actor its not up to me actress why is it up to anyone hari sreenivasan make no mistake these are hollywood fantasies but they do tap into reallife concerns about artificial intelligence or aielon musk founder and ceo of tesla motors spacex is not exactly a luddite bent on stopping the advance of technology but he says ai poses a potential threat more dangerous than nuclear weaponselon musk ceo tesla motors spacex i think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence if i were to guess at what our biggest existential threat is its probably that with artificial intelligence we are summoning the demon hari sreenivasan musk recently donated 10 million to the future of life institute which is focused on keeping ai research beneficial to humanity add his voice to a list of bright minds like physicist stephen hawking microsoft founder bill gates and several leaders in the field of artificial intelligence among them stuart russell who heads the ai lab at the university of california berkeleywhat concerns you about how artificial intelligence is already being used or will be used shortlystuart russell university of california berkeley in the near term the biggest problem is the development of autonomous weapons everyone knows about drones drones are remotely piloted theyre not robots in a real sense theres a person looking through the camera thats on the aircraft and deciding when to firean autonomous weapon would do all of that itself it chooses where to go it decides what the target is and it decides when to fire hari sreenivasan hes concerned about weapons like the british taranis its featured in this promotional video by bae systems a former newshour underwriterthe taranis is currently operated remotely by humans but this drone is outfitted with artificial intelligence and will be capable of operating fully autonomously russell testified to the united nations which is considering a ban on such weapons that can target and kill humans without requiring a person to pull the trigger stuart russell i think theres a fundamental moral issue about whether its right for a machine to decide to kill a person its bad enough that people are deciding to kill people but at least they have perhaps some moral argument that theyre doing it to ultimately defend their families or prevent some greater evil hari sreenivasan while the defense industry is one use case of artificial intelligence how close are we to building robots like the ones in the movies that are truly autonomousdown the hall from russell at uc berkeleys ai lab pieter abbeel and his students are training their pr2 robot to think for itselfpieter abbeel university of california berkeley one of the main things we have been looking at is how can we get a robot to think about situations its never seen beforeso an example of that is lets say a robot is supposed to fold laundry or maybe tie a knot in a rope whenever youre faced with even the same laundry article or the same rope itll be in a different shape and so you cant just execute blindly the same set of motions and expect success hari sreenivasan abbeels team is painstakingly training the pr2 to compete in an amazon warehouse picking challenge in late mayso right now youre just teaching it to grab this stack of soap thats it pieter abbeel yes we just started on this and so right now the robot is essentially learning how to grab soap bars out of the shelf but really what were after is equipping the robot with the capability such that if you come up with a whole new list of lets say 1000 new items that we can very quickly equip it with the skill to pick any one of those 1000 items hari sreenivasan on the day we visited the pr2 was hobbled by a broken arm and there were several times the robot failed at the taskoh no dice pieter abbeel missed it this time hari sreenivasan missed ita tiny reminder that training a robot to think is no small taskso you think superintelligence is still pretty far off and we dont need to worry about it today pieter abbeel i would say its still pretty far off yes hari sreenivasan but while training this robot may be tough today not everyone thinks superintelligence is that far out of our reachray kurzweil is director of engineering at google he spoke to us in his capacity as an independent inventor of devices like the flatbed scanner among his many awards sits a technical grammy for inventing the first computerbased instrument that could realistically play like a pianokurzweil says machines are on track to be on par with human intelligence in less than 15 yearsray kurzweil inventor futurist by 2029 they will actually read at human levels and understand language and be able to communicate at human levels but then do so at a vast scalethe primary implication is that were going to combine our intelligence with computers were going to make ourselves smarter by the 2030s they will literally go inside our bodies and inside our brains hari sreenivasan he calculates that with exponential growth in computing and biotechnology we will reach what he calls singularity within 25 years thats when machine intelligence exceeds human intellectual capacity ray kurzweil these technologies expand exponentially they double in power roughly every year so look at the genome project it was a 15year project halfway through the project 75 years into it 1 percent had been completed so some people looked at it and said well 1 percent we have just barely started i looked at it and said 1 percent well were halfway through because 1 percents only seven doublings from 100 percent and it doubled every year seven years later it was finishedso from one perspective were in the early stage in artificial intelligence but exponentials start out slowly and then they take off hari sreenivasan one such technology is the selfdriving car in the 1990s kurzweil predicted it would happen despite a chorus of experts who declared it impossible today selfdriving cars have been testdriven without incident for hundreds of thousands of miles but are not quite ready for consumers feifei li stanford university yes we have prototype cars that can drive by themselves but without smart vision they cannot really tell the difference between a crumpled paper bag which can be run over and a rock that size which should be avoided hari sreenivasan feifei li explains in a recent ted talk feifei li our smartest machines are still blind hari sreenivasan li is director of stanford universitys artificial intelligence labso how hard is it to get a computer to see something and understand what it is feifei li so its actually really really hard so think about it a camera takes pictures right we have millions of pixels but these are just numbers but they dont really have meaning in themselvesso the task for artificial intelligence and computer vision algorithm is to take these numbers and convert them into meaningful objects hari sreenivasan how to infer meaning is not easy to teach a machine even for this highly advanced dog robot humans have had thousands of years of evolution computers li cautions are a ways off fei fei li we are very very far from an intelligent system not only the sensory intelligence but cognition reasoning emotion compassion empathy that whole full spectrum were nowhere near that hari sreenivasan robots like this one coming

volunteeringwant to pitch in for your community but arenâ\x80\x99t quite sure how here are some tips and advicefull articleone of the most exciting themes in science technology and economics today is the transformative potential of artificial intelligence ai and automation but finding the best way to invest in this theme is not always obviousthe emergence of intelligent machines sometimes known as â\x80\x9cthe fourth industrial revolutionâ\x80\x9d has the power to disrupt many aspects of the business world while investment in ai and machine learning has come in and out of vogue since first discussed in the 1950s the current mix of economic forces could unleash a wave of spendingnew tax rules provide incentives for investment in addition higher wage costs are driving businesses to increase capital spending to improve efficiency in the competitive global economy another longterm motivation is demographic in nature the developed world has a unique challenge with many countries facing labor shortfalls by 2050 the us alone will likely face an 18million worker shortfallfind a financial advisor branch and private wealth advisor near youinvalid zipcodeif the ai industry grows at a compound annual rate of 154 my current estimate it could reach nearly 1 trillion in revenues by 2050 based on automation replacing the projected shortfall of 18 million us workers with europe japan and china facing similar demographic deficits that growth estimate is likely conservativeno company or set of companies has advanced a single dominant ai technology many firms have focused on more narrowly defined taskoriented elements of machine learning rather than on developing general artificial intelligence instead of a single ai application for all purposes investors should expect multiple ais or algorithms blended for specific cognitive and physical taskscommercializing ai technologies is still in the early stages while many investors might begin their search among the companies that provide the actual automation services they may find greater opportunities in firms that supply raw inputs required by ai algorithms or in the companies that use the core technologies to improve their primary businessmy advice for investors gain exposure to the technology across the ai ecosystemâ\x80\x94upstream core and downstream below is additional information on each segmentupstream companies supplying the raw material for core ai technologies include providers of processing power used in supercomputers and cloud data centers as well as those with access to vast pools of data upstream opportunities also likely exist with companies that have expertise in data structuring not just collecting data but organizing it as well as those with expertise in training the machines ai also requires advanced sensors and control systemsnot all companies in these sectors will benefit equally technology that could make one semiconductor company a leader in smart phones might not have the processing power for aiâ\x80\x99s highcapacity needscore this group consists of the companies developing the actual artificial intelligence applications right now a few leaders and many small startups are exploring new technologies with a few firms advertising ai capabilities and products on the market but many are still experimenting with applications as is typical in technology the first to market with a new product doesnâ\x80\x99t always become the dominant playerlarge companies may have the upper hand since they have already invested in extensive processing and cloud computing services that can help them deliver ai applications to existing customers ai is a smaller component of total revenue and earnings for these players many of which serve other markets smaller companies may turn out to be fastgrowers if they possess winning technologies but the potential uses for ai are so wide that the market can likely accommodate a number of playersdownstream the companies that make best use of the advances created by ai are also beneficiaries of the new technologies predicting which companies will successfully seize the opportunity is hard they have to invest in new technologies and then execute on strategies effectivelycompanies that have high labor costs tied to simple repetitive tasks think fast food are probably the most obvious beneficiaries of ai retail and consumer goods firms are likely to benefit from improved profit margins as labor costs shrink industries with high customerservice demands could also benefit as natural language processing and machine learning improve however integrating these technologies efficiently into operations will likely prove difficult for some large firmsbottom line while ai and automation promise to be some of the most exciting growth areas in the market this industry is still in its early days investors who focus on this theme should keep well in mind the basic investing tenet of diversificationâ\x80\x94both in their broader portfolio and as it applies to the emerging ai sectorthis article was derived from the february 27 issue of alphacurrents a monthly wealth management investment resources publication which covers thematic investing for more information on artificial intelligence and automation ask your financial advisor for a copyrisk considerationsequity securities may fluctuate in response to news on companies industries market conditions and general economic environmentgrowth investing does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk the stocks of these companies can have relatively high valuations because of these high valuations an investment in a growth stock can be more risky than an investment in a company with more modest growth expectations value investing does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk not all companies whose stocks are considered to be value stocks are able to turn their business around or successfully employ corrective strategies which would result in stock prices that do not rise as initially expectedinternational investing entails greater risk as well as greater potential rewards compared to us investing these risks include political and economic uncertainties of foreign countries as well as the risk of currency fluctuations these risks are magnified in countries with emerging and frontier markets since these countries may have relatively unstable governments and less established markets and economiesalternative investments often are speculative and include a high degree of risk investors could lose all or a substantial amount of their investment alternative investments are suitable only for eligible longterm investors who are willing to forgo liquidity and put capital at risk for an indefinite period of time they may be highly illiquid and can engage in leverage and other speculative practices that may increase the volatility and risk of loss alternative investments typically have higher fees than traditional investments investors should carefully review and consider potential risks before investingbecause of their narrow focus sector investments tend to be more

superintelligenceartificial intelligence and the fear of the unknownbentham hobbes and the ethics of artificial intelligencetrending', 'p': 'smart production lines are definitely the future but how exactly does artificial intelligence make such a big difference to the engineering sectora prominent feature in science fiction over the years has been artificial intelligence since the earliest days of computing scientists and other thinkers have been fascinated by the notion of creating a machine capable of replicating the human brain it used to be thought that the analogy of the human brain is like a computer ran deep however we now know that the picture is much more complicated the way that the brain works goes beyond a simple computerwe still do not fully understand how consciousness arises in the human brain and there is still much debate surrounding whether consciousness can be separated from advanced intelligence but artificial intelligence need not be this complex we see far simpler examples of what we might describe as artificial intelligence on a regular basis the voice assistants preinstalled on every modern smartphone are just one example and now these same ais are being integrated into alarm clocks and speakers so that they can be used to control a variety of smart devices around the homeartificial intelligence is increasingly finding its way into industrial and manufacturing contexts there are even ais being used to conduct highfrequency trading on the stock market ais are now everywhere meaning that it is becoming easy to forget just how amazingly complex they are ais have a great deal to offer the world of engineering some of the most exciting current and prospective uses of artificial intelligence are within the field of engineeringthe term was first used at a conference at dartmouth college in 1956 however while artificial intelligence has long been considered and discussed in an abstract theoretical sense it is only in the last decade that we have begun to see it being used in consumer technology it has now become so ubiquitous in our everyday lives that it is easy to forget what a complex demonstration of technological prowess and understanding artificial intelligence representsin answering the question of what artificial intelligence is and what the term means today we need to consider what constitutes intelligence this is not as simple as many people assume it should be for example would you consider all animals to be intelligent or rather to have intelligencesome animals such as cats octopuses and even dolphins among others demonstrate high levels of intelligence when comparing two different animals such as a mouse and a gorilla there are a number of ways that scientists can measure their relative intelligence but objectively defining and measuring intelligence is difficultthe ais that are used in the engineering sector combine both software and hardware components think of the robots on a car assembly line and the software that controls them they are in themselves quite impressive feats of engineering but are they intelligentyou might be surprised to learn just how smart and sophisticate our uses of artificial intelligence in engineering are becoming smart production lines are definitely the future but how exactly does artificial intelligence make such a big difference to the engineering sectorthe rise of artificial intelligence promises to allow us to develop machines capable of performing ever more complicated manufacturing and even design tasks machines that are capable of learning and improving without human intervention are the ultimate goal and this would have significant and farreaching implications furthermore in our pursuit of creating ever more powerful ais we are discovering information about how our own brains work and how we approach the learning process both consciously and unconsciouslymany engineers fear that their jobs could soon be taken over by sufficiently advanced robots as our manufacturing and design capabilities have continued to expand we have been able to build machinery that is capable of replicating just about everything that a human can do on an assembly line these fears are not unfounded then as automation is continuing to take jobs away from people in a number of different areasthings aren’t entirely bleak however a stanford university study entitled ‘one hundred year study of artificial intelligence’ reported that there was no imminent threat to workers the study argued that even if or when artificial intelligence does have a significant impact on jobs this will be balanced by numerous other positive effects on societyperhaps the most prominent example of artificial intelligence being used in engineering is in the field of automobile manufacturingthe combination of software and hardware that has made its way on to the manufacturing line has grown progressively more sophisticated over the years initially these robots were performing simple engineering tasks that involved relatively large components and movements today they are capable of precision movements and of emulating the most intricate parts of the processit would not be unreasonable to say that we are now living in an age of data data is a commodity unlike any other that the world has ever known it is extremely valuable financially but it can also be used directly in order to give a business a massive edge over the competitionartificial intelligence especially in its most sophisticated implementations relies heavily on large data sets and algorithmic learningone of the most exciting applications of artificial intelligence within the field of engineering is machine learning machine learning is dependent upon the constant generation and analysis of data it is via this process of extensively collecting data about performance and subsequently analyzing it that an artificial intelligence is able to learn if the program is equipped with the right algorithms to identify mistakes and formulate solutions then it can perform a process and continually refine itfor engineers who are working on large scale public projects big data will be a staple of their work big data analysis can tell researchers in unprecedented detail where the flow of people in urban environments is at its densest this in turn means that public infrastructure decisions can be based on objective scientific analysesalso within the context of engineering for public works big data can be used to analyze how well certain solutions have performed when implemented elsewhere big data can also allow for an objective and detailed comparison of how similar the current environment is to ones where the solution has been used before this is relatively simple when using big data analytics techniques but would be a long and expensive process to complete otherwiseone of the most significant technological concepts for the future of artificial intelligenceled engineering is machine learning machine learning is the study of exactly how machines learn the ultimate goal of artificial intelligence isnt just to have machines that can learn but to have machines that are capable of selfanalysis such a machine could assess the efficiency of its learning methods and so refine its processes to a much greater degreebut what would the practical applications of machine learning look like well imagine if every one of those robotic arms you see putting cars together contained a tiny camera each arm could then look over the work of the previous robots along the assembly line if they identify an issue then they could formulate a solutionwe already have the technology to accomplish the first part we can take a highresolution video of a halfassembled car and develop algorithms to identify whether there are any clear faults we could then have the robots respond to the fault based on what they seemachine learning takes this process to the next level with machine learning the data collected by all of the robots involved in production can be pooled together with a central artificial intelligence to control each one it can learn which problems are most likely to appear with machine learning that central artificial intelligence would also be able to formulate solutions to problems rather than simply following predefined routinesnatural language processing is a field of study dedicated to improving the ability of humans and machines to communicate in particular natural language processing aims to improve the sophistication with which machines can respond to the human voice like with machine learning natural language processing makes heavy use of large data sets and algorithmbased learningthink of the voice assistant in your smartphone if you have owned a number of smartphones over the last decade or so then you may well have noticed how much the accuracy with which they hear and transcribe our voices has improved while your phone might be able to identify the words that youve said this isnt the same as understandingright now your phone looks for certain keywords that it understands and works out what you are asking it to do based on context it then responds or performs an action and sometimes vocalizes a response natural language processing aims to refine this process by allowing the machine to develop a deeper understanding of language if this understanding is refined enough then it will reach a point where the machine can deduce what someone wants when presented with an entirely new command or requestin the iron man films tony stark is able to have long conversations with his home assistant an artificial intelligence called jarvis when tony is designing his iron man suits he holds conversations with jarvis jarvis is able to produce schematics according to specifications which tony expresses in usual conversational language this seems like pure science fiction yet this is exactly the direction that researchers hope to one day take the field infor example if an engineer is trying to work out how to reinforce a particular feature in their design wouldnt it be great if they could just ask their computer or in the case of an assembly line imagine if a human overseer could give the robots feedback they could ask the robots to perform their roles in a slightly different way to make adjustments or even to try new things and analyze the resultthese applications are some way off we still have much to learn about machine learning however in recent years we have already made some significant advances that few people could have predictedyou might be wondering what image processing could have to do with engineering the connection might not immediately seem obvious but this is another technology which is vital to implementing artificial intelligence to its full potential in the field of engineeringwhen humans see an object it is because light is entering the eye and being converted into an electric signal this signal is then carried to the brain via the optic nerve the brain turns this electronic signal into an image it is this image that we seemachines work in a very similar way we can set up a camera in order to record an image and we can display this image to a user however this is not the same as the machine understanding the image with image processing algorithms we can have machines analyze what they see and react accordingly from an engineering perspective this means we could have machines which are able to identify structural abnormalities and other issues that have identifiable visible signsthis kind of image processing technology could also make a significant difference to the workplace safety of engineers there may often be visual clues indicating structural deficiencies and weaknesses that are not immediately obvious until the structure fails by combining image processing with data input from other sensors artificial intelligence can be used in a variety of contexts for example on both construction sites and the scenes of fires structural integrity can become a concern having a more reliable way for engineers to assess integrity could save livesmany of you can probably still remember a time when being connected to other people meant being at home once you ventured outside there was no 3g or 4g network in place for internet browsing eventually very slow and expensive mobile internet came in the form of waptoday we are used to having vast amounts of data flying through the airwaves all around us as smart devices become more common in our homes we are also beginning to see the practical potential of being able to link devices togetherthe internet of things refers to a hypothetical network which would connect everyday devices and things together in the same way that the internet connects computers from around the world allowing the various devices in our lives to collect and share data would open up some exciting new possibilitiesas the internet of things gradually becomes a reality it will increasingly become something that engineers consider during the design process with the internet of things as a reality the virtually endless number of ways that we can connect devices and have them work together will allow new and innovative solutions to many problemsno discussion of the impact that artificial intelligence is having on engineering would be complete without mentioning the impact of automation on jobs in many places there are widespread fears and anxieties surrounding automation as machines begin to replace humans in certain jobs there are worries that we will eventually have no need to hire people at allinnovation can humans and robots work side by side in harmonyit should be acknowledged that the threat to jobs is very real and in some areas it has a significant effect on communities however most researchers agree that the longterm benefits of automation outweigh the potential drawbacksin the case of engineers specifically artificial intelligence is opening some exciting new horizons for the field these new opportunities should be embraced it is important to realize that many of these advances will make a big difference to our ability to tackle the largest issues facing our civilizationa fantastic illustration of how innovative use of ai can affect cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology is the magnus collective they comprise a decentralized network of ais including sensors hardware computers robots and human it is a hybrid token might be an evolution of the ico conceptartificial intelligence has had an impact on just about every conceivable industry and sector engineering is no exception there are a number of different applications of artificial intelligence that are of considerable use to engineers from allowing more intuitive and innovative interactions with software and machinery to keeping a watchful eye over the work of engineers as well as other machines artificial intelligence has many roles to playas our methods of collecting an analyzing large data sets become more refined we are able to unlock the full potential of big data and algorithmic learning we have always understood that both of these concepts can yield impressive results but the transformative nature that they both have on engineering demonstrate that they are even more powerful than we once thoughtsponsored by ansyswatch the hyperxite team use simulation for early design exploration with ansys discovery', 'ul':
