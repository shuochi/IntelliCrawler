coveragenewsopinionartslivingmoresubscribe', 'p': 'advertisementsupported byby cade metzsan francisco — in 2004 geoffrey hinton doubled down on his pursuit of a technological idea called a neural networkit was a way for machines to see the world around them recognize sounds and even understand natural language but scientists had spent more than 50 years working on the concept of neural networks and machines couldn’t really do any of thatbacked by the canadian government dr hinton a computer science professor at the university of toronto organized a new research community with several academics who also tackled the concept they included yann lecun a professor at new york university and yoshua bengio at the university of montrealon wednesday the association for computing machinery the world’s largest society of computing professionals announced that drs hinton lecun and bengio had won this year’s turing award for their work on neural networks the turing award which was introduced in 1966 is often called the nobel prize of computing and it includes a 1 million prize which the three scientists will shareover the past decade the big idea nurtured by these researchers has reinvented the way technology is built accelerating the development of facerecognition services talking digital assistants warehouse robots and selfdriving cars dr hinton is now at google and dr lecun works for facebook dr bengio has inked deals with ibm and microsoft“what we have seen is nothing short of a paradigm shift in the science” said oren etzioni the chief executive officer of the allen institute for artificial intelligence in seattle and a prominent voice in the ai community “history turned their way and i am in awe”loosely modeled on the web of neurons in the human brain a neural network is a complex mathematical system that can learn discrete tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data by analyzing thousands of old phone calls for example it can learn to recognize spoken wordsthis allows many artificial intelligence technologies to progress at a rate that was not possible in the past rather than coding behavior into systems by hand — one logical rule at a time — computer scientists can build technology that learns behavior largely on its ownthe londonborn dr hinton 71 first embraced the idea as a graduate student in the early 1970s a time when most artificial intelligence researchers turned against it even his own phd adviser questioned the choice“we met once a week” dr hinton said in an interview “sometimes it ended in a shouting match sometimes not”neural networks had a brief revival in the late 1980s and early 1990s after a year of postdoctoral research with dr hinton in canada the parisborn dr lecun moved to att’s bell labs in new jersey where he designed a neural network that could read handwritten letters and numbers an att subsidiary sold the system to banks and at one point it read about 10 percent of all checks written in the united statesthough a neural network could read handwriting and help with some other tasks it could not make much headway with big ai tasks like recognizing faces and objects in photos identifying spoken words and understanding the natural way people talk“they worked well only when you had lots of training data and there were few areas that had lots of training data” dr lecun 58 saidbut some researchers persisted including the parisborn dr bengio 55 who worked alongside dr lecun at bell labs before taking a professorship at the university of montrealin 2004 with less than 400000 in funding from the canadian institute for advanced research dr hinton created a research program dedicated to what he called “neural computation and adaptive perception” he invited dr bengio and dr lecun to join himby the end of the decade the idea had caught up with its potential in 2010 dr hinton and his students helped microsoft ibm and google push the boundaries of speech recognition then they did much the same with image recognition“he is a genius and knows how to create one impact after another” said li deng a former speech researcher at microsoft who brought dr hinton’s ideas into the companydr hinton’s image recognition breakthrough was based on an algorithm developed by dr lecun in late 2013 facebook hired the nyu professor to build a research lab around the idea dr bengio resisted offers to join one of the big tech giants but the research he oversaw in montreal helped drive the progress of systems that aim to understand natural language and technology that can generate fake photos that are indistinguishable from the real thingthough these systems have undeniably accelerated the progress of artificial intelligence they are still a very long way from true intelligence but drs hinton lecun and bengio believe that new ideas will come“we need fundamental additions to this toolbox we have created to reach machines that operate at the level of true human

analysis acquire knowledge and adapt to an environment that varies over time or in a given context ai is already being used in many different applications today such asthis is only the beginning the internet of things iot is enabling tens of billions of intelligent connected devices that will make our lives easier and make the environments in which we live and work safer and more efficient often by providing more natural humanmachine communication the addition of ai capabilities to these smart things will significantly enhance their functionality and usefulness especially when the full power of these networked devices is harnessed – a trend that is often called ai on the edgeai uses an assembly of natureinspired computational methods to address complex realworld problems where mathematical or traditional modeling have proven ineffective examples include a process that is too complex for analytical modeling or when a process contains some unknowns due to its intrinsic dynamic behavior many reallife problems cannot be described in exact terms and fall into this category so they cannot be processed by traditional computing systemsartificial intelligence uses an approximation of the way the human brain reasons using inexact and incomplete knowledge to produce decisions and actions in an adaptive way with experience built up over timethe basic concepts behind ai have been around since the 1950’s but modern programming techniques such as python the availability of huge quantities of data opensource tools for neuralnetwork training powerful computing centers and everimproving embeddedprocessing systems are contributing to ai taking off as a worldchanging technology todaymachine learning ml is a subset of artificial intelligence and refers to techniques which enable machines to recognize underlying patterns and learn to make predictions and recommendations by analyzing data and experiences rather than through traditional explicit programming instructions ml adapts using new data and experiences to improve prediction performance over timedeep learning dl is a subset of machine learning it aims to learn data patterns and dependencies by using a hierarchy of multiple layers that mimics the neuron connections of the human brain and make up any deep neural network deep learning techniques work with very large datasets by analysing data recognizing patterns and making predictions on next data points before the advent of deeplearning techniques creating and testing algorithms to solve some problems required detailed subject expertise and writing and debugging dedicated handcrafted and often very complicated programs with deep learning a computer can train itself with a large set of data collected for this purpose the learning stage in which the neural network learns to classify different patterns may use datasets labelled in advance a process referred to as supervised learning in the case of unlabeled datasets the learning process is called unsupervised learning and during the training the neural network tries to cluster the dataset into groups with similar patterns in both cases the result is an artificial neural network ann that contains all the information necessary to carry out the task the ann uses the knowledge acquired in the training to infer data features from new incoming data this is called inference stage and can be deployed in embedded devices with memory and processing capabilities orders of magnitude smaller than the servers used to train the ann itselfback to topartificial neural networks anns are available in various types topologies and complexities to address a variety of problems across a wide spectrum of applications they can exploit the data provided by the exploding number of heterogeneous sensors present in our homes offices cars factories and personal itemsif we consider a model where the raw data from all these sensors are sent to a powerful central remote intelligence then we quickly see the escalation in required data bandwidth and computational capabilities in the cloud especially if you consider processing audio video or images from millions of end devices not to mention the potential latency generated by such a centralized systemai enables much more efficient endtoend solutions by switching from a centralized to a distributed intelligence system where some of the analysis done in the cloud is moved closer to the sensing and actions this distributed approach significantly reduces both the required bandwidth for data transfer and the processing capabilities of cloud servers it also offers data privacy advantages as personal source data is preanalyzed and provided to service providers with a higher level of interpretationmoreover depending on the complexity of the task ann solutions can offer various complexity levels including numbers of operations per inference run and memory requirements the input data rate realtime processing requirement and allowable latencyso ai and deep learning allow pure sw or mixed swhw lowpower solutions to be deployed close to the sensor enabling true edge computingmore about ai on the edge use casesback to topst has been engaged in ai research and development for several years as a leading supplier of high volume broadmarket embeddedprocessing solutions we are focused on developing scalable flexible products and technologies to allow ai approaches to benefit a wide variety of devices supporting a virtually unlimited number of use caseswhile most microcontrollers today do not have the memory and processing power to run the learning algorithms needed to create dnns they can run the dnns themselves – provided that the networks are optimized for microcontrollersst has created a tool to do that optimizing of dnns for a microcontroller stm32cubemxai is planned for release later this year as part of the stm32 software ecosystemthe tool takes the pretrained neural network model output from a broad range of the most popular ai frameworks including caffe cntk keras lasagne tensorflow and theano and maps it to an optimized dnn that is adapted to the memory and processingpower capabilities of a target stm32 microcontrollerthe tool can also check the functionality of the adapted dcnn – which can be 10x smaller than the original with negligible loss of accuracycheck out this

between ai ml and dlai and iot are inextricably intertwinedwant all the latest advances and tech news sent directly to your inboxcalum mcclellandiot for all', 'h4': 'unleashing each other’s potentialconverging technological advancements have made this possible', 'p': 'we’re all familiar with the term “artificial intelligence” after all it’s been a popular focus in movies such as the terminator the matrix and ex machina a personal favorite of mine but you may have recently been hearing about other terms like “machine learning” and “deep learning” sometimes used interchangeably with artificial intelligence as a result the difference between artificial intelligence machine learning and deep learning can be very uncleari’ll begin by giving a quick explanation of what artificial intelligence ai machine learning ml and deep learning dl actually mean and how they’re different then i’ll share how ai and the internet of things are inextricably intertwined with several technological advances all converging at once to set the foundation for an ai and iot explosionfirst coined in 1956 by john mccarthy ai involves machines that can perform tasks that are characteristic of human intelligence while this is rather general it includes things like planning understanding language recognizing objects and sounds learning and problem solvingwe can put ai in two categories general and narrow general ai would have all of the characteristics of human intelligence including the capacities mentioned above narrow ai exhibits some facets of human intelligence and can do that facet extremely well but is lacking in other areas a machine that’s great at recognizing images but nothing else would be an example of narrow aiat its core machine learning is simply a way of achieving aiarthur samuel coined the phrase not too long after ai in 1959 defining it as “the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed” you see you can get ai without using machine learning but this would require building millions of lines of codes with complex rules and decisiontreesso instead of hard coding software routines with specific instructions to accomplish a particular task machine learning is a way of “training” an algorithm so that it can learnhow “training” involves feeding huge amounts of data to the algorithm and allowing the algorithm to adjust itself and improveto give an example machine learning has been used to make drastic improvements to computer vision the ability of a machine to recognize an object in an image or video you gather hundreds of thousands or even millions of pictures and then have humans tag them for example the humans might tag pictures that have a cat in them versus those that do not then the algorithm tries to build a model that can accurately tag a picture as containing a cat or not as well as a human once the accuracy level is high enough the machine has now “learned” what a cat looks likedeep learning is one of many approaches to machine learning other approaches include decision tree learning inductive logic programming clustering reinforcement learning and bayesian networks among othersdeep learning was inspired by the structure and function of the brain namely the interconnecting of many neurons artificial neural networks anns are algorithms that mimic the biological structure of the brainin anns there are “neurons” which have discrete layers and connections to other “neurons” each layer picks out a specific feature to learn such as curvesedges in image recognition it’s this layering that gives deep learning its name depth is created by using multiple layers as opposed to a single layeri think of the relationship between ai and iot much like the relationship between the human brain and bodyour bodies collect sensory input such as sight sound and touch our brains take that data and makes sense of it turning light into recognizable objects and turning sounds into understandable speech our brains then make decisions sending signals back out to the body to command movements like picking up an object or speakingall of the connected sensors that make up the internet of things are like our bodies they provide the raw data of what’s going on in the world artificial intelligence is like our brain making sense of that data and deciding what actions to perform and the connected devices of iot are again like our bodies carrying out physical actions or communicating to othersthe value and the promises of both ai and iot are being realized because of the othermachine learning and deep learning have led to huge leaps for ai in recent years as mentioned above machine learning and deep learning require massive amounts of data to work and this data is being collected by the billions of sensors that are continuing to come online in the internet of things iot makes better aiimproving ai will also drive adoption of the internet of things creating a virtuous cycle in which both areas will accelerate drastically that’s because ai makes iot usefulon the industrial side ai can be applied to predict when machines will need maintenance or analyze manufacturing processes to make big efficiency gains saving millions of dollarson the consumer side rather than having to adapt to technology technology can adapt to us instead of clicking typing and searching we can simply ask a machine for what we need we might ask for information like the weather or for an action like preparing the house for bedtime turning down the thermostat locking the doors turning off the lights etcshrinking computer chips and improved manufacturing techniques means cheaper more powerful sensorsquickly improving battery technology means those sensors can last for years without needing to be connected to a power sourcewireless connectivity driven by the advent of smartphones means that data can be sent in high volume at cheap rates allowing all those sensors to send data to the cloudand the birth of the cloud has allowed for virtually unlimited storage of that data and virtually infinite computational ability to process itof course there are one or two concerns about the impact of ai on our society and our future but as advancements and adoption of both ai and iot continue to accelerate one thing is certain the impact is going to be profound🗓 this article was originally posted on

tools like technology are able to aid us in this pursuit we know they can also be designed and used in ways that dishonor god and devalue our fellow imagebearers evangelical christians hold fast to the inerrant and infallible word of god which states that every human being is made in god’s image and thus has infinite value and worth in the eyes of their creator this message dictates how we view god ourselves and the tools that god has given us the ability to createin light of existential questions posed anew by the emergent technology of artificial intelligence ai we affirm that god has given us wisdom to approach these issues in light of scripture and the gospel message christians must not fear the future or any technological development because we know that god is above all sovereign over history and that nothing will ever supplant the image of god in which human beings are created we recognize that ai will allow us to achieve unprecendented possibilities while acknowledging the potential risks posed by ai if used without wisdom and carewe desire to equip the church to proactively engage the field of ai rather than responding to these issues after they have already affected our communities in light of this desire and hope we offer the following affirmations and denials about the nature of humanity the promise of technology and the hope for the futurewe affirm that god created each human being in his image with intrinsic and equal worth dignity and moral agency distinct from all creation and that humanity’s creativity is intended to reflect god’s creative patternwe deny that any part of creation including any form of technology should ever be used to usurp or subvert the dominion and stewardship which has been entrusted solely to humanity by god nor should technology be assigned a level of human identity worth dignity or moral agencygenesis 12628 512 isaiah 4367 jeremiah 15 john 1334 colossians 116 310 ephesians 424we affirm that the development of ai is a demonstration of the unique creative abilities of human beings when ai is employed in accordance with god’s moral will it is an example of man’s obedience to the divine command to steward creation and to honor him we believe in innovation for the glory of god the sake of human flourishing and the love of neighbor while we acknowledge the reality of the fall and its consequences on human nature and human innovation technology can be used in society to uphold human dignity as a part of our godgiven creative nature human beings should develop and harness technology in ways that lead to greater flourishing and the alleviation of human sufferingwe deny that the use of ai is morally neutral it is not worthy of man’s hope worship or love since the lord jesus alone can atone for sin and reconcile humanity to its creator technology such as ai cannot fulfill humanity’s ultimate needs we further deny the goodness and benefit of any application of ai that devalues or degrades the dignity and worth of another human beinggenesis 225 exodus 203 31111 proverbs 164 matthew 223740 romans 323we affirm the use of ai to inform and aid human reasoning and moral decisionmaking because it is a tool that excels at processing data and making determinations which often mimics or exceeds human ability while ai excels in databased computation technology is incapable of possessing the capacity for moral agency or responsibilitywe deny that humans can or should cede our moral accountability or responsibilities to any form of ai that will ever be created only humanity will be judged by god on the basis of our actions and that of the tools we create while technology can be created with a moral use in view it is not a moral agent humans alone bear the responsibility for moral decision makingromans 268 galatians 51921 2 peter 158 1 john 21we affirm that airelated advances in medical technologies are expressions of god’s common grace through and for people created in his image and that these advances will increase our capacity to provide enhanced medical diagnostics and therapeutic interventions as we seek to care for all people these advances should be guided by basic principles of medical ethics including beneficence nonmaleficence autonomy and justice which are all consistent with the biblical principle of loving our neighborwe deny that death and disease—effects of the fall—can ultimately be eradicated apart from jesus christ utilitarian applications regarding healthcare distribution should not override the dignity of human life furthermore we reject the materialist and consequentialist worldview that understands medical applications of ai as a means of improving changing or completing human beingsmatthew 545 john 112526 1 corinthians 155557 galatians 62 philippians 24\u200bwe affirm that as a tool created by humans ai will be inherently subject to bias and that these biases must be accounted for minimized or removed through continual human oversight and discretion ai should be designed and used in such ways that treat all human beings as having equal worth and dignity ai should be utilized as a tool to identify and eliminate bias inherent in human decisionmakingwe deny that ai should be designed or used in ways that violate the fundamental principle of human dignity for all people neither should ai be used in ways that reinforce or further any ideology or agenda seeking to subjugate human autonomy under the power of the statemicah 68 john 1334 galatians 32829 51314 philippians 234 romans 1210we affirm the goodness of god’s design for human sexuality which prescribes the sexual union to be an exclusive relationship between a man and a woman in the lifelong covenant of marriagewe deny that the pursuit of sexual pleasure is a justification for the development or use of ai and we condemn the objectification of humans that results from employing ai for sexual purposes ai should not intrude upon or substitute for the biblical expression of sexuality between a husband and wife according to god’s design for human marriagegenesis 12629 21825 matthew 52730 1 thess 434we affirm that work is part of god’s plan for human beings participating in the cultivation and stewardship of creation the divine pattern is one of labor and rest in healthy proportion to each other our view of work should not be confined to commercial activity it must also include the many ways that human beings serve each other through their efforts ai can be used in ways that aid our work or allow us to make fuller use of our gifts the church has a spiritempowered responsibility to help care for those who lose jobs and to encourage individuals communities employers and governments to find ways to invest in the development of human beings and continue making vocational contributions to our lives togetherwe deny that human worth and dignity is reducible to an individual’s economic contributions to society alone humanity should not use ai and other technological innovations as a reason to move toward lives of pure leisure even if greater social wealth creates such possibilitiesgenesis 127 25 215 isaiah 652124 romans 1268 ephesians 41116we affirm that privacy and personal property are intertwined individual rights and choices that should not be violated by governments corporations nationstates and other groups even in the pursuit of the common good while god knows all things it is neither wise nor obligatory to have every detail of one’s life open to societywe deny the manipulative and coercive uses of data and ai in ways that are inconsistent with the love of god and love of neighbor data collection practices should conform to ethical guidelines that uphold the dignity of all people we further deny that consent even informed consent although requisite is the only necessary ethical standard for the collection manipulation or exploitation of personal data—individually or in the aggregate ai should not be employed in ways that distort truth through the use of generative applications data should not be mishandled misused or abused for sinful purposes to reinforce bias strengthen the powerful or demean the weakexodus 2015 psalm 1475 isaiah 401314 matthew 1016 galatians 62 hebrews 41213 1 john 17we affirm that ai has legitimate applications in policing intelligence surveillance investigation and other uses supporting the government’s responsibility to respect human rights to protect and preserve human life and to pursue justice in a flourishing societywe deny that ai should be employed for safety and security applications in ways that seek to dehumanize depersonalize or harm our fellow human beings we condemn the use of ai to suppress free expression or other basic human rights granted by god to all human beingsromans 1317 1 peter 21314we affirm that the use of ai in warfare should be governed by love of neighbor and the principles of just war the use of ai may mitigate the loss of human life provide greater protection of noncombatants and inform better policymaking any lethal action conducted or substantially enabled by ai must employ human oversight or review all defenserelated ai applications such as underlying data and decisionmaking processes must be subject to continual review by legitimate authorities when these systems are deployed human agents bear full moral responsibility for any actions taken by the systemwe deny that human agency or moral culpability in war can be delegated to ai no nation or group has the right to use ai to carry out genocide terrorism torture or other war crimesgenesis 410 isaiah 11617 psalm 3728 matthew 544 223739 romans 134\u200bwe affirm that the fundamental purposes of government are to protect human beings from harm punish those who do evil uphold civil liberties and to commend those who do good the public has a role in shaping and crafting policies concerning the use of ai in society and these decisions should not be left to those who develop these technologies or to governments to set normswe deny that ai should be used by governments corporations or any entity to infringe upon godgiven human rights ai even in a highly advanced state should never be delegated the governing authority that has been granted by an allsovereign god to human beings aloneromans 1317 acts 1035 1 peter 21314we affirm that ai will continue to be developed in ways that we cannot currently imagine or understand including ai that will far surpass many human abilities god alone has the power to create life and no future advancements in ai will usurp him as the creator of life the church has a unique role in proclaiming human dignity for all and calling for the humane use of ai in all aspects of societywe deny that ai will make us more or less human or that ai will ever obtain a coequal level of worth dignity or value to imagebearers future advancements in ai will not ultimately fulfill our longings for a perfect world while we are not able to comprehend or know the future we do not fear what is to come because we know that god is omniscient and that nothing we create will be able to thwart his redemptive plan for creation or to supplant humanity as his imagebearersgenesis 1 isaiah 428 romans 12021 52 ephesians 146 2 timothy 179 revelation 5910please note

microworld—for example a model of a ship’s hold and its cargo—that is selfcontained and relatively uncomplicated for such ai systems every effort is made to incorporate all the information about some narrow field that an expert or group of experts would know so that a good expert system can often outperform any single human expert there are many commercial expert systems including programs for medical diagnosis chemical analysis credit authorization financial management corporate planning financial document routing oil and mineral prospecting genetic engineering automobile design and manufacture camera lens design computer installation design airline scheduling cargo placement and automatic help services for home computer ownersthe basic components of an expert system are a knowledge base or kb and an inference engine the information to be stored in the kb is obtained by interviewing people who are expert in the area in question the interviewer or knowledge engineer organizes the information elicited from the experts into a collection of rules typically of an “ifthen” structure rules of this type are called production rules the inference engine enables the expert system to draw deductions from the rules in the kb for example if the kb contains the production rules “if x then y” and “if y then z” the inference engine is able to deduce “if x then z” the expert system might then query its user “is x true in the situation that we are considering” if the answer is affirmative the system will proceed to infer zsome expert systems use fuzzy logic in standard logic there are only two truth values true and false this absolute precision makes vague attributes or situations difficult to characterize when precisely does a thinning head of hair become a bald head often the rules that human experts use contain vague expressions and so it is useful for an expert system’s inference engine to employ fuzzy logicin 1965 the ai researcher edward feigenbaum and the geneticist joshua lederberg both of stanford university began work on heuristic dendral later shortened to dendral a chemicalanalysis expert system the substance to be analyzed might for example be a complicated compound of carbon hydrogen and nitrogen starting from spectrographic data obtained from the substance dendral would hypothesize the substance’s molecular structure dendral’s performance rivaled that of chemists expert at this task and the program was used in industry and in academiawork on mycin an expert system for treating blood infections began at stanford university in 1972 mycin would attempt to diagnose patients based on reported symptoms and medical test results the program could request further information concerning the patient as well as suggest additional laboratory tests to arrive at a probable diagnosis after which it would recommend a course of treatment if requested mycin would explain the reasoning that led to its diagnosis and recommendation using about 500 production rules mycin operated at roughly the same level of competence as human specialists in blood infections and rather better than general practitionersnevertheless expert systems have no common sense or understanding of the limits of their expertise for instance if mycin were told that a patient who had received a gunshot wound was bleeding to death the program would attempt to diagnose a bacterial cause for the patient’s symptoms expert systems can also act on absurd clerical errors such as prescribing an obviously incorrect dosage of a drug for a patient whose weight and age data were accidentally transposedcyc is a large experiment in symbolic ai the project began in 1984 under the auspices of the microelectronics and computer technology corporation a consortium of computer semiconductor and electronics manufacturers in 1995 douglas lenat the cyc project director spun off the project as cycorp inc based in austin texas the most ambitious goal of cycorp was to build a kb containing a significant percentage of the commonsense knowledge of a human being millions of commonsense assertions or rules were coded into cyc the expectation was that this “critical mass” would allow the system itself to extract further rules directly from ordinary prose and eventually serve as the foundation for future generations of expert systemswith only a fraction of its commonsense kb compiled cyc could draw inferences that would defeat simpler systems for example cyc could infer “garcia is wet” from the statement “garcia is finishing a marathon run” by employing its rules that running a marathon entails high exertion that people sweat at high levels of exertion and that when something sweats it is wet among the outstanding remaining problems are issues in searching and problem solving—for example how to search the kb automatically for information that is relevant to a given problem ai researchers call the problem of updating searching and otherwise manipulating a large structure of symbols in realistic amounts of time the frame problem some critics of symbolic ai believe that the frame problem is largely unsolvable and so maintain that the symbolic approach will never yield genuinely intelligent systems it is possible that cyc for example will succumb to the frame problem long before the system achieves human levels of knowledgeconnectionism or neuronlike computing developed out of attempts to understand how the human brain works at the neural level and in particular how people learn and remember in 1943 the neurophysiologist warren mcculloch of the university of illinois and the mathematician walter pitts of the university of chicago published an influential treatise on neural nets and automatons according to which each neuron in the brain is a simple digital processor and the brain as a whole is a form of computing machine as mcculloch put it subsequently “what we thought we were doing and i think we succeeded fairly well was treating the brain as a turing machine”it was not until 1954 however that belmont farley and wesley clark of mit succeeded in running the first artificial neural network—albeit limited by computer memory to no more than 128 neurons they were able to train their networks to recognize simple patterns in addition they discovered that the random destruction of up to 10 percent of the neurons in a trained network did not affect the network’s performance—a feature that is reminiscent of the brain’s ability to tolerate limited damage inflicted by surgery accident or diseasethe simple neural network depicted in the figure illustrates the central ideas of connectionism four of the network’s five neurons are for input and the fifth—to which each of the others is connected—is for output each of the neurons is either firing 1 or not firing 0 each connection leading to n the output neuron has a “weight” what is called the total weighted input into n is calculated by adding up the weights of all the connections leading to n from neurons that are firing for example suppose that only two of the input neurons x and y are firing since the weight of the connection from x to n is 15 and the weight of the connection from y to n is 2 it follows that the total weighted input to n is 35 as shown in the figure n has a firing threshold of 4 that is to say if n’s total weighted input equals or exceeds 4 then n fires otherwise n does not fire so for example n does not fire if the only input neurons to fire are x and y but n does fire if x y and z all firetraining the network involves two steps first the external agent inputs a pattern and observes the behaviour of n second the agent adjusts the connection weights in accordance with the rulesthe external agent—actually a computer program—goes through this twostep procedure with each pattern in a training sample which is then repeated a number of times during these many repetitions a pattern of connection weights is forged that enables the network to respond correctly to each pattern the striking thing is that the learning process is entirely mechanical and requires no human intervention or adjustment the connection weights are increased or decreased automatically by a constant amount and exactly the same learning procedure applies to different tasksin 1957 frank rosenblatt of the cornell aeronautical laboratory at cornell university in ithaca new york began investigating artificial neural networks that he called perceptrons he made major contributions to the field of ai both through experimental investigations of the properties of neural networks using computer simulations and through detailed mathematical analysis rosenblatt was a charismatic communicator and there were soon many research groups in the united states studying perceptrons rosenblatt and his followers called their approach connectionist to emphasize the importance in learning of the creation and modification of connections between neurons modern researchers have adopted this termone of rosenblatt’s contributions was to generalize the training procedure that farley and clark had applied to only twolayer networks so that the procedure could be applied to multilayer networks rosenblatt used the phrase “backpropagating error correction” to describe his method the method with substantial improvements and extensions by numerous scientists and the term backpropagation are now in everyday use in connectionismin one famous connectionist experiment conducted at the university of california at san diego published in 1986 david rumelhart and james mcclelland trained a network of 920 artificial neurons arranged in two layers of 460 neurons to form the past tenses of english verbs root forms of verbs—such as come look and sleep—were presented to one layer of neurons the input layer a supervisory computer program observed the difference between the actual response at the layer of output neurons and the desired response—came say—and then mechanically adjusted the connections throughout the network in accordance with the procedure described above to give the network a slight push in the direction of the correct response about 400 different verbs were presented one by one to the network and the connections were adjusted after each presentation this whole procedure was repeated about 200 times using the same verbs after which the network could correctly form the past tense of many unfamiliar verbs as well as of the original verbs for example when presented for the first time with guard the network responded guarded with weep wept with cling clung and with drip dripped complete with double p this is a striking example of learning involving generalization sometimes though the peculiarities of english were too much for the network and it formed squawked from squat shipped from shape and membled from mailanother name for connectionism is parallel distributed processing which emphasizes two important features first a large number of relatively simple processors—the neurons—operate in parallel second neural networks store information in a distributed fashion with each individual connection participating in the storage of many different items of information the knowhow that enabled the pasttense network to form wept from weep for example was not stored in one specific location in the network but was spread throughout the entire pattern of connection weights that was forged during training the human brain also appears to store information in a distributed fashion and connectionist research is contributing to attempts to understand how it does soother work on neuronlike computing includes the followingthe approach now known as nouvelle ai was pioneered at the mit ai laboratory by the australian rodney brooks during the latter half of the 1980s nouvelle ai distances itself from strong ai with its emphasis on humanlevel performance in favour of the relatively modest aim of insectlevel performance at a very fundamental level nouvelle ai rejects symbolic ai’s reliance upon constructing internal models of reality such as those described in the section microworld programs practitioners of nouvelle ai assert that true intelligence involves the ability to function in a realworld environmenta central idea of nouvelle ai is that intelligence as expressed by complex behaviour “emerges” from the interaction of a few simple behaviours for example a robot whose simple behaviours include collision avoidance and motion toward a moving object will appear to stalk the object pausing whenever it gets too closeone famous example of nouvelle ai is brooks’s robot herbert named after herbert simon whose environment is the busy offices of the mit ai laboratory herbert searches desks and tables for empty soda cans which it picks up and carries away the robot’s seemingly goaldirected behaviour emerges from the interaction of about 15 simple behaviours more recently brooks has constructed prototypes of mobile robots for exploring the surface of mars see the photographs and an interview with rodney brooksnouvelle ai sidesteps the frame problem discussed in the section the cyc project nouvelle systems do not contain a complicated symbolic model of their environment instead information is left “out in the world” until such time as the system needs it a nouvelle system refers continuously to its sensors rather than to an internal model of the world it “reads off” the external world whatever information it needs at precisely the time it needs it as brooks insisted the world is its own best model—always exactly uptodate and complete in every detailtraditional ai has by and large attempted to build disembodied intelligences whose only interaction with the world has been indirect cyc for example nouvelle ai on the other hand attempts to build embodied intelligences situated in the real world—a method that has come to be known as the situated approach brooks quoted approvingly from the brief sketches that turing gave in 1948 and 1950 of the situated approach by equipping a machine “with the best sense organs that money can buy” turing wrote the machine might be taught “to understand and speak english” by a process that would “follow the normal teaching of a child” turing contrasted this with the approach to ai that focuses on abstract activities such as the playing of chess he advocated that both approaches be pursued but until recently little attention has been paid to the situated approachthe situated approach was also anticipated in the writings of the philosopher bert dreyfus of the university of california at berkeley beginning in the early 1960s dreyfus opposed the physical symbol system hypothesis arguing that intelligent behaviour cannot be completely captured by symbolic descriptions as an alternative dreyfus advocated a view of intelligence that stressed the need for a body that could move about interacting directly with tangible physical objects once reviled by advocates of ai dreyfus is now regarded as a prophet of the situated approachcritics of nouvelle ai point out the failure to produce a system exhibiting anything like the complexity of behaviour found in real insects suggestions by researchers that their nouvelle systems may soon be conscious and possess language seem entirely prematurethe ongoing success of applied ai and of cognitive simulation as described in the preceding sections of this article seems assured however strong ai—that is artificial intelligence that aims to duplicate human intellectual abilities—remains controversial exaggerated claims of success in professional journals as well as the popular press have damaged its reputation at the present time even an embodied system displaying the overall intelligence of a cockroach is proving elusive let alone a system that can rival a human being the difficulty of scaling up ai’s modest achievements cannot be overstated five decades of research in symbolic ai have failed to produce any firm evidence that a symbol system can manifest human levels of general intelligence connectionists are unable to model the nervous systems of even the simplest invertebrates and critics of nouvelle ai regard as simply mystical the view that highlevel behaviours involving language understanding planning and reasoning will somehow emerge from the interaction of basic behaviours such as obstacle avoidance gaze control and object manipulationhowever this lack of substantial progress may simply be testimony to the difficulty of strong ai not to its impossibility let us turn to the very idea of strong artificial intelligence can a computer possibly think noam chomsky suggests that debating this question is pointless for it is an essentially arbitrary decision whether to extend common usage of the word think to include machines there is chomsky claims no factual question as to whether any such decision is right or wrong—just as there is no question as to whether our decision to say that airplanes fly is right or our decision not to say that ships swim is wrong however this seems to oversimplify matters the important question is could it ever be appropriate to say that computers think and if so what conditions must a computer satisfy in order to be so describedsome authors offer the turing test as a definition of intelligence however turing himself pointed out that a computer that ought to be described as intelligent might nevertheless fail his test if it were incapable of successfully imitating a human being for example why should an intelligent robot designed to oversee mining on the moon necessarily be able to pass itself off in conversation as a human being if an intelligent entity can fail the test then the test cannot function as a definition of intelligence it is even questionable whether passing the test would actually show that a computer is intelligent as the information theorist claude shannon and the ai pioneer john mccarthy pointed out in 1956 shannon and mccarthy argued that it is possible in principle to design a machine containing a complete set of canned responses to all the questions that an interrogator could possibly ask during the fixed time span of the test like parry this machine would produce answers to the interviewer’s questions by looking up appropriate responses in a giant table this objection seems to show that in principle a system with no intelligence at all could pass the turing testin fact ai has no real definition of intelligence to offer not even in the subhuman case rats are intelligent but what exactly must an artificial intelligence achieve before researchers can claim this level of success in the absence of a reasonably precise criterion for when an artificial system counts as intelligent there is no objective way of telling whether an ai research program has succeeded or failed one result of ai’s failure to produce a satisfactory criterion of intelligence is that whenever researchers achieve one of ai’s goals—for example a program that can summarize newspaper articles or beat the world chess champion—critics are able to say “that’s not intelligence” marvin minsky’s response to the problem of defining intelligence is to maintain—like turing before him—that intelligence is simply our name for any problemsolving mental process that we do not yet understand minsky likens intelligence to the concept “unexplored regions of africa” it disappears as

be profound but we need to prepare for a future in which job loss reaches 99powerpresslisten to the audio version of this articleadvances in artificial intelligence ai and automation will transform our world the current debate centers not on whether these changes will take place but on how when and where the impact of artificial intelligence will hit hardestcultural shifts of this magnitude always engender concern and fear—and for good reason a twoyear study from mckinsey global institute suggests that by 2030 intelligent agents and robots could eliminate as much as 30 percent of the world’s human labor mckinsey suggests that in terms of scale the automation revolution could rival the move away from agricultural labor during the 1900s in the united states and europe and more recently the explosion of the chinese labor economymckinsey reckons that depending upon various adoption scenarios automation will displace between 400 and 800 million jobs by 2030 requiring as many as 375 million people to switch job categories entirely how could such a shift not cause fear and concern especially for the world’s vulnerable countries and populationsthe brookings institution suggests that even if automation only reaches the 38 percent mean of most education predictions some western democracies are likely to resort to authoritarian policies to stave off civil chaos much like they did during the great depression brookings writes alarmingly “the united states would look like syria or iraq with armed bands of young men with few employment prospects other than war violence or theft” with frightening yet authoritative predictions like those it’s no wonder ai and automation keeps many of us up at nightthe luddites were textiles workers who protested against automation eventually attacking and burning factories because “they feared that unskilled machine operators were robbing them of their livelihood” the luddite movement occurred all the way back in 1811 so concerns about job losses or job displacements due to automation are far from newwhen fear or concern is raised about the potential impact of artificial intelligence and automation on our workforce a typical response is thus to point to the past the same concerns are raised time and again and prove unfoundedin 1961 president kennedy said “the major challenge of the sixties is to maintain full employment at a time when automation is replacing men” in the 1980s the advent of personal computers spurred “computerphobia” with many fearing computers would replace themso what happeneddespite these fears and concerns every technological shift has ended up creating more jobs than were destroyed when particular tasks are automated becoming cheaper and faster you need more human workers to do the other functions in the process that haven’t been automated“during the industrial revolution more and more tasks in the weaving process were automated prompting workers to focus on the things machines could not do such as operating a machine and then tending multiple machines to keep them running smoothly this caused output to grow explosively in america during the 19th century the amount of coarse cloth a single weaver could produce in an hour increased by a factor of 50 and the amount of labour required per yard of cloth fell by 98 this made cloth cheaper and increased demand for it which in turn created more jobs for weavers their numbers quadrupled between 1830 and 1900 in other words technology gradually changed the nature of the weaver’s job and the skills required to do it rather than replacing it altogether” — the economist automation and anxietylooking back on history it seems reasonable to conclude that fears and concerns regarding ai and automation are understandable but ultimately unwarranted technological change may eliminate specific jobs but it has always created more in the processbeyond net job creation there are other reasons to be optimistic about the impact of artificial intelligence and automation“simply put jobs that robots can replace are not good jobs in the first place as humans we climb up the rungs of drudgery — physically tasking or mindnumbing jobs — to jobs that use what got us to the top of the food chain our brains” — the wall street journal the robots are coming welcome themby eliminating the tedium ai and automation can free us to pursue careers that give us a greater sense of meaning and wellbeing careers that challenge us instill a sense of progress provide us with autonomy and make us feel like we belong all researchbacked attributes of a satisfying joband at a higher level ai and automation will also help to eliminate disease and world poverty already ai is driving great advances in medicine and healthcare with better disease prevention higher accuracy diagnosis and more effective treatment and cures when it comes to eliminating world poverty one of the biggest barriers is identifying where help is needed most by applying ai analysis to data from satellite images this barrier can be surmounted focusing aid most effectivelyi am all for optimism but as much as i’d like to believe all of the above this bright outlook on the future relies on shaky premises namelyas explored earlier a common response to fears and concerns over the impact of artificial intelligence and automation is to point to the past however this approach only works if the future behaves similarly there are many things that are different now than in the past and these factors give us good reason to believe that the future will play out differentlyin the past technological disruption of one industry didn’t necessarily mean the disruption of another let’s take car manufacturing as an example a robot in automobile manufacturing can drive big gains in productivity and efficiency but that same robot would be useless trying to manufacture anything other than a car the underlying technology of the robot might be adapted but at best that still only addresses manufacturingai is different because it can be applied to virtually any industry when you develop ai that can understand language recognize patterns and problem solve disruption isn’t contained imagine creating an ai that can diagnose disease and handle medications address lawsuits and write articles like this one no need to imagine ai is already doing those exact thingsanother important distinction between now and the past is the speed of technological progress technological progress doesn’t advance linearly it advances exponentially consider moore’s law the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles roughly every two yearswhat do you get when technological progress is accelerating and ai can do jobs across a range of industries an accelerating pace of job destruction“there’s no economic law that says ‘you will always create enough jobs or the balance will always be even’ it’s possible for a technology to dramatically favour one group and to hurt another group and the net of that might be that you have fewer jobs” —erik brynjolfsson director of the mit initiative on the digital economyin the past yes more jobs were created than were destroyed by technology workers were able to reskill and move laterally into other industries instead but the past isn’t always an accurate predictor of the future we can’t complacently sit back and think that everything is going to be okwhich brings us to another critical issue …let’s pretend for a second that the past actually will be a good predictor of the future jobs will be eliminated but more jobs will be created to replace them this brings up an absolutely critical question what kinds of jobs are being created and what kinds of jobs are being destroyed“low and highskilled jobs have so far been less vulnerable to automation the lowskilled jobs categories that are considered to have the best prospects over the next decade — including food service janitorial work gardening home health childcare and security — are generally physical jobs and require facetoface interaction at some point robots will be able to fulfill these roles but there’s little incentive to roboticize these tasks at the moment as there’s a large supply of humans who are willing to do them for low wages” — slate will robots steal your jobblue collar and white collar jobs will be eliminated—basically anything that requires middleskills meaning that it requires some training but not much this leaves lowskill jobs as described above and highskill jobs which require high levels of training and educationthere will assuredly be an increasing number of jobs related to programming robotics engineering etc after all these skills will be needed to improve and maintain the ai and automation being used around usbut will the people who lost their middleskilled jobs be able to move into these highskill roles instead certainly not without significant training and education what about moving into lowskill jobs well the number of these jobs is unlikely to increase particularly because the middleclass loses jobs and stops spending money on food service gardening home health etcthe transition could be very painful it’s no secret that rising unemployment has a negative impact on society less volunteerism higher crime and drug abuse are all correlated a period of high unemployment in which tens of millions of people are incapable of getting a job because they simply don’t have the necessary skills will be our reality if we don’t adequately prepareso how do we prepare at the minimum by overhauling our entire education system and providing means for people to reskillto transition from 90 of the american population farming to just 2 during the first industrial revolution it took the mass introduction of primary education to equip people with the necessary skills to work the problem is that we’re still using an education system that is geared for the industrial age the three rs reading writing arithmetic were once the important skills to learn to succeed in the workforce now those are the skills quickly being overtaken by aifor a fascinating look at our current education system and its glaring faults check out this video from sir ken robinsonin addition to transforming our whole education system we should also accept that learning doesn’t end with formal schooling the exponential acceleration of digital transformation means that learning must be a lifelong pursuit constantly reskilling to meet an everchanging worldmaking huge changes to our education system providing means for people to reskill and encouraging lifelong learning can help mitigate the pain of the transition but is that enoughthis claim may seem bold and yet it’s all but certain all you need are two premisesthe first premise shouldn’t be at all controversial the only reason to think that we would permanently stop progress of any kind is some extinctionlevel event that wipes out humanity in which case this debate is irrelevant excluding such a disaster technological progress will continue on an exponential curve and it doesn’t matter how fast that progress is all that matters is that it will continue the incentives for people companies and governments are too great to think otherwisethe second premise will be controversial but notice that i said human intelligence i didn’t say “consciousness” or “what it means to be human” that human intelligence arises from physical processes seems easy to demonstrate if we affect the physical processes of the brain we can observe clear changes in intelligence though a gloomy example it’s clear that poking holes in a person’s brain results in changes to their intelligence a wellplaced poke in someone’s broca’s area and voilà—that person can’t process speechwith these two premises in hand we can conclude the following we will build machines that have humanlevel intelligence and higher it’s inevitablewe already know that machines are better than humans at physical tasks they can move faster more precisely and lift greater loads when these machines are also as intelligent as us there will be almost nothing they can’t do—or can’t learn to do quickly therefore 99 of jobs will eventually be eliminatedbut that doesn’t mean we’ll be redundant we’ll still need leaders unless we give ourselves over to robot overlords and our arts music etc may remain solely human pursuits too as for just about everything else machines will do it—and do it better“but who’s going to maintain the machines” the machines “but who’s going to improve the machines” the machinesassuming they could eventually learn 99 of what we do surely they’ll be capable of maintaining and improving themselves more precisely and efficiently than we ever could', 'ul': 'techagricultureai mlar vr mrasset trackingblockchainbuilding

solutions offer ways to bridge the gap between data science and execution the process of sifting through and analyzing huge dumps of data was once an insurmountable process and is now not only feasible but it’s actually easylet’s think about all of the new technologies that have hit the market in the past year or so we’ve all heard about the iphone 7 google’s driverless cars snapchat glasses and even elon musk’s ‘city on mars’ what about marketingspecific technologies thoughartificial intelligence marketing ai marketing is a method of leveraging customer data and ai concepts like machine learning to anticipate your customer’s next move and improve the customer journeythe evolution of big data and advanced analytic solutions have made it possible for marketers to build a clearer picture of their target audiences than ever before and in this hotbed of advancement lies artificial intelligence ai marketingarmed with big data insights digital marketers can greatly boost their campaigns’ performance and roi all of which can be achieved with essentially no extra effort on the marketer’s part while this definition provides an overview of artificial intelligence marketing at the most basic level there is obviously much more that goes into it we’ll be addressing all of the details in the content to followthere are a few key elements that make ai marketing as powerful as it is today including bid data machine learning and the right solutionsbig data is a pretty straightforward concept it refers to a marketer’s ability to aggregate and segment large sets of data with minimal manual work marketing teams can then use this data to ensure the right message is being delivered to the right person at the right time via the channel of choicemachine learning platforms come in handy when marketers try to make sense of this huge data repository they can help identify trends or common occurrences and effectively predict common insights responses and reactions so marketers can understand the root cause and likelihood of certain actions repeatingartificial intelligence marketing solutions truly understand the world in the same way a human would this means that the platforms can identify insightful concepts and themes across huge data sets incredibly fast ai solutions also interpret emotion and communication like a human which makes these platforms able to understand open form content like social media natural language and email responsesso what does this mean for marketing teams ai marketing has been gaining more attention among marketers because of the insights it provides according to a recent pwc study 72 view ai as a “business advantage”let’s review some ways that marketers can expect ai to influence marketing outcomes in the upcoming months and yearsas advanced technology solutions grow smarter it’s important to remember that audiences are becoming smarter as well thanks to social media and rapidfire search engines thanks google people find what they are looking for faster than ever before ai and big data solutions can actually analyze these search patterns and help marketers identify key areas where they should focus their effortsmarketers are already dipping their toes into smarter ads with accountbased marketing solutions but ai helps teams take this a layer further for truly insightful analysis with a new abundance of data available online ads can become smarter and more effective ai solutions can dig deep into keyword searches social profiles and other online data for humanlevel outcomeswith ai marketers can take data and targeting to a whole new level audience analytics can go past the typical demographics level to understand people on an individual basis now marketers can use ai to both identify potential clients or buyers and deliver the ideal content that’s most relevant to them with big data machine learning and ai combined there is little a savvy marketer can’t achievecustomer service and retention is another area where ai will play a huge role in the future soon chat functions and other directtoconsumer engagement avenues will be run by ai bots many companies can save employee time and expenditures with these tactics ai bots also have access to an entire internet’s worth of data information and search histories making them much more efficient than their human counterpartsnot only can ai be used to uncover oncehidden insights it can actually be taught and learn to incorporate previously uncovered insights into new campaigns optimizing outreach to target only the most relevant users over time these ai solutions will become even more intelligent effectively eliminating waste greatly increasing conversions and promoting realtime decisionmakingdoes this

'p': 'posted on august 9 2018it has been said that artificial intelligence will define the next generation of software solutions if you are even remotely involved with technology you will almost certainly have heard the term with increasing regularity over the last few years it is likely that you will also have heard different definitions for artificial intelligence offered such as“the ability of a digital computer or computercontrolled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings” – encyclopedia britannica“intelligence demonstrated by machines in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans” – wikipediahow useful are these definitions what exactly are “tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings” for many people such definitions can seem too broad or nebulous after all there are many tasks that we can associate with human beings what exactly do we mean by “intelligence” in the context of machines and how is this different from the tasks that many traditional computer systems are able to perform some of which may already seem to have some level of intelligence in their sophistication what exactly makes the artificial intelligence systems of today different from sophisticated software systems of the pastit could be argued that any attempt to try to define “artificial intelligence” is somewhat futile since we would first have to properly define “intelligence” a word which conjures a wide variety of connotations nonetheless this article attempts to offer a more accessible definition for what passes as artificial intelligence in the current vernacular as well as some commentary on the nature of today’s ai systems and why they might be more aptly referred to as “intelligent” than previous incarnationsfirstly it is interesting and important to note that the technical difference between what used to be referred to as artificial intelligence over 20 years ago and traditional computer systems is close to zero prior attempts to create intelligent systems known as expert systems at the time involved the complex implementation of exhaustive rules that were intended to approximate intelligent behavior for all intents and purposes these systems did not differ from traditional computers in any drastic way other than having many thousands more lines of code the problem with trying to replicate human intelligence in this way was that it requires far too many rules and ignores something very fundamental to the way intelligent beings make decisions which is very different from the way traditional computers process informationlet me illustrate with a simple example suppose i walk into your office and i say the words “good weekend” your immediate response is likely to be something like “yes” or “fine thanks” this may seem like very trivial behavior but in this simple action you will have immediately demonstrated a behavior that a traditional computer system is completely incapable of in responding to my question you have effectively dealt with ambiguity by making a prediction about the correct way to respond it is not certain that by saying “good weekend” i actually intended to ask you whether you had a good weekend here are just a few possible intents behind that utteranceand morethe most likely intended meaning may seem obvious but suppose that when you respond with “yes” i had responded with “no i mean it was a good football game at the weekend wasn’t it” it would have been a surprise but without even thinking you will absorb that information into a mental model correlate the fact that there was an important game last weekend with the fact that i said “good weekend” and adjust the probability of the expected response for next time accordingly so that you can respond correctly next time you are asked the same question granted those aren’t the thoughts that will pass through your head you happen to have a neural network aka “your brain” that will absorb this information automatically and learn to respond differently next timethe key point is that even when you do respond next time you will still be making a prediction about the correct way in which to respond as before you won’t be certain but if your prediction fails again you will gather new data which leads to my suggested definition of artificial intelligence as it stands today“artificial intelligence is the ability of a computer system to deal with ambiguity by making predictions using previously gathered data and learning from errors in those predictions in order to generate newer more accurate predictions about how to behave in the future”this is a somewhat appropriate definition of artificial intelligence because it is exactly what ai systems today are doing and more importantly it reflects an important characteristic of human beings which separates us from traditional computer systems human beings are prediction machines we deal with ambiguity all day long from very trivial scenarios such as the above to more convoluted scenarios that involve playing the odds on a larger scale this is in one sense the essence of reasoning we very rarely know whether the way we respond to different scenarios is absolutely correct but we make reasonable predictions based on past experiencejust for fun let’s illustrate the earlier example with some code in r if you are not familiar with r but would like to follow along see the instructions on installation first lets start with some data that represents information in your mind about when a particular person has said “good weekend” to youin this example we are saying that goodweekendresponse is our score label ie it denotes the appropriate response that we want to predict for modelling purposes there have to be at least two possible values in this case “yes” and “no” for brevity the response in most cases is “yes”we can fit the data to a logistic regression modelnow what happens if we try to make a prediction on that model where the expected response is different than we have previously recorded in this case i am expecting the response to be “go england” below some more code to add the prediction for illustration we just hardcode the new input data output is shown in boldthe initial prediction “yes” was wrong but note that in addition to predicting against the new data we also incorporated the actual response back into our existing model also note that the new response value “go england” has been learnt with a probability of 50 percent based on current data if we run the same piece of code again the probability that “go england” is the right response based on prior data increases so this time our model chooses to respond with “go england” because it has finally learnt that this is most likely the correct responsedo we have artificial intelligence here well clearly there are different levels of intelligence just as there are with human beings there is of course a good deal of nuance that may be missing here but nonetheless this very simple program will be able to react with limited accuracy to data coming in related to one very specific topic as well as learn from its mistakes and make adjustments based on predictions without the need to develop exhaustive rules to account for different responses that are expected for different combinations of data this is this same principle that underpins many ai systems today which like human beings are mostly sophisticated prediction machines the more sophisticated the machine the more it is able to make accurate predictions based on a complex array of data used to train various models and the most sophisticated ai systems of all are able to continually learn from faulty assertions in order to improve the accuracy of their predictions thus exhibiting something approximating human intelligenceyou may be wondering based on this definition what the difference is between machine learning and artificial intelligence after all isn’t this exactly what machine learning algorithms do make predictions based on data using statistical models this very much depends on the definition of machine learning but ultimately most machine learning algorithms are trained on static data sets to produce predictive models so machine learning algorithms only facilitate part of the dynamic in the definition of ai offered above additionally machine learning algorithms much like the contrived example above typically focus on specific scenarios rather than working together to create the ability to deal with ambiguity as part of an intelligent system in many ways machine learning is to ai what neurons are to the brain a building block of intelligence that can perform a discreet task but that may need to be part of a composite system of predictive models in order to really exhibit the ability to deal with ambiguity across an array of behaviors that might approximate to intelligent behaviorthere are a number of practical advantages in building ai systems but as discussed and illustrated above many of these advantages are pivoted around “time to market” ai systems enable the embedding of complex decision making without the need to build exhaustive rules which traditionally can be very time consuming to procure engineer and maintain developing systems that can “learn” and “build their own rules” can significantly accelerate organizational growthmicrosoft’s azure cloud platform offers an array of discreet and granular services in the ai and machine learning domain that allow ai developers and data engineers to avoid reinventing wheels and consume reusable apis these apis allow ai developers to build systems which display the type of intelligent behavior discussed aboveif you want to dive in and

iot cloud computing salesforce statistical analysisread morebusiness intelligence is a technology that is used to gather store access and analyzes data to help business users in making better decisions on the other hand artificial intelligence is a way to make a computer a computercontrolled robot or a software that think intelligently like humansartificial intelligence is based on the study that how human thinks learn decide and work in order to resolve an issue and then using the outcome of this study as a basis of developing intelligent software and systemsbelow is the top 6 comparision between artificial intelligence vs business intelligencereporting olaponline analytical processingit starts from root node and explores neighbor nodes first and moves to the next level neighbor nodesit provides the shortest path to the solution and can be implemented using fifothis extract the predictive information in the form of humanunderstandable rules and these rules can be ifthenelse which leads to the predictive informationthis algorithm is implemented using lifolast in first outdata structureit creates nodes same as breadthfirst search but it differs in only orderin each iteration it stores the nodes from root to leaf and also it cannot check duplicate nodesit makes predictions by using bayes algorithm which derives probability prediction from the underlying evidence as observed in datain this algorithm sorting is done in increasing cost of the path to a nodeit always expands the least cost nodethis search is identical to the breadthfirst search if each transition has the same costit explores the path in the increasing order of costit implements logistic regression for classification of binary targets and linear regression for continuous targetsit supports confidence bounds for prediction probabilities and also supports confidence bounds for predictionit performs the depthfirst search at level1 and starts over then executes a complete depthfirst search to level 2 and continues till it gets the solutionit is an information theoretic model selection principleit assumes that most simple compact representation of data is the best way to explain the datait expands nodes in the order of their heuristic valuesit creates two lists a closed list for the already expanded nodes and an open list for the created but unexpanded nodesin this the shorter paths are saved and longer paths are disposed ofit is a distancebased clustering algorithm that partitions the data into a predetermined number of clusterseach cluster has a centroidin this algorithm the main aim is to find a lowcost tour that starts from a city visits all cities enroute exactly once and ends at the same city startingit performs marketbased analysis by discovering cooccurring items within a setthis algorithm finds rules with support greater than a specified minimum support and confidence greater than a specified minimum confidenceit is an iterative algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution to a problem and attempts to find a better solution by changing a single element of the solution incrementallyif that change produces a better solution an incremental change is taken as a new solutionthis process is repeated until there is no further improvementsdistinct versions of svm use different kernel functions to handle different types of data setslinear and gaussiannonlinear kernels are supportedsvm classification attempts to separate the target classes with the widest possible marginsvm regression tries to find a continuous function such that the maximum number of data points lie within an epsilonwide tube around itartificial intelligence and business intelligence are a perfect matchartificial intelligence and business intelligence is witnessed through aipowered alerts from basic thresholdalerts to advanced neural network alerts and helps a business stay in full control of key success factors by alarming them as soon as something takes placewhen combined with innovative business dashboards these ai advances will continue to revolutionalize the business intelligence landscapeall of this businesses to step away from the timeintensive process of digging through data to unearth trends and reacting to costly issuesartificial intelligence is at the center of a new enterprise to build a computational model of intelligencethe main assumption is that intelligence of human can be represented in terms of symbol structures and symbolic operations which can be programmed in a digital computerbusiness intelligence makes it possible for groups within an organization to gain actionable insight from business data and to leverage these insights to meet criteriabusiness intelligence solutions offer

futureat the end of this post you’ll be excited about the possibilities of ai and probably a little nervous about the implicationsand it’s alright to be nervous because the role of marketers in organizations will change but……you’ll still have an important role to playwould you prefer to read this later if so download a pdf version of the ai guidec h a p t e r – 1artificial intelligence in marketing is real and now is the time to sit up and take noticeartificial intelligence is accelerating marketing toward a more intelligently automated future in which smarter ie aipowered solutions enable marketers to solve problems and achieve goals more efficiently you have a choice you can sit back and wait for the marketing world to get smarter and change around you or you can embrace ai now and be proactive in creating a competitive advantage for yourself and your companyhowever not all software companies really have ai that say they dothere’s just so much hype surrounding ai tech companies want to capitalize on it by saying their software is powered by ai and investors will give higher valuations to them because of the ai in their softwarebut there are many great software companies building true ai applications and this is set to grow massively over the next few yearsmrfr research predicted the ai market to be worth 25 billion by 2025if you’re a marketer it’s time to get up to speed and understand the potential impact that ai will have on marketing i’m pretty sure that this guide will helpwe all know what human intelligence is…i hope so anywayartificial intelligence is when a machine demonstrates some humanlike intelligencefor examplea machine processes data and learns from it so it can make smarter decisions about the data it will process in the futureinstead of just repeating the same instructions the machine automatically learns new instructions based on experiencealpha zero the game playing ai developed by deepmind learned chess in 4 hours and then was able to beat the best computer program available for playing chesslearning a new game is mimicking human intelligence but the ai can learn in 4 hours what a human may take months doingcomputer science describes the study of ai as the development of intelligent agentslookthis is really about smart programmingour intelligence helps create artificial intelligenceas some tasks become very routine they may not be considered artificial intelligence anymorehere’s an exampleoptical character recognition is often excluded because it’s a routine task expected from computersnarrow ai also called weak ai is artificial intelligence focused on one taskstrong ai is everything elsestrong ai has the ability to apply intelligence to any problem rather than a specific taskfor examplea spam filtering tool performs one task well a selfdriving car is also described as narrow ai but i think this is a bit of a stretchyes… somemarketing is a timeintensive process with a lot of repetitive tasks which machines can help with……but there are certain tasks that machines will never be able to perform at the same level as human marketersi can imagine in the future sitting across from a robot discussing a business proposition but i can’t imagine i’d build the same relationship with a robot as with a real human it’s relatively easy to build software to beat someone at chess and……the software gets better at beating peoplebut…building relationships is the most important part of marketing and computers suck at italso who is going to build a strategy for a companyan ai enabled machine can provide inputs into this strategy but strategists will still survivei watched a movie called ‘her’ recently where the actor builds a relationship with an operating systemsuch a ridiculous moviecurrently though there is a serious problem with implementing ai within organizations because of the lack of knowledge amongst marketersin a report done with cmos chief marketing officers by deloitte in 2018 the major factor that could slow down the organic growth in marketing is lack of talentand because ai is more technical than most other areas of marketing this is going to be a major issuei wrote this guide because there is so much technical information on ai online that it’s quite difficult to understand i’m hoping this guide will help marketers understand what ai is really aboutonce you understand ai then you can work out how to replace the systems you use internally with ai software and if you decide it’s smart to replace the existing software solutions you need to figure out what functionality will be gone and what new functionality will be addedyou’ll then need to educate your team about ai and train them on the new softwareplus the marketplace for ai solutions is growing so fast that without understanding ai you’ll have a hard time finding the right vendorc h a p t e r – 2artificial intelligence is a complex field that includes various elementsit is focused on the followinghere’s a breakdown of the main areas that ai has been implemented innote there are some overlaps in each of the areas for example a selfdriving car uses a combination of machine learning image recognition and deep learninga brain takes an input external or internal processes it and then produces a resulta neuron is the basic unit of computation in the brain and it’s responsible for processing those inputs to produce the outputschemical signals are passed from neurons to neuronsthere are over 100 billion neurons on average in a human body and it’s an extremely complex web of interconnections between neurons some neurons can be connected to up 10000 other neuronsimagine if someone was putting their hand near a hot stove this is an input the neurons would process this causing the hand to move from the stovehere’s how this would look internallythe sensory neuron feels the heat passing the information onto other internal neurons and eventually to a motor neuron which causes the reaction of moving away from the heata single neuron doesn’t do much on its own but using a complex web of neurons gives you amazing capabilitiesthe neuron consists of input output and weight weight is really an indicator of importance in the overall scheme of things for this particular piece of informationfor example you want a machine to work out how valuable a car isyou take in a range of inputs eg year make model condition mileage etc and these are passed through neurons each input is weightedthe make and the model are weighted higher than the mileage or the yearand thenthrough a series of complex calculations the machine comes up with a resulthere’s a simple example of a neural networkthe initial inputs are weighted eg characteristics based on importance they are then sent to the hidden layer for processing and the result is the outputmachine learning is a branch of ai which enables computers to become progressively better at performing existing tasks or become able to do new tasks without any need for human interventionthe computers are continuously analyzing data so they can produce better results in the future simply put they’re becoming smartermachine learning is typically broken down into 3 partsearlier we talked about neural networks deep learning uses more advanced neural networksso instead of an input hidden and output layer you may have many hidden layersmeaning there is a lot more processing done than with a basic neural network the same system of weights is passed between the neuronsdeep learning is typically categorized in the following waysupervised learning is where you provide the computer with input data and then the output data ie the results you’d expect you then build an algorithm around this so you can start providing new input data and the computer will automatically create the output datafor example imagine if you had a spam filter instead of giving the computer a set of rules to determine whether an email is spam or not you provide it with a set of emails and then tell it which of those emails is spam and why the algorithm would then be used to work out a new set of emailswith unsupervised machine learning you provide the input data but you don’t provide the output data the input could be a batch of test data at firstso the computer doesn’t have any example data to help it generate the answers it needs to do a bit more workthis is a happy medium it’s not completely unsupervised but the output data is not enough to accurately predict all resultsso the computer processes the data and uses the output data as a guideline that it improves over time as it processes more datayou may want to use semisupervised ml in cases when you have to manually classify the data but there’s so much to classify that you just classify a piece of it and leave the rest to the computer to deal withthis is what natural language processing is about…alexa is an amazon deviceyou ask questions in a conversational way and alexa is able to process them and give a responsewell it usually is…natural language processing nlp systems have become more advanced over the last few years but there are still many challengesfor example it wouldn’t be unusual to say the followingalexa – who are man u playingmanchester united supporters often abbreviate manchester united to man u or the red devils or just saying united there’s a slim chance that alexa would understand these abbreviationshere’s another challenging example for nlp“i was at a pub the other night with my mates and it was deadly”when we use the word ‘deadly’ in this context in ireland we mean that it was great fun nlp systems are still not good at detecting the sentiment of text or spoken wordso nlp will continue to evolve but it will never be perfect because ofthis is the definition of evolutionary computation from wikipedia“in computer science evolutionary computation is a family of algorithms for global optimization inspired by biological evolution and the subfield of artificial intelligence and soft computing studying these algorithms”but what does this actually mean…it was called evolutionary because it’s a continuous process of optimization of results which ‘evolves’ better solutions over timeit was also called evolutionary from darwin’s theory of evolutionfor example one of darwin’s theories was about survival of the fittest the weakest members of a species will die over timewith evolutionary computing you come up with many potential solutions to a problem some may be good and some may be completely randomwith testing over time the best solutions evolvewith deep learning we are focusing on models we know already evolutionary computing is coming up with solutions to problems where we don’t have any sample results we could use to helpwe’re talking about the ability of computersmachines or robots to see process and act automatically based on imagesai for vision it’s generally split intocomputer vision – a computer extracting information from an image to make sense of itmachine vision – machines using visual methods to improve things in areas such as a production environment they could be visually identifying faults reviewing food labels andor detecting flaws in a productrobot vision – this is where vision is used to identify something to be worked on and the robotic capabilities perform the necessary actionrobots are physical machinesrobotics is the field of study of robotssometimes you’ll hear people talking about robots automatically creating content for marketers but these are not actually robots there’s no physical robot involvedmost robots do not have ai but this is changingfor example i used to own a robotic lawnmower called ‘robomow’ the tagline was ‘it mows you don’t’ i actually used to sell them but that’s a whole different storyrobomow sits on a charging unit and every few days it would come out and cut the grass there was an electrical cable around the edge of the garden and the mower would go back and forth at different angles to the edges it recorded where it had been so it knew when everywhere was cutit even had rain sensors so if it was raining it wouldn’t come out to cut the grassbut it didn’t have artificial intelligencefor example it could have learned about obstacles in the garden and built different routes based on those obstaclesunfortunately mine just kept getting stuck underneath the trampoline……every time…looki’m not saying these devices are not usefulbut…they could be a lot smarteran expert system is a computer program that emulates the human ability to make decisionsie it replaces the need for or supports an existing expertit typically contains a knowledge base with a set of rules for applying the knowledge to each particular situationwith machine learning capabilities it’s building its knowledge base over time and adapting or creating new decisions based on its working knowledgein the not too distant future it will be unusual for someone not to have a device such as an amazon echo in their home so they can voice questions and instructions to this device and get immediate answersvoice interpretation is getting better all the time and some of these devices are leveraging artificial intelligence to learn over time and produce better responsesimagine if a speech recognition system was able to predict if a sale was going to be generated from a call center and then make suggestions to agents to improve the conversion rateand they did this by analyzing the conversation and the acoustics in this conversationa company called oto systems studied 4000 hours of inbound sales conversations with 50 conversion ratesthey trained their deep learning models to capture the ‘acoustic signature’ of a successful salethey managed to predict 94 of the call outcomesthey then implemented this system in a call center and seen a 20 increase in engagement with a 5 increase in salesaccording to wikipedia these are strategies or sequences of actions automatically created for intelligent agents robots or unmanned vehiclesso its all about analyzing a problem and producing a plan of actionai planning is taking into account things likewhen the plan and the schedule are created it is automatically adjusted based on results and changes to inputsfor example if a resource is not available any more then the plan has to be adjustedc h a p t e r – 3there are so many potential uses of ai in marketing that would make it more efficient and help deliver better resultswe have talked about 1 to 1 marketing for many years and even with advanced marketing automation systems this is still not a realitybut…with artificial intelligence we have a much better chance of delivering what feels more like a oneonone customer communicationlet’s take a look at some examples of how marketing can improve with aito survive on the web we need to produce contentcontent attracts visitors engages our audience and gives them an incentive to come backcontent comes in many formsai will never take over the full role of content marketer but it can certainly helpcan computers automatically create content that doesn’t sound like it was created by a computeryesa 2017 report by statista found that over 90 of people surveyed said that getting personalized content was ‘verysomewhat’ appealing’its no surprise that people want to feel like you are providing information and content that is just relevant to them they don’t care about anyone elsemarketers don’t have the time to personalize all content but luckily ai can helphere’s howmarketmuse is a software platform that gives users guidance for creating the right content it uses big data and ai to understand how search engines rank contentit crunches all your data and compares with other companies’ ranking for similar contentit then organizes your content into topic clusters defining the topics that are easy to rank for and provides recommendations on how to improve your contentperforming a content audit is a really timeconsuming process and a software like this can save you massive amounts of timehere’s an example where marketmuse analyzes the top search results for marketing tools it extracts the most relevant terms within each of the top ranking content pieces and compares this with your contentthe tool displays the number of mentions of these keywords in competitor content compared to the number of mentions in your content you get a content score that you can improve to rank higherby analyzing your content marketmuse determines your ‘topic authority’ these are the topics you could easily rank for by creating more content around themneurolinguistic generation nlg is a technology that transforms data into humansounding narrativesautomated insights is a company that does exactly what their name suggeststhey analyze the data and automatically produce text that describes the dataimagine if you were in a stockbroking firm and you had to create 1000 different reports for customers that’s a dreadful thought isn’t itnow imagine clicking on a button and generating those reports automaticallyai may not write a book or replace me as a blogger but it can certainly help a lot with content creationcontent amplification is the process of promoting and distributing content through paid and unpaid tactics to achieve greater reachwith so much noise online even the most epic content won’t perform well unless you promote itcontent promotion used to take up a big chunk of content marketers’ time but now there are some really smart tools out there that can help automate this processhere’s one exampleinpowered is a tool that lets you select the content you want to promote across many native advertising platforms and then automates the process of placing the promotion and getting the best pay per click ratesit will cancel promotions on certain platforms increase promotions on other platforms and analyze what’s working and whenall fully automatedthis platform is interesting because the technology is very good and you only pay for engaged users if someone views your content and immediately bounces you won’t get chargedhow about optimizing content to drive more traffic from googlein the olden days you could stuff the same keyword many times into your article to rankbut now…google does semantic analysis of your content to understand what the content is aboutit uses machine learning rankbrain to understand the content you writealso it’s not just looking at keywords it’s looking at topic authorityhere’s an example of how to demonstrate topic authority on your siteyou create a pillar piece of content like this piece of contentyou then create related pieces of content which link to the pillar content and the pillar links to the relatedyou may even take one step further and create guest post content on other websites linking to the related or pillar content on your sitethis shows topic authority which is more important than one post targeting a specific keywordgoogle uses ai to figure out your topic authority so it makes sense that we need tools that leverage ai to figure out if we are providing the right signals to googlethis is what marketmuse and other tools in this area doa content curation tool is great for finding relevant content you are interested infor example you set up a set of keywords and it finds content that is popular related to those keywordsbut……the ai version of the content curation tool takes an extra steptake fraseio as an examplethis finds content but then uses ai to summarize the content so you don’t have to read it alli don’t know about you but that sounds awesome to mein terms of content curation ai should assist in the following workflows– making more targeted queries and removing noise when monitoring the media– summarizing information to help knowledge workers consume content faster and only dig deeper when relevant– identifying relationships between topics and drawing trends over timeimproved content curation through ai should help marketers create better newsletters incorporate more research on their original content scale their social media posting and create richer internal microsites digital publishers may use aidriven content curation to automatically generate reports and enrich their editorial workflowwe typically break analytics down into descriptive predictive and prescriptive analytics but let’s add a fourth dimensiondescriptive analytics has been around for a long timean example of this would be seeing google analytics data but not knowing what to do with itpredictive analytics gives you ideas of what you might do and prescriptive tells you what you need to doactionoriented analytics is where actions are automatically taken and tested based on what is prescribedsometimes i log into my wife’s netflix account by mistake and most of the recommendations are not the movies i would watchbut when i log into my netflix account it always shows something of interest to menetflix automatically groups people into different categories and ratings are based on the feedback within the category you are placed inso when i see a percentage rating indicating how likely i am to like a movie this rating could be different for my wife as she’s in a different categorynetflix continuously tries to provide better recommendations to market better movies to their usersbut they don’t just look at the movieshow you started watching they will also look atand of course much morethese are machine learning algorithms that are learning over time and automatically adjustinga uk company called datalytyx have patented an ai solution which solves a major problem of analyzing large volumes of data for example analzying billions of recordsit’s ai software identifies the most relevant 1 of the data and you run reports based on thisa typical marketing automation task is sending a series of emails to users after they opted in to an email listand then based on their interaction with emails route people to a different pathfor example the click on a link about a new product in the second email in a sequence triggers a different emailthis is smart email automation but it’s not aiai adds a whole new layer of intelligence here are some exampleswatson is an ibm platform that uses ai to learn more about your data‘watson marketing‘ is a part of the watson platform focused on…you guessed it…marketingone of its components is creating targeted email campaignsit uses ai to understand more about each individual in the campaign and tailors the communication based on this datafor example instead of just putting people into a bucket based on a form they fill out it pulls the data from many sources and creates microsegments based on lifestyle social behavior life stage location etcbut it will also continuously evaluate this data and automatically move people between segments based on new data and performance analysiswhen you are working with large data sets you need ai to automate certain tasks and make sense of datafor examplecompile data from many sources and create microsegments based on lifestyle social behavior life stage location etcdiscover flaws in original campaigns and change segments and offers based on thisa chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate a conversation with another humanthere are many tools available eg mobile monkey which allow you to easily create a chatbotthey have a builder program which allows you to automatically create actions based on inputshowever these chatbots are not aienabled they are trained to recognize specific user intents and they tap into a knowledge base to retrieve answers retrievalbased chatbotswe’re still far from seeing chatbots that can provide users with an unlimited amount of answers that they can generate on the fly this would be the true ai at workmost chatbots today operate in a specific niche and the amount of things that they know and can do is very limited however they still use nlp techniques to understand human language the more sophisticated ones also use sentiment analysis to understand the emotion behind the user’s wordschatbots as they are today are still a very useful tool to help automate certain parts of the sales and marketing processfor example chatbots cannow for companies that already use chatbots on their website there are tools that can help them understand how well they’re performinglivepersoncom analyzes chatbot conversations in realtime to assess when customers are having a poor customer experience companies can then take action based on thisnot sure if we’ll use this…may come up with a new diagramemail marketing is one area that could benefit tremendously from aijust think about it – an ai tool could help you determine which type of content you need to send and when you need to send it to increase your chances of converting an individual prospectgiven the fact that ai can process enormous amounts of data in no time you’d be running smarter and more efficient campaigns with a better roi not the mention the time you’d save on ab testingan email marketing tool powered by ai could also help with another challenging area for marketers – sending highly personalized emails at scaleai can take into account a customer’s history with your company and determine the type of messaging and offers that work bestfor example phrasee is an email marketing tool that uses ai to generate subject lines body copy and ctas to encourage higher clickthrough rates and engagement on email marketing campaignsartificial intelligence has the potential to make search more humanit means that search engines now look more at the meaning and the context of the searcher’s query to deliver more meaningful resultsthe era of keyword stuffing is over search algorithms are now focusing on the user’s context and search intentand this is a good thingmarketers can also leverage ai tools to improve the ranking of their contentnow you can use ai to improve your seo efforts in a variety of ways includingevery time you log into facebook and view the news feed you are seeing ai in actionfacebook is continuously monitoring who you follow what you interact with how you consume content and morethese algorithms learn over time to produce better news feed resultsfacebook is all about engagementif you spend more time on the platform they can show you more ads and they make more moneyit’s that simpleit makes total sense to track what you interact and don’t interact withif you follow a facebook page and never interact with the posts they publish that is a sure sign that you have no interest in that page’s contenthere’s another example of ai for social mediapersado provides “machinegenerated marketing copy to drive maximum performance in any channel”it picks out the best words phrases visuals and emotions to drive more engagementand social media is all about engagementwith this social media module they will automatically create the text and find the best images that will drive the most engagementconversion rate optimization is all about improving conversionfor example out of 100 visitors to your website you convert 2 and then you make changes to your website and increase your conversion to 3there are many ways to increase conversionthis is a very time consuming and manual process and this is where ai can helpunbounce is a landing page toolthey recently built a pilot project around ai and included 34 customers over a 6 week periodthe ai analyzed the performance of the landing pages on real campaigns and instructed conversion specialists on what to changeon average the increase in conversion on the pages was 198 with one page achieving over 100this is certainly a higher performance increase than you’d expect to get from working with a conversion specialistevery company out there wants to be able to capture as much of the conversations around their brand as possiblethe goal is to understand not only what people are saying about their brand products or services but also how they feel about themthis helps marketers to analyze their brand presence and use those insights to improve communication with their audience and target their campaigns betternlp and sentiment analysis can really help in this areacompanies can use ai to understand conversations around their products so they can spot potential issues and act on them as well as to uncover purchase intentwe all know how important visual content is for marketingnow we can use ai and image recognition tools to analyze trends and uncover the type of visuals that would bring the best results on social media and other channelsimage recognition allows marketers to ‘listen’ to what their audience is saying through images so they can deliver visual content that fits the interests of that audienceai can help analyze millions of social media posts and filter through the images that people share and engage withwithout image recognition tools it would be impossible for marketers to analyze this amount of visual materialone example of this is the image insights platform from brandwatch this tool is focused on helping companies uncover how people are using images that contain their brand across social mediait basically analyzes visual mentions of a brand’s logo across millions of social media postsinfluencer marketing is a very powerful form of marketing but brands find it difficult to identify the right influencerswith ai technology there are now smarter ways of analyzing and finding influencersfor exampledemand for useful content from trusted experts is taking the marketing world by storm in the form of influencer collaboration and ai is playing multiple rolesfrom ai powered virtual influencers on instagram like lilmiquela with 15 million followers to sophisticated ai systems used in influencer marketing platforms the impact and implications of artificial intelligence on influencer marketing are just beginningfuture applications of ai and influencer marketing include the ability to predict potential impact of certain influencers content types and channel combinations as well as more advanced filtering of influencers with fake followersc h a p t e r – 4in 2018 the eu brought in a regulation called gdpr global data protection regulationits goal is to regulate the collection storage and use of personal data by companies without permissionas consumers get more and more concerned with the use their personal data i expect that similar regulation will be implemented in other parts of the worldas ai is all about collecting and processing data this has serious repercussionslet’s say you walked into a supermarket and the supermarket used facial recognition to identify you and then tailored your experience based on the available data do they have the permission to do this not in europeso although ai is extremely powerful some of it’s use will need to be approvedthere is a bright future ahead of us for aiit will have a huge impact on marketing for many years to comeit will change marketing roles it will remove some of them entirely and it will provide a whole new level of sophistication which was never possible beforeshould you be concerned as a marketerof courseyou need to stay on top of developments in ai and see how you can incorporate it into your marketingyou need to think about your role as a marketer and how your role will evolve or

automatically have a right to see the data which is controlled by the employerthe insurer hiscox and the it firm cisco have used the system for shortterm analysis rather than continuous surveillance status today saidcritics say such systems risk increasing pressure on workers who fear the judgment of the algorithm and that it could encourage people not to take breaks or spend time in creative thought that will not be logged“if performance targets are being finetuned by ai and your progress towards them being measured by ai that will only multiply the pressure” said ursula huws a professor of labour and globalisation at the university of hertfordshire “people are deemed not to be working if they take their hands off the keyboard for five minutes but they could be thinking and that doesn’t get measured what is this doing for innovation which needs creative workers”she said there were risks to mental health if people did not feel free to take breaks for example to surf social media for a few minutes or play a game a survey released this week suggests uk workers tend to procrastinate for on average three hours a daythe isaak system has already gathered data on more than 1bn actions which it uses to pinpoint “central individuals within a network” to better allocate workload and responsibilities “ultimately improving the overall workplace environment and reducing stress and overworking”it is part of what experts have labelled the “precision economy” in which more and more aspects of life will be measured the royal society of arts predicts that in the next 15 years life insurance premiums will be set with data from wearable monitors and workers in retail and hospitality will be tracked for time spent inactive as gig economy working spreads people will qualify for the best jobs only with performance and empathy metrics that pass a high threshold those with lower scores will have access to only the most menial and sometimes miserable tasks such as content moderation on social media the rsa has predictedankur modi the chief executive of status today said his system aimed to provide a “wellbeing analysis” and could detect overwork – for example at evenings and weekends but he admitted “there’s always a risk that it might be misused” he agreed it was a legitimate concern that companies could use it only to boost productivity without focusing on wellbeing“if one salesperson is performing well and you can see overwork and another isn’t performing well and isn’t overworked that could be enough to start a conversation” he saidhowever he argued that it could help bosses cut out bias and discrimination by removing subjectivity from management decisionsai ideas that are being developed elsewhere have included the use of facial recognition software and mood monitoring at work recording a worker’s location on wearable devices and the monitoring of keyboard strokes a survey by the trades union congress last year found that a majority of workers were opposed to all of thesethe tuc’s general secretary frances o’grady said “workers want to be trusted to do their jobs but this kind of hightech snooping creates fear and distrust and by undermining morale it could do businesses more harm than good employers should only introduce surveillance technologies after negotiation and agreement with the workforce including union representatives there should always be a workplace agreement in place that clarifies where the line is drawn for legitimate use and that protects the privacy of working people”', 'ul': 'comments

people to rethink how we integrate information analyze data and use the resulting insights to improve decision making—and already it is transforming every walk of life in this report darrell west and john allen discuss ais application across a variety of sectors address issues in its development and offer recommendations for getting the most out of ai while still protecting important human valuestable of contents i qualities of artificial intelligence ii applications in diverse sectors iii policy regulatory and ethical issues iv recommendations v conclusionmost people are not very familiar with the concept of artificial intelligence ai as an illustration when 1500 senior business leaders in the united states in 2017 were asked about ai only 17 percent said they were familiar with it1 a number of them were not sure what it was or how it would affect their particular companies they understood there was considerable potential for altering business processes but were not clear how ai could be deployed within their own organizationsdespite its widespread lack of familiarity ai is a technology that is transforming every walk of life it is a wideranging tool that enables people to rethink how we integrate information analyze data and use the resulting insights to improve decisionmaking our hope through this comprehensive overview is to explain ai to an audience of policymakers opinion leaders and interested observers and demonstrate how ai already is altering the world and raising important questions for society the economy and governancein this paper we discuss novel applications in finance national security health care criminal justice transportation and smart cities and address issues such as data access problems algorithmic bias ai ethics and transparency and legal liability for ai decisions we contrast the regulatory approaches of the us and european union and close by making a number of recommendations for getting the most out of ai while still protecting important human values2in order to maximize ai benefits we recommend nine steps for going forwardalthough there is no uniformly agreed upon definition ai generally is thought to refer to “machines that respond to stimulation consistent with traditional responses from humans given the human capacity for contemplation judgment and intention”3 according to researchers shubhendu and vijay these software systems “make decisions which normally require a human level of expertise” and help people anticipate problems or deal with issues as they come up4 as such they operate in an intentional intelligent and adaptive mannerartificial intelligence algorithms are designed to make decisions often using realtime data they are unlike passive machines that are capable only of mechanical or predetermined responses using sensors digital data or remote inputs they combine information from a variety of different sources analyze the material instantly and act on the insights derived from those data with massive improvements in storage systems processing speeds and analytic techniques they are capable of tremendous sophistication in analysis and decisionmakingartificial intelligence is already altering the world and raising important questions for society the economy and governanceai generally is undertaken in conjunction with machine learning and data analytics5 machine learning takes data and looks for underlying trends if it spots something that is relevant for a practical problem software designers can take that knowledge and use it to analyze specific issues all that is required are data that are sufficiently robust that algorithms can discern useful patterns data can come in the form of digital information satellite imagery visual information text or unstructured dataai systems have the ability to learn and adapt as they make decisions in the transportation area for example semiautonomous vehicles have tools that let drivers and vehicles know about upcoming congestion potholes highway construction or other possible traffic impediments vehicles can take advantage of the experience of other vehicles on the road without human involvement and the entire corpus of their achieved “experience” is immediately and fully transferable to other similarly configured vehicles their advanced algorithms sensors and cameras incorporate experience in current operations and use dashboards and visual displays to present information in real time so human drivers are able to make sense of ongoing traffic and vehicular conditions and in the case of fully autonomous vehicles advanced systems can completely control the car or truck and make all the navigational decisionsai is not a futuristic vision but rather something that is here today and being integrated with and deployed into a variety of sectors this includes fields such as finance national security health care criminal justice transportation and smart cities there are numerous examples where ai already is making an impact on the world and augmenting human capabilities in significant ways6one of the reasons for the growing role of ai is the tremendous opportunities for economic development that it presents a project undertaken by pricewaterhousecoopers estimated that “artificial intelligence technologies could increase global gdp by 157 trillion a full 14 by 2030”7 that includes advances of 7 trillion in china 37 trillion in north america 18 trillion in northern europe 12 trillion for africa and oceania 09 trillion in the rest of asia outside of china 07 trillion in southern europe and 05 trillion in latin america china is making rapid strides because it has set a national goal of investing 150 billion in ai and becoming the global leader in this area by 2030meanwhile a mckinsey global institute study of china found that “ailed automation can give the chinese economy a productivity injection that would add 08 to 14 percentage points to gdp growth annually depending on the speed of adoption”8 although its authors found that china currently lags the united states and the united kingdom in ai deployment the sheer size of its ai market gives that country tremendous opportunities for pilot testing and future developmentinvestments in financial ai in the united states tripled between 2013 and 2014 to a total of 122 billion9 according to observers in that sector “decisions about loans are now being made by software that can take into account a variety of finely parsed data about a borrower rather than just a credit score and a background check”10 in addition there are socalled roboadvisers that “create personalized investment portfolios obviating the need for stockbrokers and financial advisers”11 these advances are designed to take the emotion out of investing and undertake decisions based on analytical considerations and make these choices in a matter of minutesa prominent example of this is taking place in stock exchanges where highfrequency trading by machines has replaced much of human decisionmaking people submit buy and sell orders and computers match them in the blink of an eye without human intervention machines can spot trading inefficiencies or market differentials on a very small scale and execute trades that make money according to investor instructions12 powered in some places by advanced computing these tools have much greater capacities for storing information because of their emphasis not on a zero or a one but on “quantum bits” that can store multiple values in each location13 that dramatically increases storage capacity and decreases processing timesfraud detection represents another way ai is helpful in financial systems it sometimes is difficult to discern fraudulent activities in large organizations but ai can identify abnormalities outliers or deviant cases requiring additional investigation that helps managers find problems early in the cycle before they reach dangerous levels14ai plays a substantial role in national defense through its project maven the american military is deploying ai “to sift through the massive troves of data and video captured by surveillance and then alert human analysts of patterns or when there is abnormal or suspicious activity”15 according to deputy secretary of defense patrick shanahan the goal of emerging technologies in this area is “to meet our warfighters’ needs and to increase the speed and agility of technology development and procurement”16artificial intelligence will accelerate the traditional process of warfare so rapidly that a new term has been coined hyperwarthe big data analytics associated with ai will profoundly affect intelligence analysis as massive amounts of data are sifted in near real time—if not eventually in real time—thereby providing commanders and their staffs a level of intelligence analysis and productivity heretofore unseen command and control will similarly be affected as human commanders delegate certain routine and in special circumstances key decisions to ai platforms reducing dramatically the time associated with the decision and subsequent action in the end warfare is a time competitive process where the side able to decide the fastest and move most quickly to execution will generally prevail indeed artificially intelligent intelligence systems tied to aiassisted command and control systems can move decision support and decisionmaking to a speed vastly superior to the speeds of the traditional means of waging war so fast will be this process especially if coupled to automatic decisions to launch artificially intelligent autonomous weapons systems capable of lethal outcomes that a new term has been coined specifically to embrace the speed at which war will be waged hyperwarwhile the ethical and legal debate is raging over whether america will ever wage war with artificially intelligent autonomous lethal systems the chinese and russians are not nearly so mired in this debate and we should anticipate our need to defend against these systems operating at hyperwar speeds the challenge in the west of where to position “humans in the loop” in a hyperwar scenario will ultimately dictate the west’s capacity to be competitive in this new form of conflict17just as ai will profoundly affect the speed of warfare the proliferation of zero day or zero second cyber threats as well as polymorphic malware will challenge even the most sophisticated signaturebased cyber protection this forces significant improvement to existing cyber defenses increasingly vulnerable systems are migrating and will need to shift to a layered approach to cybersecurity with cloudbased cognitive ai platforms this approach moves the community toward a “thinking” defensive capability that can defend networks through constant training on known threats this capability includes dnalevel analysis of heretofore unknown code with the possibility of recognizing and stopping inbound malicious code by recognizing a string component of the file this is how certain key usbased systems stopped the debilitating “wannacry” and “petya” virusespreparing for hyperwar and defending critical cyber networks must become a high priority because china russia north korea and other countries are putting substantial resources into ai in 2017 china’s state council issued a plan for the country to “build a domestic industry worth almost 150 billion” by 203018 as an example of the possibilities the chinese search firm baidu has pioneered a facial recognition application that finds missing people in addition cities such as shenzhen are providing up to 1 million to support ai labs that country hopes ai will provide security combat terrorism and improve speech recognition programs19 the dualuse nature of many ai algorithms will mean ai research focused on one sector of society can be rapidly modified for use in the security sector as well20ai tools are helping designers improve computational sophistication in health care for example merantix is a german company that applies deep learning to medical issues it has an application in medical imaging that “detects lymph nodes in the human body in computer tomography ct images”21 according to its developers the key is labeling the nodes and identifying small lesions or growths that could be problematic humans can do this but radiologists charge 100 per hour and may be able to carefully read only four images an hour if there were 10000 images the cost of this process would be 250000 which is prohibitively expensive if done by humanswhat deep learning can do in this situation is train computers on data sets to learn what a normallooking versus an irregularappearing lymph node is after doing that through imaging exercises and honing the accuracy of the labeling radiological imaging specialists can apply this knowledge to actual patients and determine the extent to which someone is at risk of cancerous lymph nodes since only a few are likely to test positive it is a matter of identifying the unhealthy versus healthy nodeai has been applied to congestive heart failure as well an illness that afflicts 10 percent of senior citizens and costs 35 billion each year in the united states ai tools are helpful because they “predict in advance potential challenges ahead and allocate resources to patient education sensing and proactive interventions that keep patients out of the hospital”22ai is being deployed in the criminal justice area the city of chicago has developed an aidriven “strategic subject list” that analyzes people who have been arrested for their risk of becoming future perpetrators it ranks 400000 people on a scale of 0 to 500 using items such as age criminal activity victimization drug arrest records and gang affiliation in looking at the data analysts found that youth is a strong predictor of violence being a shooting victim is associated with becoming a future perpetrator gang affiliation has little predictive value and drug arrests are not significantly associated with future criminal activity23judicial experts claim ai programs reduce human bias in law enforcement and leads to a fairer sentencing system r street institute associate caleb watney writesempirically grounded questions of predictive risk analysis play to the strengths of machine learning automated reasoning and other forms of ai one machinelearning policy simulation concluded that such programs could be used to cut crime up to 248 percent with no change in jailing rates or reduce jail populations by up to 42 percent with no increase in crime rates24however critics worry that ai algorithms represent “a secret system to punish citizens for crimes they haven’t yet committed the risk scores have been used numerous times to guide largescale roundups”25 the fear is that such tools target people of color unfairly and have not helped chicago reduce the murder wave that has plagued it in recent yearsdespite these concerns other countries are moving ahead with rapid deployment in this area in china for example companies already have “considerable resources and access to voices faces and other biometric data in vast quantities which would help them develop their technologies”26 new technologies make it possible to match images and voices with other types of information and to use ai on these combined data sets to improve law enforcement and national security through its “sharp eyes” program chinese law enforcement is matching video images social media activity online purchases travel records and personal identity into a “police cloud” this integrated database enables authorities to keep track of criminals potential lawbreakers and terrorists27 put differently china has become the world’s leading aipowered surveillance statetransportation represents an area where ai and machine learning are producing major innovations research by cameron kerry and jack karsten of the brookings institution has found that over 80 billion was invested in autonomous vehicle technology between august 2014 and june 2017 those investments include applications both for autonomous driving and the core technologies vital to that sector28autonomous vehicles—cars trucks buses and drone delivery systems—use advanced technological capabilities those features include automated vehicle guidance and braking lanechanging systems the use of cameras and sensors for collision avoidance the use of ai to analyze information in real time and the use of highperformance computing and deep learning systems to adapt to new circumstances through detailed maps29light detection and ranging systems lidars and ai are key to navigation and collision avoidance lidar systems combine light and radar instruments they are mounted on the top of vehicles that use imaging in a 360degree environment from a radar and light beams to measure the speed and distance of surrounding objects along with sensors placed on the front sides and back of the vehicle these instruments provide information that keeps fastmoving cars and trucks in their own lane helps them avoid other vehicles applies brakes and steering when needed and does so instantly so as to avoid accidentsadvanced software enables cars to learn from the experiences of other vehicles on the road and adjust their guidance systems as weather driving or road conditions change this means that software is the key—not the physical car or truck itselfsince these cameras and sensors compile a huge amount of information and need to process it instantly to avoid the car in the next lane autonomous vehicles require highperformance computing advanced algorithms and deep learning systems to adapt to new scenarios this means that software is the key not the physical car or truck itself30 advanced software enables cars to learn from the experiences of other vehicles on the road and adjust their guidance systems as weather driving or road conditions change31ridesharing companies are very interested in autonomous vehicles they see advantages in terms of customer service and labor productivity all of the major ridesharing companies are exploring driverless cars the surge of carsharing and taxi services—such as uber and lyft in the united states daimler’s mytaxi and hailo service in great britain and didi chuxing in china—demonstrate the opportunities of this transportation option uber recently signed an agreement to purchase 24000 autonomous cars from volvo for its ridesharing service32however the ridesharing firm suffered a setback in march 2018 when one of its autonomous vehicles in arizona hit and killed a pedestrian uber and several auto manufacturers immediately suspended testing and launched investigations into what went wrong and how the fatality could have occurred33 both industry and consumers want reassurance that the technology is safe and able to deliver on its stated promises unless there are persuasive answers this accident could slow ai advancements in the transportation sectormetropolitan governments are using ai to improve urban service delivery for example according to kevin desouza rashmi krishnamurthy and gregory dawsonthe cincinnati fire department is using data analytics to optimize medical emergency responses the new analytics system recommends to the dispatcher an appropriate response to a medical emergency call—whether a patient can be treated onsite or needs to be taken to the hospital—by taking into account several factors such as the type of call location weather and similar calls34since it fields 80000 requests each year cincinnati officials are deploying this technology to prioritize responses and determine the best ways to handle emergencies they see ai as a way to deal with large volumes of data and figure out efficient ways of responding to public requests rather than address service issues in an ad hoc manner authorities are trying to be proactive in how they provide urban servicescincinnati is not alone a number of metropolitan areas are adopting smart city applications that use ai to improve service delivery environmental planning resource management energy utilization and crime prevention among other things for its smart cities index the magazine fast company ranked american locales and found seattle boston san francisco washington dc and new york city as the top adopters seattle for example has embraced sustainability and is using ai to manage energy usage and resource management boston has launched a “city hall to go” that makes sure underserved communities receive needed public services it also has deployed “cameras and inductive loops to manage traffic and acoustic sensors to identify gun shots” san francisco has certified 203 buildings as meeting leed sustainability standards35through these and other means metropolitan areas are leading the country in the deployment of ai solutions indeed according to a national league of cities report 66 percent of american cities are investing in smart city technology among the top applications noted in the report are “smart meters for utilities intelligent traffic signals egovernance applications wifi kiosks and radio frequency identification sensors in pavement”36these examples from a variety of sectors demonstrate how ai is transforming many walks of human existence the increasing penetration of ai and autonomous devices into many aspects of life is altering basic operations and decisionmaking within organizations and improving efficiency and response timesat the same time though these developments raise important policy regulatory and ethical issues for example how should we promote data access how do we guard against biased or unfair data used in algorithms what types of ethical principles are introduced through software programming and how transparent should designers be about their choices what about questions of legal liability in cases where algorithms cause harm37the increasing penetration of ai into many aspects of life is altering decisionmaking within organizations and improving efficiency at the same time though these developments raise important policy regulatory and ethical issuesthe key to getting the most out of ai is having a “datafriendly ecosystem with unified standards and crossplatform sharing” ai depends on data that can be analyzed in real time and brought to bear on concrete problems having data that are “accessible for exploration” in the research community is a prerequisite for successful ai development38according to a mckinsey global institute study nations that promote open data sources and data sharing are the ones most likely to see ai advances in this regard the united states has a substantial advantage over china global ratings on data openness show that us ranks eighth overall in the world compared to 93 for china39but right now the united states does not have a coherent national data strategy there are few protocols for promoting research access or platforms that make it possible to gain new insights from proprietary data it is not always clear who owns data or how much belongs in the public sphere these uncertainties limit the innovation economy and act as a drag on academic research in the following section we outline ways to improve data access for researchersin some instances certain ai systems are thought to have enabled discriminatory or biased practices40 for example airbnb has been accused of having homeowners on its platform who discriminate against racial minorities a research project undertaken by the harvard business school found that “airbnb users with distinctly african american names were roughly 16 percent less likely to be accepted as guests than those with distinctly white names”41racial issues also come up with facial recognition software most such systems operate by comparing a person’s face to a range of faces in a large database as pointed out by joy buolamwini of the algorithmic justice league “if your facial recognition data contains mostly caucasian faces that’s what your program will learn to recognize”42 unless the databases have access to diverse data these programs perform poorly when attempting to recognize africanamerican or asianamerican featuresmany historical data sets reflect traditional values which may or may not represent the preferences wanted in a current system as buolamwini notes such an approach risks repeating inequities of the pastthe rise of automation and the increased reliance on algorithms for highstakes decisions such as whether someone get insurance or not your likelihood to default on a loan or somebody’s risk of recidivism means this is something that needs to be addressed even admissions decisions are increasingly automated—what school our children go to and what opportunities they have we don’t have to bring the structural inequalities of the past into the future we create43algorithms embed ethical considerations and value choices into program decisions as such these systems raise questions concerning the criteria used in automated decisionmaking some people want to have a better understanding of how algorithms function and what choices are being made44in the united states many urban schools use algorithms for enrollment decisions based on a variety of considerations such as parent preferences neighborhood qualities income level and demographic background according to brookings researcher jon valant the new orleans–based bricolage academy “gives priority to economically disadvantaged applicants for up to 33 percent of available seats in practice though most cities have opted for categories that prioritize siblings of current students children of school employees and families that live in school’s broad geographic area”45 enrollment choices can be expected to be very different when considerations of this sort come into playdepending on how ai systems are set up they can facilitate the redlining of mortgage applications help people discriminate against individuals they don’t like or help screen or build rosters of individuals based on unfair criteria the types of considerations that go into programming decisions matter a lot in terms of how the systems operate and how they affect customers46for these reasons the eu is implementing the general data protection regulation gdpr in may 2018 the rules specify that people have “the right to opt out of personally tailored ads” and “can contest ‘legal or similarly significant’ decisions made by algorithms and appeal for human intervention” in the form of an explanation of how the algorithm generated a particular outcome each guideline is designed to ensure the protection of personal data and provide individuals with information on how the “black box” operates47there are questions concerning the legal liability of ai systems if there are harms or infractions or fatalities in the case of driverless cars the operators of the algorithm likely will fall under product liability rules a body of case law has shown that the situation’s facts and circumstances determine liability and influence the kind of penalties that are imposed those can range from civil fines to imprisonment for major harms48 the uberrelated fatality in arizona will be an important test case for legal liability the state actively recruited uber to test its autonomous vehicles and gave the company considerable latitude in terms of road testing it remains to be seen if there will be lawsuits in this case and who is sued the human backup driver the state of arizona the phoenix suburb where the accident took place uber software developers or the auto manufacturer given the multiple people and organizations involved in the road testing there are many legal questions to be resolvedin nontransportation areas digital platforms often have limited liability for what happens on their sites for example in the case of airbnb the firm “requires that people agree to waive their right to sue or to join in any classaction lawsuit or classaction arbitration to use the service” by demanding that its users sacrifice basic rights the company limits consumer protections and therefore curtails the ability of people to fight discrimination arising from unfair algorithms49 but whether the principle of neutral networks holds up in many sectors is yet to be determined on a widespread basisin order to balance innovation with basic human values we propose a number of recommendations for moving forward with ai this includes improving data access increasing government investment in ai promoting ai workforce development creating a federal advisory committee engaging with state and local officials to ensure they enact effective policies regulating broad objectives as opposed to specific algorithms taking bias seriously as an ai issue maintaining mechanisms for human control and oversight and penalizing malicious behavior and promoting cybersecuritythe united states should develop a data strategy that promotes innovation and consumer protection right now there are no uniform standards in terms of data access data sharing or data protection almost all the data are proprietary in nature and not shared very broadly with the research community and this limits innovation and system design ai requires data to test and improve its learning capacity50 without structured and unstructured data sets it will be nearly impossible to gain the full benefits of artificial intelligencein general the research community needs better access to government and business data although with appropriate safeguards to make sure researchers do not misuse data in the way cambridge analytica did with facebook information there is a variety of ways researchers could gain data access one is through voluntary agreements with companies holding proprietary data facebook for example recently announced a partnership with stanford economist raj chetty to use its social media data to explore inequality51 as part of the arrangement researchers were required to undergo background checks and could only access data from secured sites in order to protect user privacy and securityin the us there are no uniform standards in terms of data access data sharing or data protection almost all the data are proprietary in nature and not shared very broadly with the research community and this limits innovation and system designgoogle long has made available search results in aggregated form for researchers and the general public through its “trends” site scholars can analyze topics such as interest in trump views about democracy and perspectives on the overall economy52 that helps people track movements in public interest and identify topics that galvanize the general publictwitter makes much of its tweets available to researchers through application programming interfaces commonly referred to as apis these tools help people outside the company build application software and make use of data from its social media platform they can study patterns of social media communications and see how people are commenting on or reacting to current eventsin some sectors where there is a discernible public benefit governments can facilitate collaboration by building infrastructure that shares data for example the national cancer institute has pioneered a datasharing protocol where certified researchers can query health data it has using deidentified information drawn from clinical data claims information and drug therapies that enables researchers to evaluate efficacy and effectiveness and make recommendations regarding the best medical approaches without compromising the privacy of individual patientsthere could be publicprivate data partnerships that combine government and business data sets to improve system performance for example cities could integrate information from ridesharing services with its own material on social service locations bus lines mass transit and highway congestion to improve transportation that would help metropolitan areas deal with traffic tieups and assist in highway and mass transit planningsome combination of these approaches would improve data access for researchers the government and the business community without impinging on personal privacy as noted by ian buck the vice president of nvidia “data is the fuel that drives the ai engine the federal government has access to vast sources of information opening access to that data will help us get insights that will transform the us economy”53 through its datagov portal the federal government already has put over 230000 data sets into the public domain and this has propelled innovation and aided improvements in ai and data analytic technologies54 the private sector also needs to facilitate research data access so that society can achieve the full benefits of artificial intelligenceaccording to greg brockman the cofounder of openai the us federal government invests only 11 billion in nonclassified ai technology55 that is far lower than the amount being spent by china or other leading nations in this area of research that shortfall is noteworthy because the economic payoffs of ai are substantial in order to boost economic development and social innovation federal officials need to increase investment in artificial intelligence and data analytics higher investment is likely to pay for itself many times over in economic and social benefits56as ai applications accelerate across many sectors it is vital that we reimagine our educational institutions for a world where ai will be ubiquitous and students need a different kind of training than they currently receive right now many students do not receive instruction in the kinds of skills that will be needed in an aidominated landscape for example there currently are shortages of data scientists computer scientists engineers coders and platform developers these are skills that are in short supply unless our educational system generates more people with these capabilities it will limit ai developmentfor these reasons both state and federal governments have been investing in ai human capital for example in 2017 the national science foundation funded over 6500 graduate students in computerrelated fields and has launched several new initiatives designed to encourage data and computer science at all levels from prek to higher and continuing education57 the goal is to build a larger pipeline of ai and data analytic personnel so that the united states can reap the full advantages of the knowledge revolutionbut there also needs to be substantial changes in the process of learning itself it is not just technical skills that are needed in an ai world but skills of critical reasoning collaboration design visual display of information and independent thinking among others ai will reconfigure how society and the economy operate and there needs to be “big picture” thinking on what this will mean for ethics governance and societal impact people will need the ability to think broadly about many questions and integrate knowledge from a number of different areasone example of new ways to prepare students for a digital future is ibm’s teacher advisor program utilizing watson’s free online tools to help teachers bring the latest knowledge into the classroom they enable instructors to develop new lesson plans in stem and nonstem fields find relevant instructional videos and help students get the most out of the classroom58 as such they are precursors of new educational environments that need to be createdfederal officials need to think about how they deal with artificial intelligence as noted previously there are many issues ranging from the need for improved data access to addressing issues of bias and discrimination it is vital that these and other concerns be considered so we gain the full benefits of this emerging technologyin order to move forward in this area several members of congress have introduced the “future of artificial intelligence act” a bill designed to establish broad policy and legal principles for ai it proposes the secretary of commerce create a federal advisory committee on the development and implementation of artificial intelligence the legislation provides a mechanism for the federal government to get advice on ways to promote a “climate of investment and innovation to ensure the global competitiveness of the united states” “optimize the development of artificial intelligence to address the potential growth restructuring or other changes in the united states workforce” “support the unbiased development and application of artificial intelligence” and “protect the privacy rights of individuals”59among the specific questions the committee is asked to address include the following competitiveness workforce impact education ethics training data sharing international cooperation accountability machine learning bias rural impact government efficiency investment climate job impact bias and consumer impact the committee is directed to submit a report to congress and the administration 540 days after enactment regarding any legislative or administrative action needed on aithis legislation is a step in the right direction although the field is moving so rapidly that we would recommend shortening the reporting timeline from 540 days to 180 days waiting nearly two years for a committee report will certainly result in missed opportunities and a lack of action on important issues given rapid advances in the field having a much quicker turnaround time on the committee analysis would be quite beneficialstates and localities also are taking action on ai for example the new york city council unanimously passed a bill that directed the mayor to form a taskforce that would “monitor the fairness and validity of algorithms used by municipal agencies”60 the city employs algorithms to “determine if a lower bail will be assigned to an indigent defendant where firehouses are established student placement for public schools assessing teacher performance identifying medicaid fraud and determine where crime will happen next”61according to the legislation’s developers city officials want to know how these algorithms work and make sure there is sufficient ai transparency and accountability in addition there is concern regarding the fairness and biases of ai algorithms so the taskforce has been directed to analyze these issues and make recommendations regarding future usage it is scheduled to report back to the mayor on a range of ai policy legal and regulatory issues by late 2019some observers already are worrying that the taskforce won’t go far enough in holding algorithms accountable for example julia powles of cornell tech and new york university argues that the bill originally required companies to make the ai source code available to the public for inspection and that there be simulations of its decisionmaking using actual data after criticism of those provisions however former councilman james vacca dropped the requirements in favor of a task force studying these issues he and other city officials were concerned that publication of proprietary information on algorithms would slow innovation and make it difficult to find ai vendors who would work with the city62 it remains to be seen how this local task force will balance issues of innovation privacy and transparencythe european union has taken a restrictive stance on these issues of data collection and analysis63 it has rules limiting the ability of companies from collecting data on road conditions and mapping street views because many of these countries worry that people’s personal information in unencrypted wifi networks are swept up in overall data collection the eu has fined technology firms demanded copies of data and placed limits on the material collected64 this has made it more difficult for technology companies operating there to develop the highdefinition maps required for autonomous vehiclesthe gdpr being implemented in europe place severe restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning according to published guidelines “regulations prohibit any automated decision that ‘significantly affects’ eu citizens this includes techniques that evaluates a person’s ‘performance at work economic situation health personal preferences interests reliability behavior location or movements’”65 in addition these new rules give citizens the right to review how digital services made specific algorithmic choices affecting peopleby taking a restrictive stance on issues of data collection and analysis the european union is putting its manufacturers and software designers at a significant disadvantage to the rest of the worldif interpreted stringently these rules will make it difficult for european software designers and american designers who work with european counterparts to incorporate artificial intelligence and highdefinition mapping in autonomous vehicles central to navigation in these cars and trucks is tracking location and movements without highdefinition maps containing geocoded data and the deep learning that makes use of this information fully autonomous driving will stagnate in europe through this and other data protection actions the european union is putting its manufacturers and software designers at a significant disadvantage to the rest of the worldit makes more sense to think about the broad objectives desired in ai and enact policies that advance them as opposed to governments trying to crack open the “black boxes” and see exactly how specific algorithms operate regulating individual algorithms will limit innovation and make it difficult for companies to make use of artificial intelligencebias and discrimination are serious issues for ai there already have been a number of cases of unfair treatment linked to historic data and steps need to be undertaken to make sure that does not become prevalent in artificial intelligence existing statutes governing discrimination in the physical economy need to be extended to digital platforms that will help protect consumers and build confidence in these systems as a wholefor these advances to be widely adopted more transparency is needed in how ai systems operate andrew burt of immuta argues “the key problem confronting predictive analytics is really transparency we’re in a world where data science operations are taking on increasingly important tasks and the only thing holding them back is going to be how well the data scientists who train the models can explain what it is their models are doing”66some individuals have argued that there needs to be avenues for humans to exercise oversight and control of ai systems for example allen institute for artificial intelligence ceo oren etzioni argues there should be rules for regulating these systems first he says ai must be governed by all the laws that already have been developed for human behavior including regulations concerning “cyberbullying stock manipulation or terrorist threats” as well as “entrapping people into committing crimes” second he believes that these systems should disclose they are automated systems and not human beings third he states “an ai system cannot retain or disclose confidential information without explicit approval from the source of that information”67 his rationale is that these tools store so much data that people have to be cognizant of the privacy risks posed by aiin the same vein the ieee global initiative has ethical guidelines for ai and autonomous systems its experts suggest that these models be programmed with consideration for widely accepted human norms and rules for behavior ai algorithms need to take into effect the importance of these norms how norm conflict can be resolved and ways these systems can be transparent about norm resolution software designs should be programmed for “nondeception” and “honesty” according to ethics experts when failures occur there must be mitigation mechanisms to deal with the consequences in particular ai must be sensitive to problems such as bias discrimination and fairness68a group of machine learning experts claim it is possible to automate ethical decisionmaking using the trolley problem as a moral dilemma they ask the following question if an autonomous car goes out of control should it be programmed to kill its own passengers or the pedestrians who are crossing the street they devised a “votingbased system” that asked 13 million people to assess alternative scenarios summarized the overall choices and applied the overall perspective of these individuals to a range of vehicular possibilities that allowed them to automate ethical decisionmaking in ai algorithms taking public preferences into account69 this procedure of course does not reduce the tragedy involved in any kind of fatality such as seen in the uber case but it provides a mechanism to help ai developers incorporate ethical considerations in their planningas with any emerging technology it is important to discourage malicious treatment designed to trick software or use it for undesirable ends70 this is especially important given the dualuse aspects of ai where the same tool can be used for beneficial or malicious purposes the malevolent use of ai exposes individuals and organizations to unnecessary risks and undermines the virtues of the emerging technology this includes behaviors such as hacking manipulating algorithms compromising privacy and confidentiality or stealing identities efforts to hijack ai in order to solicit confidential information should be seriously penalized as a way to deter such actions71in a rapidly changing world with many entities having advanced computing capabilities there needs to be serious attention devoted to cybersecurity countries have to be careful to safeguard their own systems and keep other nations from damaging their security72 according to the us department of homeland security a major american bank receives around 11 million calls a week at its service center in order to protect its telephony from denial of service attacks it uses a “machine learningbased policy engine that blocks more than 120000 calls per month based on voice firewall policies including harassing callers robocalls and potential fraudulent calls”73 this represents a way in which machine learning can help defend technology systems from malevolent attacksto summarize the world is on the cusp of revolutionizing many sectors through artificial intelligence and data analytics there already are significant deployments in finance national security health care criminal justice transportation and smart cities that have altered decisionmaking business models risk mitigation and system performance these developments are generating substantial economic and social benefitsthe world is on the cusp of revolutionizing many sectors through artificial intelligence but the way ai systems are developed need to be better understood due to the major implications these technologies will have for society as a wholeyet the manner in which ai systems unfold has major implications for society as a whole it matters how policy issues are addressed ethical conflicts are reconciled legal realities are resolved and how much transparency is required in ai and data analytic solutions74 human choices about software development affect the way in which decisions are made and the manner in which they are integrated into organizational routines exactly how these processes are executed need to be better understood because they will have substantial impact on the general public soon and for the foreseeable future ai may well be a revolution in human affairs and become the single most influential human innovation in historynote we appreciate the research assistance of grace gilberg jack karsten hillary schaub and kristjan

against humanity while a few—folks from a more positive thinking community—are envisioning a bright future where ai serves them in all possible ways from walking a dog early in the morning when the weather is unpleasant to peeling tangerines at christmaswhile the second scenario is certainly fun it is a utopia per se a reality with robots rising up against people however is a much more probable eventif you believe ai will soon become the greatest existential threat to humanity we’ve got some good news for you elon musk and stephen hawking share your point of view what a way to boost your selfesteem rightjokes aside the debate within the global tech community is not centered on the impact of humanlike ai—as the general public thinks—but rather on the possibility of ever achieving this technology outright professionals are absorbed in discussions about how to define “humanlike” and “intelligence” these definitions may seem trivial to outsiders but understanding the human mind and intelligence are in fact critical to determining the timeline of milestones for ai experts are still not certain how this kind of intelligence will manifest or how soon day x will come but it is clear that we are moving towards this reality with increasing speedthis means it is high time to finally understand what ai is all aboutfirst things first before digging deeper into the topic of ai let’s briefly discuss what artificial intelligence is and how it worksthe term “artificial intelligence” dates back to 1956 and belongs to a stanford researcher john mccarthy who coined the term and defined the key mission of ai as a subfield of computer sciencebasically artificial intelligence ai is the ability of a machine or a computer program to think and learn the concept of ai is based on the idea of building machines capable of thinking acting and learning like humansa more nuanced definition is that artificial intelligence is an interdisciplinary concept that studies the possibility of creating machines capable of interacting with their environment and acting upon the received data in the a manner considered intelligentwhile some people falsely consider ai a technology the more accurate approach would be seeing it as a broad concept in which machines are able to deal with tasks in a way we would call intelligent or smartthere are certain things a machinecomputer program must be capable of to be considered aifirst it should be able to mimic human thought process and behavior second it should act in a humanlike way—intelligent rational and ethicalit is worth mentioning that the ai concept relates both to weak ai and general ai that has cognitive functions stanford has outlined a helpful ai faq on these topicsnot really although the two terms are often used interchangeably they are not the sameartificial intelligence is a broader concept while machine learning is the most common application of aiwe should understand machine learning as a current application of ai that is focused on development of computer programs that can access data and learn from it automatically without human assistance or intervention the entire machine learning concept is based on the assumption that we should give machines access to information and let them learn from it themselvesartificial intelligence in its turn is a bunch of technologies that include machine learning and some other technologies like natural language processing inference algorithms neural networks etcmany people associate ai with the distant future they incorrectly believe that despite all the buzz around artificial intelligence the technology is not likely to become a part of their lives anytime soon little do they know how many aspects of their lives are already affected by aitake siri or alexa—personal assistants that have already become the new normal for thousands of people around the globe these and similar intelligent gadgets are able to recognize our speech read “understand what we want or need” analyze the information they have access to and provide an answer or solution what is remarkable and a little scary about such assistants is that they continuously learn about their users until the point at which they are able to accurately anticipate users’ needsspotify pandora and apple music are some other touching points between ai and you these services are capable of recommending music based on your interests these apps monitor the choices you make insert them into a learning algorithm and suggest music you are most likely to enjoy this particular use of ai is probably one of the simplest among all but it does a good job helping us discover new songs and artistsai is making headway in areas you might least expect it for example when you come across short news stories on the associated press or yahoo chances are good they were written by ai the current state of artificial intelligence already allows for some basic robot writing it might be not yet ready to compose indepth articles or creative stories but does a pretty good job writing short and simple articles like sport recaps and financial summariesother examples of artificial intelligence in use today include smart home devices like google’s nest selfdriving cars like those produced by tesla and online games like alien isolationhere at stopad we rely on artificial intelligence toothanks to the ai we’ve developed our ad blocker is able to detect ads just like a human does this means identifying and blocking ads regardless of their placement size type and format stopad is even capable of identifying native advertising—ads designed to mimic the structure and layout of the website they appear on furthermore we sometimes use ai to conduct our own investigationssome people claim that ai is still in its infancy others assure us that we are only a few years away from ai gaining control over humanity the truth however lies somewhere in betweenaccording to the most trustworthy forecasts out there ai will outsmart humans at virtually everything in the following 45 years obviously this won’t happen overnight industries will be falling under ai’s spell onebyoneexperts predict that within the next decade ai will outperform humans in relatively simple tasks such as translating languages writing school essays and driving trucks more complicated tasks like writing a bestselling book or working as a surgeon however will take machines much more time to learn ai is expected to master these two skills by 2049 and 2053 accordinglyit is obviously too soon to talk about aipowered creatures like those from westworld or ex machina stealing our jobs or worse yet rising against humanity but we are certainly moving in that direction meanwhile top tech professionals and scientists are getting increasingly concerned about our future and encourage further research on the potential impact of aiit looks like those who understand the full potential of ai are more scared of it than those who only know the basics a recent scandal between google’s executives and employees may serve as a proof in april employees of google demanded the company to stop working on a socalled “pentagon project” as they were afraid of being involved in the business of war the project officially known as “project maven” is meant to use ai to make it easier to classify images of people and objects shot by drones the potential danger is that the lifeordeath decisions of what needs to be bombarded and what doesn’t will be made without humans involvementthe military explains that their only intent is to reduce the current workload and minimize the number of tedious tasks performed by humans—something ai is extremely wellsuited forgiven that lives of people might be at stake however can these tasks even be called tedious and there’s another critical question in a world like this who will bear the blame of killing innocent peopleit is a widespread point of view that one day not only will ai exceed human performance but it will also extend beyond human control with so many fearful articles out there questions like “is artificial intelligence safe” or “is artificial intelligence bad for people” should come as no surprise ai is obviously exciting but simultaneously warrants cautiongiven the innate advantage ai machines have over us humans accuracy speed etc an ai rebellion scenario is something we should not completely dismiss time will show us whether ai is our greatest existential threat or a tech blessing that will improve our quality of life in many different waysso far one thing remains perfectly clear creating ai is one of the most remarkable events for humankind after all ai is considered a major component of 4th industrial revolution and its potential socioeconomic impact is believed to be as huge as the invention of electricity once hadin light of this the smartest approach would be keeping an eye on how the technology evolves taking advantage of the improvements it brings to our lives and not getting too nervous at the thought of machine takeoverstopad is the most effective and easytouse ad

intelligence in medicine offers humans a chance at better healthcare with more efficiency and precisionimage via pr newswireaccording to peter szolovits professor at mit and author of the book artificial intelligence and medicine two approaches used to enable computers to diagnose patients are flowchart and databasesflowchart also known as the “branching tree” is an example of an expert system where a “knowledge engineer” interviews an expert and translates his or her knowledge into a computer program in the field of medicine the flowchart simulates the process of a physician asking a series of questions to a patient arriving at certain diagnoses and treatments this system works by programming “if… then…” rules that include probable answers and possible diagnosesthis one can imagine requires a large amount of data consider the number of possible symptoms vs a wide range of illnesses success may also be limited as computers cannot obtain certain information that is available during human interaction between a physician and a patient the doctor’s knowledge of the patient’s background aids him in coming up with better questions than a computerthe database approach on the other hand works through what is called “deep learning” or patternmatching by repetitively teaching the computer what a certain image is called the system hones its algorithm and becomes faster and more efficient in identifying that image this approach requires massive amounts of data eg in your facebook account the platform is able to detect facial features of a certain person even if the photo has disappearedimage via the huffington posthumanity has been enjoying the benefits of artificial intelligence in medicine for several decades—even shortly after the ai study began here are just a few examples of man and machine coming together in the world of medicinedecision support systems dxplain was developed at the university of massachusetts in 1987 given a set of symptoms dxplain comes up with a list of possible diagnoses which might be related to the selected symptomslaboratory information systems developed by washington university germwatcher is designed to detect track and investigate infections in hospitalized patients this aims to lessen the cases of hospitalacquired infections by monitoring a hospital’s laboratory system identifying the microbiology culture it finds and reporting the results to the us national center for disease control and preventionrobotic surgical systems in the da vinci robotic surgical system the doctor’s hand movements are translated into the machine’s robotic arms precise movement and magnified vision allow the doctor to perform surgery with very tiny incisions and see inside the body in 3d the very pinnacle of artificial intelligence in medicinetherapy it is now possible to get treatment for social anxiety by logging in to ai therapy—an online course that provides patients with guidance on how to identify the causes of their anxiety and a list of resources customized to their needsreducing human error in diagnosis artificial intelligence in medicine is shown in babylon is an online application that patients in the uk use to book their doctor appointments and routine tests what makes it even more special is that patients have an option to consult with a doctor online as well as check for symptoms get advice monitor their health and order test kitsmedical education the auscultation assistant is an online platform that familiarizes medical students with certain heart sounds to hone their diagnosis skillsimage via ai magazinewhat does the future hold for artificial intelligence in medicine the trend seems to be that the better the technology the more specific tasks ai can perform both accurately and efficientlyidentifying tumors and symptoms of heart disease ibm’s watson software is being developed to identify symptoms of cancer and heart disease for this to be possible watson will need a very large data base of images that will train it on what certain symptoms look like in this development ibm is acquiring merge healthcare—a company that has collected billions of medical scans and images from 8000 hospitals—to use for watson’s training in accurately and efficiently identifying symptoms of cancer and heart illnesses if the software is successful experts are hoping that it would not only identify symptoms but also spot symptoms that physicians could otherwise missimproving healthcare information systems stanford university is currently working on its program in aiassisted care pac systems that will make healthcare support much easier for clinicians one of the programs in pac is the intelligent senior wellbeing support system which makes remote monitoring possible for seniors who live alone multiple sensors will be utilized not only to detect movement and behavioral patterns but also to assess and respond to situations that need attentionpac is also developing smart icus to make it easier for clinicians to detect pain and changes in the patientcaliforniabased sensely on the other hand is developing molly a virtual nurse who provides monitoring and followup care to patients after they have been discharged from the hospital this solution saves doctors a great amount of time that they can use to attend to other patientsat mit the computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail is leveling up the function that robots can do in hospitals through “apprenticeship scheduling” here the robots learn through demonstration how a scheduler assigns nurses and rooms for patients in a busy ward this technology the nurses admit would be a great help in distributing the workload and give them more time for attending to patientsartificial intelligence in medicine offers great promise in the fields development when it usually takes billions of funds and 15 years of work to develop an effective drug using its powerful set of data atomwise will be able to develop new medicines much faster while discovering ways to use old drugs it offers a more costeffective approach to designing and developing medicines that will inevitably help drive down their expensesimage via medical futuristin may 2016 the us national economic council in partnership with academic and nongovernment organizations conducted a workshop on the “legal implications of artificial intelligence” the government’s goal is to acknowledge the bigger role that ai will play in people’s lives it is meant to encourage discussions that will help the government create the appropriate policies and regulations to protect aspects of national importance such as employment security and safetyrobert wachter author of the digital doctor hope hype and harm at the dawn of medicines computer age cautions that unless we—humans—improve ourselves there will be casualties that come along with the advancement of artificial intelligence in medicine hospitals that could not afford to invest in aipowered machines would have tight competition with those who could lose patients and eventually shut down in the long run hospitals would also have to make do with less staff in order to avoid redundancy in their resourcesas the babylon app has shown ai can change the consulting behavior of patients by replacing a trip to the clinic with the online systemoffering a different and optimistic point of view on the future of aim is anil jain md an executive at explorys which provides about 50 billion medical records and billing information to the watson project instead of saying ai stands for artificial intelligence he proposes we should think of it as augmented intelligence it starts with data but it ends with insights that transform the organization”’a

proactive strategies have higher profit margins and expect the performance gap with other firms to widen in the next three yearsthis adoption pattern is widening a gap between digitized early adopters and others sectors at the top of mgi’s industry digitization index such as high tech and telecoms or financial services are also leading ai adopters and have the most ambitious ai investment plans

cars face recognition web search industrial robots missile guidance and tumor detection have in commonthey are all complex real world problems being solved with applications of intelligence aithis course will provide a broad understanding of the basic techniques for building intelligent computer systems and an understanding of how ai is applied to problemsyou will learn about the history of ai intelligent agents statespace problem representations uninformed and heuristic search game playing logical agents and constraint satisfaction problemshands on experience will be gained by building a basic search agent adversarial search will be explored through the creation of a game and an introduction to machine learning includes work on linear regressionthis course is part of a micromastersâ® program if you complete all courses in the micromastersâ® program in 2018 ge will guarantee you an interview in boston for an internship or fulltime role open to massachusetts residents onlymaster the essentials of machine learning and algorithms to help improve learning from data without human interventionmachine learning is the basis for the most exciting careers in data analysis today youâ\x80\x99ll learn the models and methods and apply them to real world situations ranging from identifying trending news topics to building recommendation engines ranking sports teams and plotting the path of movie zombiestopics include classification and regression clustering methods sequential models matrix factorization topic modeling and model selectionmethods include linear and logistic regression support vector machines tree classifiers boosting maximum likelihood and map inference em algorithm hidden markov models kalman filters kmeans gaussian mixture models among othersin the first half of the course we will cover supervised learning techniques for regression and classification in this framework we possess an output or response that we wish to predict based on a set of inputs we will discuss several fundamental methods for performing this task and algorithms for their optimization our approach will be more practically motivated meaning we will fully develop a mathematical understanding of the respective algorithms but we will only briefly touch on abstract learning theoryin the second half of the course we shift to unsupervised learning techniques in these problems the end goal less clearcut than predicting an output based on a corresponding input we will cover three fundamental problems of unsupervised learning data clustering matrix factorization and sequential models for orderdependent data some applications of these models include object recommendation and topic modelinglearn the core techniques for representing robots that perform physical tasks in the real worldwe think of robotics as the science of building devices that physically interact with their environment the most useful robots do it precisely powerfully repeatedly tirelessly fast or some combinations of these the most interesting robots maybe even do it intelligently this course will cover the fundamentals of robotics focusing on both the mind and the bodywe will learn about two core robot classes kinematic chains robot arms and mobile bases for both robot types we will introduce methods to reason about 3dimensional space and relationships between coordinate frames for robot arms we will use these to model the task of delivering a payload to a specified location for mobile robots we will introduce concepts for autonomous navigation in the presence of obstaclesclass projects will make use of ros the opensource robot operating system wwwrosorg widely used in both research and industry computer requirements for working on the projects will include a computer set up with ubuntu linux and high bandwidth internet access for downloading and installing ros packageslearn the science behind movie animation from the director of columbiaâ\x80\x99s

operating system design including detailed case studies of unixlinux and windows 2000 what makes an operating system modern according to author andrew tanenbaum it is the awareness of highdemand computer applicationsprimarily in the areas of multimedia parallel and distributed computing and security the development of faster and more advanced hardware has driven progress in software including enhancements to the operating system it is one thing to run an old operating system on current hardware and another to effectively leverage current hardware to best serve modern software applications if you dont believe it install windows 30 on a modern pc and try surfing the internet or burning a cd readers familiar with tanenbaums previous text operating systems know the author is a great proponent of simple design and handson experimentation his earlier book came bundled with the source code for an operating system called minux a simple variant of unix and the platform used by linus torvalds to develop linux although this book does not come with any source code he illustrates many of his points with code fragments c usually with unix system calls the first half of modern operating systems focuses on traditional operating systems concepts processes deadlocks memory management io and file systems there is nothing groundbreaking in these early chapters but all topics are well covered each including sections on current research and a set of student problems it is enlightening to read tanenbaums explanations of the design decisions made by past operating systems gurus including his view that additional research on the problem of deadlocks is impractical except for quotkeeping otherwise unemployed graph theorists off the streetsquot it is the second half of the book that differentiates itself from older operating systems texts here each chapter describes an element of what constitutes a modern operating systemawareness of multimedia applications multiple processors computer networks and a high level of security the chapter on multimedia functionality focuses on such features as handling massive files and providing videoondemand included in the discussion on multiprocessor platforms are clustered computers and distributed computing finally the importance of security is discusseda lively enumeration of the scores of ways operating systems can be vulnerable to attack from password security to computer viruses and internet worms included at the end of the book are case studies of two popular operating systems unixlinux and windows 2000 there is a bias toward the unixlinux approach not surprising given the authors experience and academic bent but this bias does not detract from tanenbaums analysis both operating systems are dissected describing how each implements processes file systems memory management and other operating system fundamentals tanenbaums mantra is simple accessible operating system design given that modern operating systems have extensive features he is forced to reconcile physical size with simplicity toward this end he makes frequent references to the frederick brooks classic the mythical manmonth for wisdom on managing large complex software development projects he finds both windows 2000 and unixlinux guilty of being too complicatedwith a particular skewering of windows 2000 and its quotmammoth win32 apiquot a primary culprit is the attempt to make operating systems more quotuserfriendlyquot which tanenbaum views as an excuse for bloated code the solution is to have smart people the smallest possible team and welldefined interactions between various operating systems components future operating system design will benefit if the advice in this book is taken to heart pete ostensonspann a

activities can be viewed as two facets of the same field and together they have undergone substantial development over the past ten years in particular bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic models also the practical applicability of bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced through the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational bayes and expectation propagation similarly new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications this new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning it is aimed at advanced undergraduates or firstyear phd students as well as researchers and practitioners and assumes no previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts knowledge of multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required and some familiarity with probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a selfcontained

played by different approaches to dealing with time in computational models objects with state concurrent programming functional programming and lazy evaluation and nondeterministic programming there

opportunitya chatbot that answers consumers’ questions and directs them to the appropriate place or person is a common example of artificial intelligence ai and one most people have experienced personally but it’s just one way to apply ai technologiesai can predict when a key sensor in a machine needs to be replaced to avoid a manufacturing line shutdown or can be used in emergency braking systems to prevent robots from significantly damaging their own components it can forecast when units will sell out highlight and respond to patterns in supply chains and even identify risk factors in investments based on a business’s loan repayment behavior and credit usagecommon definitions of ai focus on automation and as a result often fail to make clear the opportunities available to it and business leadersaipowered applications can assist healthcare providers with diagnosis and search images for early cancer detection the technology can find key factual law passages and pinpoint how lawyers have used them in other cases dissect how certain judges think write and rule and assist in mediation it even knows when to change character voices while reading a children’s book“look at how you are using technology today during critical interactions with customers — business moments — and consider how the value of those moments could be increased” says whit andrews distinguished vice president analyst at gartner “then apply ai to those points for additional business value”gartner defines ai as applying advanced analysis and logicbased techniques including machine learning to interpret events support and automate decisions and take actioncommon definitions of ai focus on automation and as a result often fail to make clear the opportunities available to it and business leaders ai is technology that emulates human performance typically by learning from itlook for critical business points where human interaction or human expertise adds valuethe most common mistake with ai is to focus on automation rather than augmentation of human decision making and interactions if cios focus only on further automation via ai they miss the hidden opportunities for greater personalization and differentiation ai can augment humans as it can classify information and make predictions faster and at higher volumes than humans can accomplish on their owncios should look for critical business points where human interaction or human expertise adds value they should find examples where such value is manifested in very large amounts of data especially where the data includes the outcomes that they desire to affect — where customer interactions record whether the customer’s experience was positive whether a purchaser added an item to a cart or whether a brake disc was revealed to be worn the predicted amount they then should consider how ai might augment those efforts to create even more valueai technology covers a wide range of potential use cases across industries typically common ai applications analyze contextual interaction data combined with historical data in real timehere are nextgeneration examples of use casesread more how to build a business case for aitypically ai is used to enhance existing applications and processes for example it might automate decisions or classify complex data both of these examples would traditionally require human intervention and consequently increased costs but ai enables the enterprise to accelerate the processto establish a strategy measure your organization against the ai maturity model this model can be used as a framework to identify where your organization is on the potential growth curve communicate with management and decide what steps need to be taken no matter where your organization is on the map and how far it has to go ensure that strategies are highly adaptive with ample room for experimentationai is complicated and many enterprises are still figuring out how to implement and gain value from the technology organizations can fall anywhere on the maturity model with most currently in the awareness phase and a handful in the transformational phasewhen asked about top barriers to ai enterprises cited finding use cases and defining strategy securityprivacy risks and integration complexity nearly two of three organizations cited finding a starting point as a concernthis plays out further when considering expected ai project timelines versus actual project timelines most organizations start an ai project with a plan to launch the project within two years however organizations past the initial planning process estimate it will take four yearsorganizations need to set realistic timelines for ai projects and ensure the desire to push forward with a popular technology doesn’t overrule realistic drawbacks and planning the hype itself can be a problem alongside other logistical and strategic challengesai projects face unique obstacles due to their scope and popularity misperceptions about their value the nature of the data they touchfurther it is difficult to determine an ai project’s roi because most organizations are too early in the process to see any return most roi will be seen in cost reduction and efficiency as that’s how ai is currently used however as enterprises evolve their ai expectations and projects the technology will mature to have more transformative and strategic impacts“ai projects face unique obstacles due to their scope and popularity misperceptions about their value the nature of the data they touch and cultural concerns” says

adapt to their environments and react to interference plants do the same human intelligence however is in an entirely different ball park with the uprise of technology and advancements constantly being made it has now come time to question the use of artificial intelligence artificial intelligence or ai means giving non living things such as computers and robots the ability to think for themselves to an extent what would this mean for the future would the economy society and the world as we know it change for the better or worseno breaks one of the biggest benefits to using machines with some level of artificial intelligence is that they could be utilized to do necessary jobs more efficiently machines do not need to take breaks in the way that humans do they do not need to sleep eat or use the restroom this would allow businesses to produce goods twenty four hours a day 365 days a yearinhumane circumstances artificial intelligence has allowed many avenues in research and exploration to develop and advance that would not have if it did not exist this is especially true with space exploration the satellites and rovers that are being sent in to space all of the time can stay there forever and continue to reach further and further out into our solar system giving us a much better understanding of what lays in the beyondno emotional barriers intelligent machines do not have emotions this is greatly beneficial because nothing interferes with their ability to perform the task they were designed to do this is completely untrue with humans many people find it difficult to work under very stressful conditions or during times of traumacost efficient machines do not need to receive a paycheck every month while they are quite costly to maintain and power this cost is greatly less than what an entire company full of human employees would have to be paid the costs are also minimized and controlledjob loss with the introduction of machines that can complete human’s jobs quicker more accurate and cheaper the rate of jobs lost is climbing ever since the introduction of factory machines people have been losing jobs to technologiespersonal connections another large concern to think about when it comes to artificial intelligence is their lack of compassion and sympathy if these robots are introduced into fields such as healthcare how can we ensure the patients and customers comfort sure they can be programmed to care but it is not genuineloss of information we have seen it time and time again and probably even experienced it once or twice information being lost due to machine damages the majority of our documents videos and images are all stored on computers phones and other forms of technology many things can cause this information to be lost in an instant and also non retrievable this could pose very large problems if artificial intelligence is implemented in areas such as banks or healthcareevolved it may seem like a science fiction movie but what would really happen if these artificially intelligent machines began to think for themselves literally it could pose major security risks but it sure does make a great story linetechnology and

processing units xilinxs nasdaqxlnx field programmable gate arrays or their own customized chips to train machinelearning models to recognize a variety of different inputs this method of training neural networks is the technical reason teslas autonomous cars can recognize stop signs and facebooks social network can recognize facesbut were reaching an exciting and strange new era which is based on a process called machinelearning inference different than training inference involves computers taking everything weve taught them to produce something entirely newartificial intelligence is gaining traction globally image source getty imagestake this site as an example it shows highresolution pictures of normallooking people who could easily be your coworkers or live next doorbut the catch is none of these people actually exist each of the pictures is fake artificially created by a generative adversarial network that has been trained on what eyes noses and hair tend to look like ai has created something on its own based on everything weve taught itthis same concept of machine inference is what allows google nasdaqgoogl duplex to make appointments for you or for amazon nasdaqamzn alexa to proactively make products recommendations for youbehind the scenes inference takes a ton of computing horsepower to actually work amazon web services estimates that inference can account for up to 90 of the computing costs required for any given applicationin other words we need to innovate computing hardware we cant just run everything on intels central processing units cpus any more at least without running up a huge electricity bill for all the power consumed the race is on to design new chips and software ecosystems that can run inference most efficientlyto help us see what the future holds i recently spoke with ibm nyseibm fellow and chief agitator john cohn john has one of the most innovative computing minds on the planet with more than 116 patents and 36 technical papers to his name after nearly 40 years at one of the worlds largest companiesin our conversation at austins south by southwest conference john discusses why and how artificial intelligence became so popular and the growing role of ai accelerators he also explains why he is a fan of using field programmable gate arrays fpgas for innovation but of custom silicon chips for highervolume commercial applicationsour conversation is captured in the following video with a full transcript also included belowibm fellow john cohn well let me just say that im a big fan of hardware i came from that and its very interestingwhen we were talking before about how the cloud was about to take over the world well like many things the actual truth is somewhere between theres going to be a rebalancing between local hardware and cloud hardware on both of those sides theres going to be a lot of advances in technology silicon technology which is kind of like after moores law things were starting to level outwell theres a lot more work in architecture about acceleration etc like gpus tpus we just announced a billiondollar investment in albany on a group thats actually looking at technology approaches to aimotley fool explorer lead advisor simon erickson an accelerator youre saying executing the code more efficiently and quicklyjohn cohn when you say code you look at a structure like a gpu gpus work for ai because in a neural net lets say in deep learning youre just doing a whole lot of linear algebra youre doing a whole bunch of multipliers thats basically it the same thing that makes graphics really smooth for a game actually is just doing a lot of matrix multipliesso in 2012 when somebody said hey lets try using commercial gpus well it was a combination of using things like cuda but then building layers on top of it whether it was pytorch tensorflow octave whatever to be able to free you up from the gorp of actually writing the cuda code yourself thats when ai and deep learning started to take offthose accelerators thats great except the sort of amount of computation you can do with a certain amount of time and a certain power budget because ultimately youve got to fit it all in the same box its getting limited because gpus were not designed to do that now a lot of companies including us are working on more special purpose accelerators socalled tpusbut were even looking beyond that im about to install a hardware cluster at mit thats about 112 kilowatts its a lot of power our human brain is about 20 watts when youre sitting there theres a lot of room to improvethis place in albany is looking at all sorts of acceleration technology were looking at analog technologies were looking at phase change memory mram to be able to do analog computing on these models of neural netsnot necessarily to run code linear code like you would do on a gpu but to actually do the analog calculation that a neuron model would do in analog with less precision but a whole lot less power a whole lot less power can be because of parallelism can be traded into a whole lot more performance or a whole lot bigger modelnow you asked about fpgas theyre different strokes for different folks right youve got to figure out what youre trying to doim a huge believer in fpgas as a technology for doing innovation one of the keyest things that you need to do is you need in that notion of being able to play with something you need to be able to make very quick turns of innovation you need to try some run real workloads on it representative set and then make some changessimon erickson what do you need to make the changes to thoughjohn cohn to the actual architecture so if youre really trying to optimize power performance which is a box how much performance can i get within a certain power budget thats basically what its all about that is tuning for many years we just tuned the software and the hardware was what it was well we cant really afford to do that now when the next turn of the crank doesnt give us more performance on hardware as you said rightso what we have to do is we have to be able to really cooptimize the software layers and the hardware layers a lot more almost like the early days of hardware almost when the days when you could count your memory bits you had to really really care where every picowatt was goingwhen youre trying to do that you create a computation structure like well do i do that in 64 bits or do it in 32 bits or do i even do it in eight bits certain calculations in image recognition are actually far faster and far more power efficient in lower resolution with the same accuracy go figure rightwell the only way to create a hardware acceleration of that is to be able to radically change the architecture of the accelerator to do that as a chip cycle could take many millions of dollars and four months or three to six months of making a new chip well you cant really afford to do thatsimon erickson yeahjohn cohn fpgas are a rapid prototyping i can get near custom hardware performance but in a day i can make a changeas a deployment technology like if you were going to go make a deep learning thing its a kind of diminishing return at some point you spend so much more money and you really get hit for cost density and power that if youve got any sort of volume at all once youve tuned it in it makes sense to do a chip if you have a very small niche something that you dont need very many of then the actual complexities the cost and risk complexities of actually building a custom chip may not be a good idea if its very special purpose im just recognizing one specific sort of image and i need to accelerate it because im doing something real time then an fpga might make sense but if you have any sort of volume i personally think that you need to go to a custom chipwhats interesting too is that there are hybrids between whats a standard fpga which can emulate any sort of logic and fieldprogrammable combinations of higher functions youll see things that are actually higherlevel composable units that you could customize somewhat but dont have the overhead of making the individual logic units in fpgassimon erickson best of both worldsjohn cohn yeah and thats kind of a balance ultimately look at something like bitcoin mining you eventually had to go to and im not a big fan of bitcoin mining but you have to eventually go to a special purpose to stay ahead competitivelysimon erickson the thing that im trying to answer the fundamental question i have is it seems like all of the cloud companies are now using or starting to use fpgas right machine learning inference as a service why are they using fpgasjohn cohn for flexibility you can customize the logic to a workload i personally believe as a hardware guy that that will change were just at a new cusp where you need that flexibility the workloads that are happening for inferencing things like inferencing are kind of nuanced when you actually end up in a world where youre doing something like a gan generalized adversarial network what we would call inferencing actually has a fair bit of forward calculation computation in it you need acceleration on the way out youre not just doing a simple pass forwardthose kind of things are new we dont know what that hardware should look like i personally believe that itll eventually get to a point where well be able to choose a couple of classes itll eventually be sort of a combination of bigger components and eventually customized silicon but im a silicon guyi am a believer in the power of disruptive innovation and that individual investors can significantly outperform the market over long periods of time i am the lead advisor of our motley

caseymrossapril 2 2019the food and drug administration announced tuesday that it is developing a framework for regulating artificial intelligence products used in medicine that continually adapt based on new datathe agency’s outgoing commissioner scott gottlieb released a white paper that sets forth the broad outlines of the fda’s proposed approach to establishing greater oversight over this rapidly evolving segment of ai productsit is the most forceful step the fda has taken to assert the need to regulate a category of artificial intelligence systems whose performance constantly changes based on exposure to new patients and data in clinical settings these machinelearning systems present a particularly thorny problem for the fda because the agency is essentially trying to hit a moving target in regulating themadvertisementthe white paper describes criteria the agency proposes to use to determine when medical products that rely on artificial intelligence will require fda review before being commercializedthe review may examine the underlying performance of a product’s algorithms a manufacturer’s plan to make modifications and the manufacturer’s ability to manage the risks associated with any modifications“a new approach to these technologies would address the need for the algorithms to learn and adapt when used in the real world” gottlieb wrote in a statement accompanying the white paper “it would be a more tailored fit than our existing regulatory paradigm for software as a medical device”the paper is the first step in a monthslong process in which the fda will collect input from the public and a variety of stakeholders in medicine before finalizing a policy on regulating adaptive ai systemseric topol an expert in artificial intelligence at the scripps research institute said the white paper “demonstrates careful forethought about the field” of artificial intelligence in medicine he noted that the “document calls for proof in a clinical real world environment” which ideally should be prospective with “no ai algorithm approved only on the basis of retrospective computerized dataset analysis”he added that the eventual regulatory framework should support the ability of adaptive ai systems to learn and improve over time “it is important to come up with a means of not shortchanging the autodidactic power of deep learning nets that will continue to improve not ‘freeze’ at the time of approval” topol wrote in an email to statthe fda has already approved medical devices that rely on socalled “locked algorithms” or those that do not change each time an algorithm is used but instead are changed by a manufacturer at intervals using specific training data and a validation process to ensure proper functioning of the system among the devices approved last year were a device used to detect diabetic retinopathy a degenerative eye disease and another designed to alert providers of a potential stroke in patientsthe proper performance of those locked algorithms and others like them is crucial to ensuring that doctors base lifeanddeath treatment decisions on accurate information that task is harder for products that learn and evolve on their own in ways that are difficult even for the manufacturers of such systems to understand an example of such a system cited by gottlieb is one that uses algorithms to identify breast cancer lesions on mammograms and learns to improve its confidence or identify subgroups of cancer based on its exposure to additional real world data such systems are already in development in oncology and other areas of caregottlieb noted that this type of technology also offers huge potential for improving medical care and he said the agency is seeking to strike a regulatory balance that will allow promising products to get onto the market as soon as possible“artificial intelligence has helped transform industries like finance and manufacturing and i’m confident that these technologies will have a profound and positive impact on health care” he wrote in his statement “i can envision a world where one day artificial intelligence can help detect and treat challenging health problems for example by recognizing the signs of disease well in advance of what we can do today”national technology correspondentcasey covers the companies disrupting biopharma and health careartificial

stated simply ai is trying to make computers think and act like humansachieving this end requires three key componentsthe more humanlike the desired outcome the more data and processing power requiredat least since the first century bce humans have been intrigued by the possibility of creating machines that mimic the human brain in modern times the term artificial intelligence was coined in 1955 by john mccarthy in 1956 mccarthy and others organized a conference titled the “dartmouth summer research project on artificial intelligence” this beginning led to the creation of machine learning deep learning predictive analytics and now to prescriptive analytics it also gave rise to a whole new field of study data sciencetoday the amount of data that is generated by both humans and machines far outpaces humans’ ability to absorb interpret and make complex decisions based on that data artificial intelligence forms the basis for all computer learning and is the future of all complex decision making as an example most humans can figure out how to not lose at tictactoe noughts and crosses even though there are 255168 unique moves of which 46080 end in a draw far fewer folks would be considered grand champions of checkers with more than 500 x 1018 or 500 quintillion different potential moves computers are extremely efficient at calculating these combinations and permutations to arrive at the best decision ai and its logical evolution of machine learning and deep learning are the foundational future of business decision makingapplications of ai can be seen in everyday scenarios such as financial services fraud detection retail purchase predictions and online customer support interactions here are just a few examplesas the data authority for hybrid cloud

conducting research providing translations intelligent machine systems are transforming our lives for the better as these systems become more capable our world becomes more efficient and consequently richertech giants such as alphabet amazon facebook ibm and microsoft – as well as individuals like stephen hawking and elon musk – believe that now is the right time to talk about the nearly boundless landscape of artificial intelligence in many ways this is just as much a new frontier for ethics and risk assessment as it is for emerging technology so which issues and conversations keep ai experts up at night1 unemployment what happens after the end of jobsthe hierarchy of labour is concerned primarily with automation as we’ve invented ways to automate jobs we could create room for people to assume more complex roles moving from the physical work that dominated the preindustrial globe to the cognitive labour that characterizes strategic and administrative work in our globalized societylook at trucking it currently employs millions of individuals in the united states alone what will happen to them if the selfdriving trucks promised by tesla’s elon musk become widely available in the next decade but on the other hand if we consider the lower risk of accidents selfdriving trucks seem like an ethical choice the same scenario could happen to office workers as well as to the majority of the workforce in developed countriesthis is where we come to the question of how we are going to spend our time most people still rely on selling their time to have enough income to sustain themselves and their families we can only hope that this opportunity will enable people to find meaning in nonlabour activities such as caring for their families engaging with their communities and learning new ways to contribute to human societyif we succeed with the transition one day we might look back and think that it was barbaric that human beings were required to sell the majority of their waking time just to be able to live2 inequality how do we distribute the wealth created by machinesour economic system is based on compensation for contribution to the economy often assessed using an hourly wage the majority of companies are still dependent on hourly work when it comes to products and services but by using artificial intelligence a company can drastically cut down on relying on the human workforce and this means that revenues will go to fewer people consequently individuals who have ownership in aidriven companies will make all the moneywe are already seeing a widening wealth gap where startup founders take home a large portion of the economic surplus they create in 2014 roughly the same revenues were generated by the three biggest companies in detroit and the three biggest companies in silicon valley only in silicon valley there were 10 times fewer employeesif we’re truly imagining a postwork society how do we structure a fair postlabour economy3 humanity how do machines affect our behaviour and interactionartificially intelligent bots are becoming better and better at modelling human conversation and relationships in 2015 a bot named eugene goostman won the turing challenge for the first time in this challenge human raters used text input to chat with an unknown entity then guessed whether they had been chatting with a human or a machine eugene goostman fooled more than half of the human raters into thinking they had been talking to a human beingthis milestone is only the start of an age where we will frequently interact with machines as if they are humans whether in customer service or sales while humans are limited in the attention and kindness that they can expend on another person artificial bots can channel virtually unlimited resources into building relationshipseven though not many of us are aware of this we are already witnesses to how machines can trigger the reward centres in the human brain just look at clickbait headlines and video games these headlines are often optimized with ab testing a rudimentary form of algorithmic optimization for content to capture our attention this and other methods are used to make numerous video and mobile games become addictive tech addiction is the new frontier of human dependencyon the other hand maybe we can think of a different use for software which has already become effective at directing human attention and triggering certain actions when used right this could evolve into an opportunity to nudge society towards more beneficial behavior however in the wrong hands it could prove detrimental4 artificial stupidity how can we guard against mistakesintelligence comes from learning whether you’re human or machine systems usually have a training phase in which they learn to detect the right patterns and act according to their input once a system is fully trained it can then go into test phase where it is hit with more examples and we see how it performsobviously the training phase cannot cover all possible examples that a system may deal with in the real world these systems can be fooled in ways that humans wouldnt be for example random dot patterns can lead a machine to “see” things that aren’t there if we rely on ai to bring us into a new world of labour security and efficiency we need to ensure that the machine performs as planned and that people can’t overpower it to use it for their own ends5 racist robots how do we eliminate ai biasthough artificial intelligence is capable of a speed and capacity of processing that’s far beyond that of humans it cannot always be trusted to be fair and neutral google and its parent company alphabet are one of the leaders when it comes to artificial intelligence as seen in google’s photos service where ai is used to identify people objects and scenes but it can go wrong such as when a camera missed the mark on racial sensitivity or when a software used to predict future criminals showed bias against black peoplewe shouldn’t forget that ai systems are created by humans who can be biased and judgemental once again if used right or if used by those who strive for social progress artificial intelligence can become a catalyst for positive change6 security how do we keep ai safe from adversariesthe more powerful a technology becomes the more can it be used for nefarious reasons as well as good this applies not only to robots produced to replace human soldiers or autonomous weapons but to ai systems that can cause damage if used maliciously because these fights wont be fought on the battleground only cybersecurity will become even more important after all we’re dealing with a system that is faster and more capable than us by orders of magnitude7 evil genies how do we protect against unintended consequencesit’s not just adversaries we have to worry about what if artificial intelligence itself turned against us this doesnt mean by turning evil in the way a human might or the way ai disasters are depicted in hollywood movies rather we can imagine an advanced ai system as a genie in a bottle that can fulfill wishes but with terrible unforeseen consequencesin the case of a machine there is unlikely to be malice at play only a lack of understanding of the full context in which the wish was made imagine an ai system that is asked to eradicate cancer in the world after a lot of computing it spits out a formula that does in fact bring about the end of cancer – by killing everyone on the planet the computer would have achieved its goal of no more cancer very efficiently but not in the way humans intended it8 singularity how do we stay in control of a complex intelligent systemthe reason humans are on top of the food chain is not down to sharp teeth or strong muscles human dominance is almost entirely due to our ingenuity and intelligence we can get the better of bigger faster stronger animals because we can create and use tools to control them both physical tools such as cages and weapons and cognitive tools like training and conditioningthis poses a serious question about artificial intelligence will it one day have the same advantage over us we cant rely on just pulling the plug either because a sufficiently advanced machine may anticipate this move and defend itself this is what some call the “singularity” the point in time when human beings are no longer the most intelligent beings on earth9 robot rights how do we define the humane treatment of aiwhile neuroscientists are still working on unlocking the secrets of conscious experience we understand more about the basic mechanisms of reward and aversion we share these mechanisms with even simple animals in a way we are building similar mechanisms of reward and aversion in systems of artificial intelligence for example reinforcement learning is similar to training a dog improved performance is reinforced with a virtual rewardright now these systems are fairly superficial but they are becoming more complex and lifelike could we consider a system to be suffering when its reward functions give it negative input whats more socalled genetic algorithms work by creating many instances of a system at once of which only the most successful survive and combine to form the next generation of instances this happens over many generations and is a way of improving a system the unsuccessful instances are deleted at what point might we consider genetic algorithms a form of mass murderonce we consider machines as entities that can perceive feel and act its not a huge leap to ponder their legal status should they be treated like animals of comparable intelligence will we consider the suffering of feeling machinessome ethical questions are about mitigating suffering some about risking negative outcomes while we consider these risks we should also keep in mind that on the whole this technological progress means better lives for everyone artificial

also offers opportunities for student engagement that cannot be found in often outdated documents or in the fixed environment in a synergistic fashion ai has the potential to propel and accelerate the discovery of new learning frontiers and the creation of innovative technologiesthough yet to become a standard cult in organizations and schools artificial intelligence in learning or training has been a big thing since ai’s uptick in the 1940s when the first seeds of ai were sown with programmable computers in many ways the 2 seem made for each other ai’s digital dynamic nature also offers opportunities for learner engagement that cannot be found in often outdated documents or in the fixed environmenta recent study from eschool news discovered that the use of ai in the education industry will grow by 475 through 2021 the technology’s impact will exist anywhere from kindergarten through higher education to corporate training offering the opportunity to create adaptive learning features with personalized tools to improve learners experiencehere are 4 ways ai is changing the learning industrythe concept of smart content is a trendy theme now as ai can create digital content with the same degree of grammatical prowess as their human doppelganger smart learning content creation from digitized guides of textbooks to customizable learning digital interfaces are being introduced at all levels from elementary to postsecondary to corporate environmentsone of the ways to use this in an organization is when ai can condense the content in burdening troubleshooting guides into more digestible study guides with troubleshooting steps summary flashcards and intelligent simulationssmart learning content can also be used to design a digital curriculum and content across a variety of devices including video audio and an online assistantai can do more than condense a lecture into flashcards and smart study guides as it can also tutor a learner based on the difficulties they’re having this involves something known as mastery learning mastery learning is a set of principles largely tied to the work of educational psychologist benjamin bloom in the 1970s this supports the effectiveness of individualized tutoring and instruction in the classroomthere are now smart tutoring systems that use data from specific learners to give them the feedback and work with them directly for instance an intelligent tutoring system called sherlock is being used to teach airforce technicians to diagnose electrical system problems in aircraft another advanced version of intelligent tutoring systems is avatarbased training modules which were developed by the university of southern california to train military personnel being sent on international postswhile this ai application is still in its early stages it will soon be able to work as a fullfledged digital platform that helps learners with their educational needs in just about any area of need also these platforms will soon be able to adapt to a wide variety of learning styles to help every educator and learnerwith ai an actual lecturer may soon be replaced by a robot well not entirely but there are already virtual human mentors and facilitators that can think and act like humans but how does a virtual facilitator think or act like a humana new trending technology is known as the touchless technology or gesture recognition technology gives virtual facilitators the ability to respond or act like humans in a natural way responding both verbal and nonverbal cuessmart learning environments and platforms use ai 3d gaming and computer animation to create realistic virtual characters and social interactions this initiative includes more than virtual facilitators as augmented reality may soon be a part of the trainingcontent analytics refers to ai specifically machine learning platforms that optimize learning modules through ai content taught to learners can be analyzed for maximum effect and optimized to take care of learners needs content analytics enables educators and content providers to not just create and manage their elearning content but also gain important insights into learner progress and understanding through a powerful set of analyticslearning is a domain largely ruled by humantohuman interaction the assimilation of ai has been slower to develop the necessary humanlike attributes of receptivity versatility and understanding yet there are plenty of areas where ai’s inherent strengths help fill highneed gaps in learning and teachingai’s ability to analyze large amounts of data in realtime and automatically provide new content or specified learning parameters helps meet learners’ need for continual targeted practice and feedback this allows teachers or trainers to better understand the learner’s performance and orchestrate more effective personalized learning plansto conclude it is the apparent fear that human educators can or will be replaced by ai technologies in the coming decade as ai advances in education and training it seems there is more evidence to support the idea that both intelligent systems and humans are needed to manage different aspects of learners’ academic and social competencies i feel ai will likely not replace but will serve as a support system to the human expertloved this article please share your

with control of complex systemsyears ago i had coffee with a friend who ran a startup he had just turned 40 his father was ill his back was sore and he found himself overwhelmed by life “don’t laugh at me” he said “but i was counting on the singularity”my friend worked in technology he’d seen the changes that faster microprocessors and networks had wrought it wasn’t that much of a step for him to believe that before he was beset by middle age the intelligence of machines would exceed that of humans—a moment that futurists call the singularity a benevolent superintelligence might analyze the human genetic code at great speed and unlock the secret to eternal youth at the very least it might know how to fix your backbut what if it wasn’t so benevolent nick bostrom a philosopher who directs the future of humanity institute at the university of oxford describes the following scenario in his book superintelligence which has prompted a great deal of debate about the future of artificial intelligence imagine a machine that we might call a “paperclip maximizer”—that is a machine programmed to make as many paper clips as possible now imagine that this machine somehow became incredibly intelligent given its goals it might then decide to create new more efficient paperclipmanufacturing machines—until king midas style it had converted essentially everything to paper clipsno worries you might say you could just program it to make exactly a million paper clips and halt but what if it makes the paper clips and then decides to check its work has it counted correctly it needs to become smarter to be sure the superintelligent machine manufactures some asyetuninvented rawcomputing material call it “computronium” and uses that to check each doubt but each new doubt yields further digital doubts and so on until the entire earth is converted to computronium except for the million paper clipsbostrom does not believe that the paperclip maximizer will come to be exactly it’s a thought experiment one designed to show how even careful system design can fail to restrain extreme machine intelligence but he does believe that superintelligence could emerge and while it could be great he thinks it could also decide it doesn’t need humans around or do any number of other things that destroy the world the title of chapter 8 is “is the default outcome doom”if this sounds absurd to you you’re not alone critics such as the robotics pioneer rodney brooks say that people who fear a runaway ai misunderstand what computers are doing when we say they’re thinking or getting smart from this perspective the putative superintelligence bostrom describes is far in the future and perhaps impossibleyet a lot of smart thoughtful people agree with bostrom and are worried now whyvolitionthe question “can a machine think” has shadowed computer science from its beginnings alan turing proposed in 1950 that a machine could be taught like a child john mccarthy inventor of the programming language lisp coined the term “artificial intelligence” in 1955 as ai researchers in the 1960s and 1970s began to use computers to recognize images translate between languages and understand instructions in normal language and not just code the idea that computers would eventually develop the ability to speak and think—and thus to do evil—bubbled into mainstream culture even beyond the oftreferenced hal from 2001 a space odyssey the 1970 movie colossus the forbin project featured a large blinking mainframe computer that brings the world to the brink of nuclear destruction a similar theme was explored 13 years later in wargames the androids of 1973’s westworld went crazy and started killingextreme ai predictions are “comparable to seeing more efficient internal combustion engines… and jumping to the conclusion that the warp drives are just around the corner” rodney brooks writeswhen ai research fell far short of its lofty goals funding dried up to a trickle beginning long “ai winters” even so the torch of the intelligent machine was carried forth in the 1980s and ’90s by scifi authors like vernor vinge who popularized the concept of the singularity researchers like the roboticist hans moravec an expert in computer vision and the engineerentrepreneur ray kurzweil author of the 1999 book the age of spiritual machines whereas turing had posited a humanlike intelligence vinge moravec and kurzweil were thinking bigger when a computer became capable of independently devising ways to achieve goals it would very likely be capable of introspection—and thus able to modify its software and make itself more intelligent in short order such a computer would be able to design its own hardwareas kurzweil described it this would begin a beautiful new era such machines would have the insight and patience measured in picoseconds to solve the outstanding problems of nanotechnology and spaceflight they would improve the human condition and let us upload our consciousness into an immortal digital form intelligence would spread throughout the cosmosyou can also find the exact opposite of such sunny optimism stephen hawking has warned that because people would be unable to compete with an advanced ai it “could spell the end of the human race” upon reading superintelligence the entrepreneur elon musk tweeted “hope we’re not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence unfortunately that is increasingly probable” musk then followed with a 10 million grant to the future of life institute not to be confused with bostrom’s center this is an organization that says it is “working to mitigate existential risks facing humanity” the ones that could arise “from the development of humanlevel artificial intelligence”no one is suggesting that anything like superintelligence exists now in fact we still have nothing approaching a generalpurpose artificial intelligence or even a clear path to how it could be achieved recent advances in ai from automated assistants such as apple’s siri to google’s driverless cars also reveal the technology’s severe limitations both can be thrown off by situations that they haven’t encountered before artificial neural networks can learn for themselves to recognize cats in photos but they must be shown hundreds of thousands of examples and still end up much less accurate at spotting cats than a childthis is where skeptics such as brooks a founder of irobot and rethink robotics come in even if it’s impressive—relative to what earlier computers could manage—for a computer to recognize a picture of a cat the machine has no volition no sense of what catness is or what else is happening in the picture and none of the countless other insights that humans have in this view ai could possibly lead to intelligent machines but it would take much more work than people like bostrom imagine and even if it could happen intelligence will not necessarily lead to sentience extrapolating from the state of ai today to suggest that superintelligence is looming is “comparable to seeing more efficient internal combustion engines appearing and jumping to the conclusion that warp drives are just around the corner” brooks wrote recently on edgeorg “malevolent ai” is nothing to worry about he says for a few hundred years at leastinsurance policyeven if the odds of a superintelligence arising are very long perhaps it’s irresponsible to take the chance one person who shares bostrom’s concerns is stuart j russell a professor of computer science at the university of california berkeley russell is the author with peter norvig a peer of kurzweil’s at google of artificial intelligence a modern approach which has been the standard ai textbook for two decades“there are a lot of supposedly smart public intellectuals who just haven’t a clue” russell told me he pointed out that ai has advanced tremendously in the last decade and that while the public might understand progress in terms of moore’s law faster computers are doing more in fact recent ai work has been fundamental with techniques like deep learning laying the groundwork for computers that can automatically increase their understanding of the world around thembostrom’s book proposes ways to align computers with human needs we’re basically telling a god how we’d like to be treatedbecause google facebook and other companies are actively looking to create an intelligent “learning” machine he reasons “i would say that one of the things we ought not to do is to press full steam ahead on building superintelligence without giving thought to the potential risks it just seems a bit daft” russell made an analogy “it’s like fusion research if you ask a fusion researcher what they do they say they work on containment if you want unlimited energy you’d better contain the fusion reaction” similarly he says if you want unlimited intelligence you’d better figure out how to align computers with human needsbostrom’s book is a research proposal for doing so a superintelligence would be godlike but would it be animated by wrath or by love it’s up to us that is the engineers like any parent we must give our child a set of values and not just any values but those that are in the best interest of humanity we’re basically telling a god how we’d like to be treated how to proceedbostrom draws heavily on an idea from a thinker named eliezer yudkowsky who talks about “coherent extrapolated volition”—the consensusderived “best self” of all people ai would we hope wish to give us rich happy fulfilling lives fix our sore backs and show us how to get to mars and since humans will never fully agree on anything we’ll sometimes need it to decide for us—to make the best decisions for humanity as a whole how then do we program those values into our potential superintelligences what sort of mathematics can define them these are the problems bostrom believes that researchers should be solving now bostrom says it is “the essential task of our age”for the civilian there’s no reason to lose sleep over scary robots we have no technology that is remotely close to superintelligence then again many of the largest corporations in the world are deeply invested in making their computers more intelligent a true ai would give any one of these companies an unbelievable advantage they also should be attuned to its potential downsides and figuring out how to avoid themthis somewhat more nuanced suggestion—without any claims of a looming aimageddon—is the basis of an open letter on the website of the future of life institute the group that got musk’s donation rather than warning of existential disaster the letter calls for more research into reaping the benefits of ai “while avoiding potential pitfalls” this letter is signed not just by ai outsiders such as hawking musk and bostrom but also by prominent computer scientists including demis hassabis a top ai researcher you can see where they’re coming from after all if they develop an artificial intelligence that doesn’t share the best human values it will mean they weren’t smart enough

look at four artificial intelligence etfs for investors to considerit might be surprising but the phrase “artificial intelligence” has been around for over half a century — since 1955 in fact it was intended to describe a new computer science subdisciplinebut what exactly is artificial intelligence in simple terms artificial intelligence or ai means “simulated intelligence in machines” in other words machines with ai are capable of thinking like people and mimicking their actions sort of like a robot the ideal characteristic of ai is the ability to rationalizeof course that is a very broad definition of the capabilities ai encompasses there are actually at least 10 different types of ai which seems to prove that this market isn’t going anywhere anytime sooncase in point research conducted by markets and markets suggests the ai industry will be worth over 16 billion by 2022 increasing at a compound annual growth rate of 629 percent between 2016 and 2022 with that much money going into the sector there is certainly no shortage of ways for investors to get their feet wet and add ai investments to their portfoliosfor those who are new to investing and would rather invest in a market rather than a specific company etfs are a popular way to do so here the investing news network looks at the four solely aifocused etfs listed on etfdbcom the list was current as of september 6 2018according to etfdbcom these artificial intelligence etfs are required to meet one of three criteriafirst on our artificial intelligence etfs list is the buzz us sentiment leaders etf which is relatively new — the fund came into being in april 2016 it tracks the buzz nextgen ai us sentiment leaders index which follows the 75 uslisted stocks that are the most discussed in news articles blogs

etf which launched in september 2016 it offers exposure to firms involved in the global automation and robotics industriesaccording to etfcom the global x robotics etf has net assets of 22 billion with holdings in markets such as industrials technology healthcare and energy eligible companies are listed in developed countries and must earn a significant portion of their revenue from or have a stated business purpose in the field of robotics or artificial intelligencethe etf currently tracks 37 holdings with its biggest one being intuitive surgical nasdaqisrg and its secondlargest one being

productivity and reduces coststhe fund describes itself as including companies that may “benefit from the development of new products or services technological improvements and advancements in scientific research related to among other things energy automation and manufacturing materials and transportation”ark tracks between 30 and 50 holdings with its two biggest holdings being stratasys nasdaqssys and tesla nasdaqtsla according to its website it currently has 147 million in assets and by 2035 it plans to have over 12 trillion invested in automation and roboticslast but not least on our artificial intelligence etfs list is the robo global robotics and automation index whose inception date is october 2013it was the first robotics and automation etf to market and as its name

just a friendly little argument about the fate of humanity demis hassabis a leading creator of advanced artificial intelligence was chatting with elon musk a leading doomsayer about the perils of artificial intelligencethey are two of the most consequential and intriguing men in silicon valley who don’t live there hassabis a cofounder of the mysterious london laboratory deepmind had come to musk’s spacex rocket factory outside los angeles a few years ago they were in the canteen talking as a massive rocket part traversed overhead musk explained that his ultimate goal at spacex was the most important project in the world interplanetary colonizationhassabis replied that in fact he was working on the most important project in the world developing artificial superintelligence musk countered that this was one reason we needed to colonize mars—so that we’ll have a bolthole if ai goes rogue and turns on humanity amused hassabis said that ai would simply follow humans to marsthis did nothing to soothe musk’s anxieties even though he says there are scenarios where ai wouldn’t followan unassuming but competitive 40yearold hassabis is regarded as the merlin who will likely help conjure our ai children the field of ai is rapidly developing but still far from the powerful selfevolving software that haunts musk facebook uses ai for targeted advertising photo tagging and curated news feeds microsoft and apple use ai to power their digital assistants cortana and siri google’s search engine from the beginning has been dependent on ai all of these small advances are part of the chase to eventually create flexible selfteaching ai that will mirror human learningwithout oversight musk believes ai could be an existential threat “we are summoning the demon”some in silicon valley were intrigued to learn that hassabis a skilled chess player and former videogame designer once came up with a game called evil genius featuring a malevolent scientist who creates a doomsday device to achieve world domination peter thiel the billionaire venture capitalist and donald trump adviser who cofounded paypal with musk and others—and who in december helped gather skeptical silicon valley titans including musk for a meeting with the presidentelect—told me a story about an investor in deepmind who joked as he left a meeting that he ought to shoot hassabis on the spot because it was the last chance to save the human raceelon musk began warning about the possibility of ai running amok three years ago it probably hadn’t eased his mind when one of hassabis’s partners in deepmind shane legg stated flatly “i think human extinction will probably occur and technology will likely play a part in this”before deepmind was gobbled up by google in 2014 as part of its ai shopping spree musk had been an investor in the company he told me that his involvement was not about a return on his money but rather to keep a wary eye on the arc of ai “it gave me more visibility into the rate at which things were improving and i think they’re really improving at an accelerating rate far faster than people realize mostly because in everyday life you don’t see robots walking around maybe your roomba or something but roombas aren’t going to take over the world”in a startling public reproach to his friends and fellow techies musk warned that they could be creating the means of their own destruction he told bloomberg’s ashlee vance the author of the biography elon musk that he was afraid that his friend larry page a cofounder of google and now the ceo of its parent company alphabet could have perfectly good intentions but still “produce something evil by accident”—including possibly “a fleet of artificial intelligenceenhanced robots capable of destroying mankind”at the world government summit in dubai in february musk again cued the scary organ music evoking the plots of classic horror stories when he noted that “sometimes what will happen is a scientist will get so engrossed in their work that they don’t really realize the ramifications of what they’re doing” he said that the way to escape human obsolescence in the end may be by “having some sort of merger of biological intelligence and machine intelligence” this vulcan mindmeld could involve something called a neural lace—an injectable mesh that would literally hardwire your brain to communicate directly with computers “we’re already cyborgs” musk told me in february “your phone and your computer are extensions of you but the interface is through finger movements or speech which are very slow” with a neural lace inside your skull you would flash data from your brain wirelessly to your digital devices or to virtually unlimited computing power in the cloud “for a meaningful partialbrain interface i think we’re roughly four or five years away”musk’s alarming views on the dangers of ai first went viral after he spoke at mit in 2014—speculating pretrump that ai was probably humanity’s “biggest existential threat” he added that he was increasingly inclined to think there should be some national or international regulatory oversight—anathema to silicon valley—“to make sure that we don’t do something very foolish” he went on “with artificial intelligence we are summoning the demon you know all those stories where there’s the guy with the pentagram and the holy water and he’s like yeah he’s sure he can control the demon doesn’t work out” some ai engineers found musk’s theatricality so absurdly amusing that they began echoing it when they would return to the lab after a break they’d say “ok let’s get back to work summoning”musk wasn’t laughing “elon’s crusade” as one of his friends and fellow tech big shots calls it against unfettered ai had begunelon musk smiled when i mentioned to him that he comes across as something of an ayn randian hero “i have heard that before” he said in his slight south african accent “she obviously has a fairly extreme set of views but she has some good points in there”but ayn rand would do some rewrites on elon musk she would make his eyes gray and his face more gaunt she would refashion his public demeanor to be less droll and she would not countenance his goofy giggle she would certainly get rid of all his nonsense about the “collective” good she would find great material in the 45yearold’s complicated personal life his first wife the fantasy writer justine musk and their five sons one set of twins one of triplets and his much younger second wife the british actress talulah riley who played the boring bennet sister in the keira knightley version of pride prejudice riley and musk were married divorced and then remarried they are now divorced again last fall musk tweeted that talulah “does a great job playing a deadly sexbot” on hbo’s westworld adding a smileyface emoticon it’s hard for mere mortal women to maintain a relationship with someone as insanely obsessed with work as musk“how much time does a woman want a week” he asked ashlee vance “maybe ten hours that’s kind of the minimum”mostly rand would savor musk a hyperlogical riskloving industrialist he enjoys costume parties wingwalking and japanese steampunk extravaganzas robert downey jr used musk as a model for iron man marc mathieu the chief marketing officer of samsung usa who has gone flyfishing in iceland with musk calls him “a cross between steve jobs and jules verne”as they danced at their wedding reception justine later recalled musk informed her “i am the alpha in this relationship”in a tech universe full of skinny guys in hoodies—whipping up bots that will chat with you and apps that can study a photo of a dog and tell you what breed it is—musk is a throwback to henry ford and hank rearden in atlas shrugged rearden gives his wife a bracelet made from the first batch of his revolutionary metal as though it were made of diamonds musk has a chunk of one of his rockets mounted on the wall of his bel air house like a work of artmusk shoots for the moon—literally he launches costefficient rockets into space and hopes to eventually inhabit the red planet in february he announced plans to send two space tourists on a flight around the moon as early as next year he creates sleek batteries that could lead to a world powered by cheap solar energy he forges gleaming steel into sensuous tesla electric cars with such elegant lines that even the nitpicking steve jobs would have been hardpressed to find fault he wants to save time as well as humanity he dreamed up the hyperloop an electromagnetic bullet train in a tube which may one day whoosh travelers between la and san francisco at 700 miles per hour when musk visited secretary of defense ashton carter last summer he mischievously tweeted that he was at the pentagon to talk about designing a tony starkstyle “flying metal suit” sitting in traffic in la in december getting bored and frustrated he tweeted about creating the boring company to dig tunnels under the city to rescue the populace from “souldestroying traffic” by january according to bloomberg businessweek musk had assigned a senior spacex engineer to oversee the plan and had started digging his first test hole his sometimes quixotic efforts to save the world have inspired a parody twitter account “bored elon musk” where a faux musk spouts off wacky ideas such as “oxford commas as a service” and “bunches of bananas genetically engineered” so that the bananas ripen one at a timeof course big dreamers have big stumbles some spacex rockets have blown up and last may a driver was killed in a selfdriving tesla whose sensors failed to notice the tractortrailer crossing its path an investigation by the national highway traffic safety administration found that tesla’s autopilot system was not to blamemusk is stoic about setbacks but all too conscious of nightmare scenarios his views reflect a dictum from atlas shrugged “man has the power to act as his own destroyer—and that is the way he has acted through most of his history” as he told me “we are the first species capable of selfannihilation”here’s the nagging thought you can’t escape as you drive around from glass box to glass box in silicon valley the lords of the cloud love to yammer about turning the world into a better place as they churn out new algorithms apps and inventions that it is claimed will make our lives easier healthier funnier closer cooler longer and kinder to the planet and yet there’s a creepy feeling underneath it all a sense that we’re the mice in their experiments that they regard us humans as betamaxes or eighttracks old technology that will soon be discarded so that they can get on to enjoying their sleek new world many people there have accepted this future we’ll live to be 150 years old but we’ll have machine overlordsmaybe we already have overlords as musk slyly told recode’s annual code conference last year in rancho palos verdes california we could already be playthings in a simulatedreality world run by an advanced civilization reportedly two silicon valley billionaires are working on an algorithm to break us out of the matrixamong the engineers lured by the sweetness of solving the next problem the prevailing attitude is that empires fall societies change and we are marching toward the inevitable phase ahead they argue not about “whether” but rather about “how close” we are to replicating and improving on ourselves sam altman the 31yearold president of y combinator the valley’s top startup accelerator believes humanity is on the brink of such invention“the hard part of standing on an exponential curve is when you look backwards it looks flat and when you look forward it looks vertical” he told me “and it’s very hard to calibrate how much you are moving because it always looks the same”you’d think that anytime musk stephen hawking and bill gates are all raising the same warning about ai—as all of them are—it would be a 10alarm fire but for a long time the fog of fatalism over the bay area was thick musk’s crusade was viewed as sisyphean at best and luddite at worst the paradox is this many tech oligarchs see everything they are doing to help us and all their benevolent manifestos as streetlamps on the road to a future where as steve wozniak says humans are the family petsbut musk is not going gently he plans on fighting this with every fiber of his carbonbased being musk and altman have founded openai a billiondollar nonprofit company to work for safer artificial intelligence i sat down with the two men when their new venture had only a handful of young engineers and a makeshift office an apartment in san francisco’s mission district that belongs to greg brockman openai’s 28yearold cofounder and chief technology officer when i went back recently to talk with brockman and ilya sutskever the company’s 30yearold research director and also a cofounder openai had moved into an airy office nearby with a robot the usual complement of snacks and 50 fulltime employees another 10 to 30 are on the wayaltman in gray tshirt and jeans is all wiry pale intensity musk’s fervor is masked by his diffident manner and rosy countenance his eyes are green or blue depending on the light and his lips are plum red he has an aura of command while retaining a trace of the gawky lonely south african teenager who immigrated to canada by himself at the age of 17in silicon valley a lunchtime meeting does not necessarily involve that mundane fuel known as food younger coders are too absorbed in algorithms to linger over meals some just chug soylent older ones are so obsessed with immortality that sometimes they’re just washing down health pills with almond milkat first blush openai seemed like a bantamweight vanity project a bunch of brainy kids in a walkup apartment taking on the multibilliondollar efforts at google facebook and other companies which employ the world’s leading ai experts but then playing a wellheeled david to goliath is musk’s specialty and he always does it with style—and some useful sensationalismlet others in silicon valley focus on their ipo price and ridding san francisco of what they regard as its unsightly homeless population musk has larger aims like ending global warming and dying on mars just not he says on impactmusk began to see man’s fate in the galaxy as his personal obligation three decades ago when as a teenager he had a fullblown existential crisis musk told me that the hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy by douglas adams was a turning point for him the book is about aliens destroying the earth to make way for a hyperspace highway and features marvin the paranoid android and a supercomputer designed to answer all the mysteries of the universe musk slipped at least one reference to the book into the software of the tesla model s as a teenager vance writes in his biography musk formulated a mission statement for himself “the only thing that makes sense to do is strive for greater collective enlightenment”openai got under way with a vague mandate—which isn’t surprising given that people in the field are still arguing over what form ai will take what it will be able to do and what can be done about it so far public policy on ai is strangely undetermined and software is largely unregulated the federal aviation administration oversees drones the securities and exchange commission oversees automated financial trading and the department of transportation has begun to oversee selfdriving carsmusk believes that it is better to try to get superai first and distribute the technology to the world than to allow the algorithms to be concealed and concentrated in the hands of tech or government elites—even when the tech elites happen to be his own friends people such as google founders larry page and sergey brin “i’ve had many conversations with larry about ai and robotics—many many” musk told me “and some of them have gotten quite heated you know i think it’s not just larry but there are many futurists who feel a certain inevitability or fatalism about robots where we’d have some sort of peripheral role the phrase used is ‘we are the biological bootloader for digital superintelligence’ ” a boot loader is the small program that launches the operating system when you first turn on your computer “matter can’t organize itself into a chip” musk explained “but it can organize itself into a biological entity that gets increasingly sophisticated and ultimately can create the chip”musk has no intention of being a boot loader page and brin see themselves as forces for good but musk says the issue goes far beyond the motivations of a handful of silicon valley executives“it’s great when the emperor is marcus aurelius” he says “it’s not so great when the emperor is caligula”after the socalled ai winter—the broad commercial failure in the late 80s of an early ai technology that wasn’t up to snuff—artificial intelligence got a reputation as snake oil now it’s the hot thing again in this gogo era in the valley greg brockman of openai believes the next decade will be all about ai with everyone throwing money at the small number of “wizards” who know the ai “incantations” guys who got rich writing code to solve banal problems like how to pay a stranger for stuff online now contemplate a vertiginous world where they are the creators of a new reality and perhaps a new speciesmicrosoft’s jaron lanier the dreadlocked computer scientist known as the father of virtual reality gave me his view as to why the digerati find the “sciencefiction fantasy” of ai so tantalizing “it’s saying ‘oh you digital techy people you’re like gods you’re creating life you’re transforming reality’ there’s a tremendous narcissism in it that we’re the people who can do it no one else the pope can’t do it the president can’t do it no one else can do it we are the masters of it the software we’re building is our immortality” this kind of godlike ambition isn’t new he adds “i read about it once in a story about a golden calf” he shook his head “don’t get high on your own supply you know”google has gobbled up almost every interesting robotics and machinelearning company over the last few years it bought deepmind for 650 million reportedly beating out facebook and built the google brain team to work on ai it hired geoffrey hinton a british pioneer in artificial neural networks and ray kurzweil the eccentric futurist who has predicted that we are only 28 years away from the rapturelike “singularity”—the moment when the spiraling capabilities of selfimproving artificial superintelligence will far exceed human intelligence and human beings will merge with ai to create the “godlike” hybrid beings of the futureit’s in larry page’s blood and google’s dna to believe that ai is the company’s inevitable destiny—think of that destiny as you will “if evil ai lights up” ashlee vance told me “it will light up first at google” if google could get computers to master search when search was the most important problem in the world then presumably it can get computers to do everything else in march of last year silicon valley gulped when a fabled south korean player of the world’s most complex board game go was beaten in seoul by deepmind’s alphago hassabis who has said he is running an apollo program for ai called it a “historic moment” and admitted that even he was surprised it happened so quickly “i’ve always hoped that ai could help us discover completely new ideas in complex scientific domains” hassabis told me in february “this might be one of the first glimpses of that kind of creativity” more recently alphago played 60 games online against top go players in china japan and korea—and emerged with a record of 600 in january in another shock to the system an ai program showed that it could bluff libratus built by two carnegie mellon researchers was able to crush top poker players at texas hold ‘empeter thiel told me about a friend of his who says that the only reason people tolerate silicon valley is that no one there seems to be having any sex or any fun but there are reports of sex robots on the way that come with apps that can control their moods and even have a pulse the valley is skittish when it comes to female sex robots—an obsession in japan—because of its notoriously maledominated culture and its muchpublicized issues with sexual harassment and discrimination but when i asked musk about this he replied matteroffactly “sex robots i think those are quite likely”whether sincere or a shrewd pr move hassabis made it a condition of the google acquisition that google and deepmind establish a joint ai ethics board at the time three years ago forming an ethics board was seen as a precocious move as if to imply that hassabis was on the verge of achieving true ai now not so much last june a researcher at deepmind coauthored a paper outlining a way to design a “big red button” that could be used as a kill switch to stop ai from inflicting harmgoogle executives say larry page’s view on ai is shaped by his frustration about how many systems are suboptimal—from systems that book trips to systems that price crops he believes that ai will improve people’s lives and has said that when human needs are more easily met people will “have more time with their family or to pursue their own interests” especially when a robot throws them out of workmusk is a friend of page’s he attended page’s wedding and sometimes stays at his house when he’s in the san francisco area “it’s not worth having a house for one or two nights a week” the 99thrichest man in the world explained to me at times musk has expressed concern that page may be naïve about how ai could play out if page is inclined toward the philosophy that machines are only as good or bad as the people creating them musk firmly disagrees some at google—perhaps annoyed that musk is in essence pointing a finger at them for rushing ahead willynilly—dismiss his dystopic take as a cinematic cliché eric schmidt the executive chairman of google’s parent company put it this way “robots are invented countries arm them an evil dictator turns the robots on humans and all humans will be killed sounds like a movie to me”some in silicon valley argue that musk is interested less in saving the world than in buffing his brand and that he is exploiting a deeply rooted conflict the one between man and machine and our fear that the creation will turn against us they gripe that his epic goodversusevil story line is about luring talent at discount rates and incubating his own ai software for cars and rockets it’s certainly true that the bay area has always had a healthy respect for making a buck as sam spade said in the maltese falcon “most things in san francisco can be bought or taken”musk is without doubt a dazzling salesman who better than a guardian of human welfare to sell you your new selfdriving tesla andrew ng—the chief scientist at baidu known as china’s google—based in sunnyvale california writes off musk’s manichaean throwdown as “marketing genius” “at the height of the recession he persuaded the us government to help him build an electric sports car” ng recalled incredulous the stanford professor is married to a robotics expert issued a robotthemed engagement announcement and keeps a “trust the robot” black jacket hanging on the back of his chair he thinks people who worry about ai going rogue are distracted by “phantoms” and regards getting alarmed now as akin to worrying about overpopulation on mars before we populate it “and i think it’s fascinating” he said about musk in particular “that in a rather short period of time he’s inserted himself into the conversation on ai i think he sees accurately that ai is going to create tremendous amounts of value”although he once called musk a “scifi version of p t barnum” ashlee vance thinks that musk’s concern about ai is genuine even if what he can actually do about it is unclear “his wife talulah told me they had latenight conversations about ai at home” vance noted “elon is brutally logical the way he tackles everything is like moving chess pieces around when he plays this scenario out in his head it doesn’t end well for people”eliezer yudkowsky a cofounder of the machine intelligence research institute in berkeley agrees “he’s elonfreakingmusk he doesn’t need to touch the third rail of the artificialintelligence controversy if he wants to be sexy he can just talk about mars colonization”some sniff that musk is not truly part of the whiteboard culture and that his scary scenarios miss the fact that we are living in a world where it’s hard to get your printer to work others chalk up openai in part to a case of fomo musk sees his friend page building newwave software in a hot field and craves a competing army of coders as vance sees it “elon wants all the toys that larry has they’re like these two superpowers they’re friends but there’s a lot of tension in their relationship” a rivalry of this kind might be best summed up by a line from the vainglorious head of the fictional tech behemoth hooli on hbo’s silicon valley “i don’t want to live in a world where someone else makes the world a better place better than we do”musk’s disagreement with page over the potential dangers of ai “did affect our friendship for a while” musk says “but that has since passed we are on good terms these days”musk never had as close a personal connection with 32yearold mark zuckerberg who has become an unlikely lifestyle guru setting a new challenge for himself every year these have included wearing a tie every day reading a book every two weeks learning mandarin and eating meat only from animals he killed with his own hands in 2016 it was ai’s turnzuckerberg has moved his ai experts to desks near his own three weeks after musk and altman announced their venture to make the world safe from malicious ai zuckerberg posted on facebook that his project for the year was building a helpful ai to assist him in managing his home—everything from recognizing his friends and letting them inside to keeping an eye on the nursery “you can think of it kind of like jarvis in iron man” he wroteone facebooker cautioned zuckerberg not to “accidentally create skynet” the military supercomputer that turns against human beings in the terminator movies “i think we can build ai so it works for us and helps us” zuckerberg replied and clearly throwing shade at musk he continued “some people fearmonger about how ai is a huge danger but that seems farfetched to me and much less likely than disasters due to widespread disease violence etc” or as he described his philosophy at a facebook developers’ conference last april in a clear rejection of warnings from musk and others he believes to be alarmists “choose hope over fear”in the november issue of wired guestedited by barack obama zuckerberg wrote that there is little basis beyond science fiction to worry about doomsday scenarios “if we slow down progress in deference to unfounded concerns we stand in the way of real gains” he compared ai jitters to early fears about airplanes noting “we didn’t rush to put rules in place about how airplanes should work before we figured out how they’d fly in the first place”zuckerberg introduced his ai butler jarvis right before christmas with the soothing voice of morgan freeman it was able to help with music lights and even making toast i asked the reallife iron man musk about zuckerberg’s jarvis when it was in its earliest stages “i wouldn’t call it ai to have your household functions automated” musk said “it’s really not ai to turn the lights on set the temperature”zuckerberg can be just as dismissive asked in germany whether musk’s apocalyptic forebodings were “hysterical” or “valid” zuckerberg replied “hysterical” and when musk’s spacex rocket blew up on the launch pad in september destroying a satellite facebook was leasing zuckerberg coldly posted that he was “deeply disappointed”musk and others who have raised a warning flag on ai have sometimes been treated like drama queens in january 2016 musk won the annual luddite award bestowed by a washington techpolicy think tank still he’s got some pretty good wingmen stephen hawking told the bbc “i think the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race” bill gates told charlie rose that ai was potentially more dangerous than a nuclear catastrophe nick bostrom a 43yearold oxford philosophy professor warned in his 2014 book superintelligence that “once unfriendly superintelligence exists it would prevent us from replacing it or changing its preferences our fate would be sealed” and last year henry kissinger jumped on the peril bandwagon holding a confidential meeting with top ai experts at the brook a private club in manhattan to discuss his concern over how smart robots could cause a rupture in history and unravel the way civilization worksin january 2015 musk bostrom and a who’s who of ai representing both sides of the split assembled in puerto rico for a conference hosted by max tegmark a 49yearold physics professor at mit who runs the future of life institute in boston“do you own a house” tegmark asked me “do you own fire insurance the consensus in puerto rico was that we needed fire insurance when we got fire and messed up with it we invented the fire extinguisher when we got cars and messed up we invented the seat belt air bag and traffic light but with nuclear weapons and ai we don’t want to learn from our mistakes we want to plan ahead” musk reminded tegmark that a precaution as sensible as seat belts had provoked fierce opposition from the automobile industrymusk who has kickstarted the funding of research into avoiding ai’s pitfalls said he would give the future of life institute “10 million reasons” to pursue the subject donating 10 million tegmark promptly gave 15 million to bostrom’s group in oxford the future of humanity institute explaining at the time why it was crucial to be “proactive and not reactive” musk said it was certainly possible to “construct scenarios where the recovery of human civilization does not occur”six months after the puerto rico conference musk hawking demis hassabis apple cofounder steve wozniak and stuart russell a computerscience professor at berkeley who coauthored the standard textbook on artificial intelligence along with 1000 other prominent figures signed a letter calling for a ban on offensive autonomous weapons “in 50 years this 18month period we’re in now will be seen as being crucial for the future of the ai community” russell told me “it’s when the ai community finally woke up and took itself seriously and thought about what to do to make the future better” last september the country’s biggest tech companies created the partnership on artificial intelligence to explore the full range of issues arising from ai including the ethical ones musk’s openai quickly joined this effort meanwhile the european union has been looking into legal issues arising from the advent of robots and ai—such as whether robots have “personhood” or as one financial times contributor wondered should be considered more like slaves in roman lawat tegmark’s second ai safety conference last january at the asilomar center in california—chosen because that’s where scientists gathered back in 1975 and agreed to limit genetic experimentation—the topic was not so contentious larry page who was not at the puerto rico conference was at asilomar and musk noted that their “conversation was no longer heated”but while it may have been “a comingout party for ai safety” as one attendee put it—part of “a sea change” in the last year or so as musk says—there’s still a long way to go “there’s no question that the top technologists in silicon valley now take ai far more seriously—that they do acknowledge it as a risk” he observes “i’m not sure that they yet appreciate the significance of the risk”steve wozniak has wondered publicly whether he is destined to be a family pet for robot overlords “we started feeding our dog filet” he told me about his own pet over lunch with his wife janet at the original hick’ry pit in walnut creek “once you start thinking you could be one that’s how you want them treated”he has developed a policy of appeasement toward robots and any ai masters “why do we want to set ourselves up as the enemy when they might overpower us someday” he said “it should be a joint partnership all we can do is seed them with a strong culture where they see humans as their friends”when i went to peter thiel’s elegant san francisco office dominated by two giant chessboards thiel one of the original donors to openai and a committed contrarian said he worried that musk’s resistance could actually be accelerating ai research because his endoftheworld warnings are increasing interest in the field“fullon ai is on the order of magnitude of extraterrestrials landing” thiel said “there are some very deeply tricky questions around this if you really push on how do we make ai safe i don’t think people have any clue we don’t even know what ai is it’s very hard to know how it would be controllable”he went on “there’s some sense in which the ai question encapsulates all of people’s hopes and fears about the computer age i think people’s intuitions do just really break down when they’re pushed to these limits because we’ve never dealt with entities that are smarter than humans on this planet”trying to puzzle out who is right on ai i drove to san mateo to meet ray kurzweil for coffee at the restaurant three kurzweil is the author of the singularity is near a utopian vision of what an ai future holds when i mentioned to andrew ng that i was going to be talking to kurzweil he rolled his eyes “whenever i read kurzweil’s singularity my eyes just naturally do that” he said kurzweil arrived with a whole foods bag for me brimming with his books and two documentaries about him he was wearing khakis a greenandred plaid shirt and several rings including one—made with a 3d printer—that has an s for his singularity universitycomputers are already “doing many attributes of thinking” kurzweil told me “just a few years ago ai couldn’t even tell the difference between a dog and cat now it can” kurzweil has a keen interest in cats and keeps a collection of 300 cat figurines in his northern california home at the restaurant he asked for almond milk but couldn’t get any the 69yearold eats strange health concoctions and takes 90 pills a day eager to achieve immortality—or “indefinite extensions to the existence of our mind file”—which means merging with machines he has such an urge to merge that he sometimes uses the word “we” when talking about superintelligent future beings—a far cry from musk’s more ominous “they”i mentioned that musk had told me he was bewildered that kurzweil doesn’t seem to have “even 1 percent doubt” about the hazards of our “mind children” as robotics expert hans moravec calls them“that’s just not true i’m the one who articulated the dangers” kurzweil said “the promise and peril are deeply intertwined” he continued “fire kept us warm and cooked our food and also burned down our houses furthermore there are strategies to control the peril as there have been with biotechnology guidelines” he summarized the three stages of the human response to new technology as wow uhoh and what other choice do we have but to move forward “the list of things humans can do better than computers is getting smaller and smaller” he said “but we create these tools to extend our long reach”just as two hundred million years ago mammalian brains developed a neocortex that eventually enabled humans to “invent language and science and art and technology” by the 2030s kurzweil predicts we will be cyborgs with nanobots the size of blood cells connecting us to synthetic neocortices in the cloud giving us access to virtual reality and augmented reality from within our own nervous systems “we will be funnier we will be more musical we will increase our wisdom” he said ultimately as i understand it producing a herd of beethovens and einsteins nanobots in our veins and arteries will cure diseases and heal our bodies from the insidehe allows that musk’s bête noire could come true he notes that our ai progeny “may be friendly and may not be” and that “if it’s not friendly we may have to fight it” and perhaps the only way to fight it would be “to get an ai on your side that’s even smarter”kurzweil told me he was surprised that stuart russell had “jumped on the peril bandwagon” so i reached out to russell and met with him in his seventhfloor office in berkeley the 54yearold britishamerican expert on ai told me that his thinking had evolved and that he now “violently” disagrees with kurzweil and others who feel that ceding the planet to superintelligent ai is just finerussell doesn’t give a fig whether ai might enable more einsteins and beethovens one more ludwig doesn’t balance the risk of destroying humanity “as if somehow intelligence was the thing that mattered and not the quality of human experience” he said with exasperation “i think if we replaced ourselves with machines that as far as we know would have no conscious existence no matter how many amazing things they invented i think that would be the biggest possible tragedy” nick bostrom has called the idea of a society of technological awesomeness with no human beings a “disneyland without children”“there are people who believe that if the machines are more intelligent than we are then they should just have the planet and we should go away” russell said “then there are people who say ‘well we’ll upload ourselves into the machines so we’ll still have consciousness but we’ll be machines’ which i would find well completely implausible”russell took exception to the views of yann lecun who developed the forerunner of the convolutional neural nets used by alphago and is facebook’s director of ai research lecun told the bbc that there would be no ex machina or terminator scenarios because robots would not be built with human drives—hunger power reproduction selfpreservation “yann lecun keeps saying that there’s no reason why machines would have any selfpreservation instinct” russell said “and it’s simply and mathematically false i mean it’s so obvious that a machine will have selfpreservation even if you don’t program it in because if you say ‘fetch the coffee’ it can’t fetch the coffee if it’s dead so if you give it any goal whatsoever it has a reason to preserve its own existence to achieve that goal and if you threaten it on your way to getting coffee it’s going to kill you because any risk to the coffee has to be countered people have explained this to lecun in very simple terms”russell debunked the two most common arguments for why we shouldn’t worry “one is it’ll never happen which is like saying we are driving towards the cliff but we’re bound to run out of gas before we get there and that doesn’t seem like a good way to manage the affairs of the human race and the other is not to worry—we will just build robots that collaborate with us and we’ll be in humanrobot teams which begs the question if your robot doesn’t agree with your objectives how do you form a team with it”last year microsoft shut down its ai chatbot tay after twitter users—who were supposed to make “her” smarter “through casual and playful conversation” as microsoft put it—instead taught her how to reply with racist misogynistic and antisemitic slurs “bush did 911 and hitler would have done a better job than the monkey we have now” tay tweeted “donald trump is the only hope we’ve got” in response musk tweeted “will be interesting to see what the mean time to hitler is for these bots only took microsoft’s tay a day”with trump now president musk finds himself walking a fine line his companies count on the us government for business and subsidies regardless of whether marcus aurelius or caligula is in charge musk’s companies joined the amicus brief against trump’s executive order regarding immigration and refugees and musk himself tweeted against the order at the same time unlike uber’s travis kalanick musk has hung in there as a member of trump’s strategic and policy forum “it’s very elon” says ashlee vance “he’s going to do his own thing no matter what people grumble about” he added that musk can be “opportunistic” when necessaryi asked musk about the flak he had gotten for associating with trump in the photograph of tech executives with trump he had looked gloomy and there was a weary tone in his voice when he talked about the subject in the end he said “it’s better to have voices of moderation in the room with the president there are a lot of people kind of the hard left who essentially want to isolate—and not have any voice very unwise”eliezer yudkowsky is a highly regarded 37yearold researcher who is trying to figure out whether it’s possible in practice and not just in theory to point ai in any direction let alone a good one i met him at a japanese restaurant in berkeley“how do you encode the goal functions of an ai such that it has an off switch and it wants there to be an off switch and it won’t try to eliminate the off switch and it will let you press the off switch but it won’t jump ahead and press the off switch itself” he asked over an order of surfandturf rolls “and if it selfmodifies will it selfmodify in such a way as to keep the off switch we’re trying to work on that it’s not easy”i babbled about the heirs of klaatu hal and ultron taking over the internet and getting control of our banking transportation and military what about the replicants in blade runner who conspire to kill their creator yudkowsky held his head in his hands then patiently explained “the ai doesn’t have to take over the whole internet it doesn’t need drones it’s not dangerous because it has guns it’s dangerous because it’s smarter than us suppose it can solve the science technology of predicting protein structure from dna information then it just needs to send out a few emails to the labs that synthesize customized proteins soon it has its own molecular machinery building even more sophisticated molecular machines“if you want a picture of ai gone wrong don’t imagine marching humanoid robots with glowing red eyes imagine tiny invisible synthetic bacteria made of diamond with tiny onboard computers hiding inside your bloodstream and everyone else’s and then simultaneously they release one microgram of botulinum toxin everyone just falls over dead“only it won’t actually happen like that it’s impossible for me to predict exactly how we’d lose because the ai will be smarter than i am when you’re building something smarter than you you have to get it right on the first try”i thought back to my conversation with musk and altman don’t get sidetracked by the idea of killer robots musk said noting “the thing about ai is that it’s not the robot it’s the computer algorithm in the net so the robot would just be an end effector just a series of sensors and actuators ai is in the net the important thing is that if we do get some sort of runaway algorithm then the human ai collective can stop the runaway algorithm but if there’s large centralized ai that decides then there’s no stopping it”altman expanded upon the scenario “an agent that had full control of the internet could have far more effect on the world than an agent that had full control of a sophisticated robot our lives are already so dependent on the internet that an agent that had no body whatsoever but could use the internet really well would be far more powerful”even robots with a seemingly benign task could indifferently harm us “let’s say you create a selfimproving ai to pick strawberries” musk said “and it gets better and better at picking strawberries and picks more and more and it is selfimproving so all it really wants to do is pick strawberries so then it would have all the world be strawberry fields strawberry fields forever” no room for human beingsbut can they ever really develop a kill switch “i’m not sure i’d want to be the one holding the kill switch for some superpowered ai because you’d be the first thing it kills” musk repliedaltman tried to capture the chilling grandeur of what’s at stake “it’s a very exciting time to be alive because in the next few decades we are either going to head toward selfdestruction or toward human descendants eventually colonizing the universe”“right” musk said adding “if you believe the end is the heat death of the universe it really is all about the journey”the man who is so worried about extinction chuckled at his own extinction joke as h p lovecraft once wrote “from even the greatest of horrors irony is seldom absent”correction an earlier version of this story gave an incorrect date for the accident that killed the operator of a selfdriving tesla it happened in may

is designed for technical team leads architects engineering directors and project managers who influence innovation in their teamsmorgan im going to talk to you today about building agi so not just agi as science fiction but actually what it might take to build it if i do nothing else i hope ill spark your imagination a little bit basically the first question we have to ask is what is intelligence who here has actually asked themselves what is intelligence its a very very deep question yes a few well thats good so were starting to think about it as a society i guessand then ill move on and well talk about the hardware basically looking to biology for inspiration because thats our existence proof its us were intelligent supposedly some of us and then well say well how come we havent built them yet if all it takes us three pounds of wet matter in our skull whats so clever about nature what are we missing how far along that road are we and thats really the crux of my talkwho here has heard of deep learning hopefully all the hands go up this is what people think of as ai today and im going to show you its not ai at all but its narrow but thats okay maybe some people claiming it might get us there but well have a look at what were all doing maybe at work were using tensorflow that kind of stuff will that get us there is that part of the journey is it nothing to do with the journey then finally the heart of the talk will look at agi developments whats being done whats being built whos out there doing it and how far along the road are we actually have google built agi have deepmind have i whos doing it and where are wethe tldr too long didnt read it i basically believe that we can build agi systems in the next few years thats a bold claim so im going to have to spend the rest of my 40 minutes backing that up and were going to use a particular theory to do that why do we want to build agi in the first place who the hell would want to build the terminator thats just going to turn around and kill us why would we want to do that well thats one scenario thats the gloomy one thats a dystopic one but basically humans are driven by curiosity even if we said its going to kill us somebody in their bedroom would keep doing it because we have this insatiable drive its called curiositybut also were always pushing ahead were still here we havent wiped ourselves out so theres some sort of innate good in us the reason is if we build these intelligent systems like ourselves generally intelligent then we can use them to solve cancer to accelerate the pace of discovery in science cure alzheimers then if we get the algorithms right you can see quite quickly how we will scale just fill data centers full of these general intelligence algorithms on the right kind of hardware and suddenly weve got super intelligence it sounds a bit star trek but this is kind of the road were on im not sure if anyones thought about that or maybe just watched a dystopic movie they all seem pretty dystopic but this is really the road were on its the reason deepmind was set up in the first place they have about 800 people now so yes were sort of going for it its sort of unstoppable if you likewho here thinks that alphago speaking of deepmind is general intelligence not many i wont even bother asking you the rest weve got all these amazing achievements alphago alphastar starcraft deep blue chess ibm watson theyre superhuman theyre exceeding human level intelligence already unfortunately theyre all narrow ai so as incredible as these things are and theyre well televised and theyre big deals theyre just narrow ai just the algorithms theyre using if we use the algorithms that beat go we cant turn around and use it to play starcraftwhat are we missing what were missing is the big picture which is what is intelligence im going to answer that question for you now its not really a mystery if you think about it there are nine types of intelligence and this guy howard gardner at harvard i think in the 90s or 80s hes made his whole life career hes written about seven books you can buy them on amazon hes sort of come up with this definition i quite like so just basically he categorized them into nine types of intelligence what we see go alphago and the deep blue the chess the go the starcraft and the jeopardy these are all examples of logicalmathematical reasoning jeopardy you could argue is language as well but thats only two parts of intelligencethis thing up here does a lot more than that we have spatial we can navigate ill just go through them quickly because this is important to bear in mind for the whole talk really bodily we move around can we build robots like us not yet how does that work we have linguistic we have very creative writing reading writing that type of stuff shakespeare interpersonal i think weve got that one cracked so how we relate to one another how we relate to animals all that kind of stuff the sort of between agent to agent communication musical creating great symphonies operas rock music whatever type of music we like we can create that how does that work is that the same as language is that the same as math or is it something completely different going on or is it the samethese are the questions we have to ask and solve and then build this may be the first time youre thinking about it at this level but thats good because this is what people are doing who are working in this field existential why are we here i believe any researcher even from deepmind if they came along or google or amazon or whoever microsoft ibm who told me you know what ive built a system that asked why its here that hasnt happened yet as far as i know so whats going on there what part of the brain is doing that what is that and why why can we do thathave i missed any out im just having a quick look yes so thats it this is all we have to do small problem but maybe theres something in common about all those nine things to unify them together maybe theres one theory we dont know yet but by the end of the talk maybe ill have answered that question as wellhow far have we come well ive talked a little bit about that yes id say i put these figures down sort of put my finger in the air waved it around a little bit and said the logicalmathematical i think were about 50 there because we solve calculations computational systems can easily outcomputer so they can beat at go they can beat us at chess the worlds best no doubt about it but theyre not that creative can they come up with a new game no the answer is no i mean tops i think out of all those nine were about 50 and that goes down to 0 with the existential bit i just talked about we havent even started on that death journey so clearly were missing things” if you go through the list thats kind of where we arehow are we going to get there it takes a village to raise a child hopefully weve all heard of that it takes a village to create an agi so were going to need computer scientists software engineers like you guys in this room but were also going to need physics were going to need neuroscience were going to use psychology we need the whole shebang because we are intelligent how do we understand ourselves we have psychologists how do we understand whats going on the brain we have neuroscientists how do we understand how the neurons work and fire together we need physicists and we need computer scientists to build the things this isnt one tiny little group of people a bunch of physicists neuroscientist computer scientists this is everybody in the room talking together its a big problemits basically the challenge isnt it of the 21st century or of the human race in fact i think obviously worth a lot of money if you do solve this and start building it and you build super intelligent systems its kind of like thats the gdp of the world because we replaced ourselves thats kind of game over in a sense in a nice sense what do we do well we have to be creative and think what do we do who are we what do we want to do to fulfill ourselves but thats a question for another talk but thats what well be thinking about in the years to comewhere are we with the hardware the feet back on the ground nuts and bolts were going to look at biology for inspiration because thats what weve got and then well go on to the nonbiological hardware but whats biology done biology has been very clever its come up its had a little bit of time it had a headstart on us 45 billion years one could argue we could go back to the big bang and trace the evolution but amoeba i think were about a million years ago singlecelled organisms that could wiggle around and move im arguing theyre intelligent because intelligent agents survive and reproduce these things can do it they might not be able to come up with the general theory of relativity they havent got a neocortex theyve only got one cell they havent even got a central nervous system but theyre still intelligent at some level theres intelligence herethe first creature or system with a central nervous system is c elegans 302 neurons and thats a simpler system we have we have actually recreated that in a lab weve got 300 neurons the human brain has like 100 billion were not quite there but the point is the principles might be similar so weve passed that landmark only a few years ago but we have passed it the bumblebees have got about a million neurons and weve got like i say 100 billionwhat can we learn from nature the first thing we learn is that nature is hierarchical we start off as molecules neurons collections of neurons its a hierarchical scale weve got about seven layers here up to the central nervous system the human brain project i think they look at six layers of a hierarchy and they have different teams in a point and the trick is to integrate all these levels together into a systemwith computer architecture as we talked about distributed systems here maybe the cns is like all the amazon data centers connected together but within each data center youve got clusters within each cluster youve got server racks within each server youve got cpu gpu asics and within them youve got loads of subprocessors like the intel has many 32 whatever it is processors on a chip nvidia has something like 1000 5000 8000 processors on a chip again its hierarchical similar thing but not generally intelligentwhat are we missing there i pretty much covered the next few slides i think what i just said so hierarchical if you look at the individual neurons theyre super complex do we have to go down to that level were not quite sure yet but nature has done some pretty tricky clever things but we dont know if we really need to go down to that level well seenext level up this is a level we probably will have to get right is the neurons themselves we have sensory neurons that detect information coming in because after all i could say all we are in quotation we are just information processing systems we process information just like any computer weve ever built any processor von neumann architecture nonvon neumann architecture with the memory and the cpu separated or together these are information processing systems my iphones an information processing system similarly our brain and similarly the brain of the bumblebee the rat these are all just information processing systemsso how do we build a generally intelligent information processing system well heres how nature does it it has neurons essentially they basically process information coming in whether thats visible light sound waves on our eardrums vision light on our retinas taste and smell chemicals on our tongue and on our nose the olfactory system and touch the sense of touch so that information is processed by some sort of interneuron and then output into action muscular action and thats the bodily partthats all we have to do really is to say it sounds simple doesnt it so how does nature do it can we do it what are we missing” because clearly were not there the other thing to notice is that neurons theres about a thousand different types then also theres some substructure here they seem to repeat about 2 million times these cortical columns weve come a long way with neuroscience measurements fmri scans all the different types of scans eeg meg fmri so a lot of this like any science even the semiconductor transistor all the physics chemistry biology its observation where do we start we use the scientific method we look with our eyes we measure stuffwere a little bit dependent on our measurement resolution becoming better and better so we can see the neurons what theyre actually doing were down so we can see single neurons firing and what theyre doing we can see thoughts we can see people dreaming we can put them in cat scans were getting down to the single neuron level but we still cant build a generally intelligent system or no ones done it we are missing the theory you might say the observations are getting to the point where we can trace individual thoughts but we also need a theory and eventually to build and to guidewhere are we there well look at that at the very end of the talk final scale a connectome and then after that the central nervous the whole body societys social systems are hierarchical as well if were looking at computation building it in silicon were thinking about swarm robotics cloud robotics but thats the last layer of the hierarchylets see weve covered biology lets look at digital moving right along theres a timeline as software engineers computer scientists im sure were kind of familiar with the timeline so i wont go into too much detail computation isnt a new idea its not even a hundred years old its about 5000 years old where we started building abacuses to compute stuff to help us count grain and trade whatever we used to do 5000 years ago the abacus funnily enough was in all different regions of the world it didnt just happen in one place and spread this is about the same time over centuries in china in africa and middle east we all were building computation around the same millenniathis is part of the track that i talked about were just on this journey its like this force that is bigger than us curiosity we need to compute we need to understand nature as a world we need to build things that help us do that so weve come from there charles babbage the difference engine you can go and see it at the london science museum the analytic engine ada lovelace supposedly one of the first programmers this was around 1830sish these dates are approximate vacuum tubes around 1900s alan turing laid down the theory of computation basically in the 30s alonzo church at princeton he went over to princeton they worked together with the churchturing thesis so that works kind of been done the computational theoretical work von neumann also during the war and after eniac the first big transistor computer really some might consider that the start of the computer age what’s that about 70 years agoso havent been doing it long from 5 000 to 70 weve only been doing this 70 years so maybe we shouldnt be too hard on ourselves that we havent solved this problem of general intelligence in seven years weve come a long way weve got the eniac and the iphone times a billion or something so weve done well in that respect weve done well at narrow ai the transistor bell labs a nobel prize for that intel 68 thats only 50 years ago its not long at all right less than a half century halfcentury or so 1990 thats very recent history less than 30 years nvidia and asics google tpu which is used for deep learning machine learning they just built that a few years agothats bringing us right up to date we still havent built agi though so what are we missing again weve just got different types of processes for different types of information processing word processing the cpus are good at gpus are good for graphics and matrix modification which just so happens deep learning in these machine learning algorithms are just basically multiplying massive matrices gpus are exceptionally good there but its not general intelligence thats what we use to play go and also googles tpu just checking on the time googles tpu that is just narrow ai but that the point here is that we build the processor for the actual use case i think i have to speed up a little bitthis is a bit of a whistle to historic journey theres the cray 40 years ago 1976 160 megaflops today state of the art that i9 series tpu as i mentioned the graphical ipu which is basically just a matrix multiplier so this is all digital technology in the nvidia v100 then theres state of the art 100 petaflops supercomputer those are just 8 racks of tpus thats where weve come state of the art it wont give us general intelligence but its really good at playing go and other things starcraft that type of stuff exceptionally good superhuman level but it doesnt ask itself why am i here why am i sitting in this data center why am i a google tpu core why who made methe state of the art three exaflops so thats were up to way more than what the brain does about petaflops we went out to 1000 x that so its more horsepower that brute computation isnt going to get us there either what are we missing the brains about threepound petaflops about 30 watt like a light bulb that thing there thats 30 million thats a million x thats a million light bulbs we do all of that well we dont do all that we do different stuff on 30 watts so its very energyefficient and we do all these other things tooso perhaps we should be looking at biology looking at bioplausible architectures it seems obvious now im saying it but maybe not so if you havent really thought about it so muchintroducing your morphic computing now this is a type of computing that is bioinspired and its available on the cloud its called the spinnaker project started by steve furber 20 years ago where he left arm hes one of the cofounders of arm based at the university of manchester these spinnaker systems are based up in manchester theyve been folded into the human brain project i suggest you log in you go home during the break and log in and set up an account and use them so they exist theyre not these weird far off in the future things theyve been available to the public for about three years now you have to present a case whether its an academic case or a business case but they want people to use them they want to test the hardware because theyve spent 20 years building it they want people to use itnow these things are literally a thousand times more energy efficient so they use 30000 watts instead of 30 million theyre definitely bioinspired instead of having a von neumann architecture where you have the compute and the memory apart you have them together just like the brain does the neurons both compute systems and memory systems togetherthis might get us to general intelligence if we put the right algorithms on them so thats what they look like its five cabinets in a data center in manchester theyre real thats what they look like theyve been built theyve been processed theyve been put off to fabs built brought back to manchester put together they work were up to about a billion neurons which is about a mouse brain not quite human level but they can do things that mice do they can navigate through mazes they can play sudoku like we do they do crossword puzzles they do things that alphago cannot do and never can do and never will do so this architecture is very importantthats how you scale them theres the brain scales effort thats a german effort i forget which university they are it might be munich but there are several of these ibm have one called truenorth you may have heard of that and theres a rack of google tpus ones really good at playing go the other one can do a lot of different things like humans do and about a thousand times more energyefficient so yes so the hardware is importantwhat about quantum computing probably not the brain is wet and mushy and warm in its room temperature thats there so well skip to that impressive id love to spend the rest of my talk on them i am giving a talk tomorrow on quantum computing by the way come and see it at 300 ibm 50 qubits google bristlecone and 72 qubits thats what a quantum circuit looks like it looks a little bit like a classical one but it uses the laws of quantum mechanicsprobably not going to be needed although quantum intelligence what does that even mean the point really is that in summary there’s not just one stack thats there there are four theres neuromorphic theres classical which is digital theres quantum and theres biological so different stacks different types of processors which ones are we going to need which ones wont we need thats what they look like theres a 7 qubit quantum computer processor from ibm thats what biology looks like thats what neuromorphic looks like at the microscopic level thats what digital looks liketheres three stacks and thats what the data center of the future will look like itll be filled with quantum computers you can log into a quantum computer today at ibm go home and log in you can log into neuromorphic computers in 5 or 10 years the data centers wont just be full of racks of cpu gpu tpus theyll be full of neuromorphics full of quantum chipsdeep learning im going to argue we dont need it so well skip through these slides in the interest of time the fourth industrial revolution which were in very exciting times will be open source which is great thats accelerating progress too fantastic and so agi what is it what do we need i mentioned active entrance what the hell is that are we building it yet have we gone beyond the spinnaker neuromorphic where are we on that journeyi am going to argue right here and now on this stage in london today that we are needing physics whatever machine learning or statistical stuff isnt going to get us anywhere its just statistical alphago fantastic very clever not undermining it taking anything away but its not based on physics at all zero physics its just statistical its very damn clever superhuman level but only narrow and thats why its just using statistics on a very narrow data set were going to need physics what is physics i did a phd in physics in postdoc level so i know what physics is and what physics is is that we use something called the principle of least action and that will be the last part of my talk by minimizing this thing its just heres what it is its the integral of a lagrangian whos heard of lagrangian so its basically thatnow the tricky part is to come up with the right lagrangian we basically want the lagrangian of the brain now what the heck does that look like well thats where we have to turn to neuroscience remember when i said it takes a village well we have to ask the neuroscientists how does the brain work and so this is exactly what we do so the pinnacle of human achievement weve written down the laws of physics for everything except for dark matter which came along unexpectedly what the hell is that but there it is thats the whole history of physics in one equation that long pinnacle of i would argue the pinnacle of human achievementhow do we apply that to the brain well there are nine types of intelligence so we need a system that can explain and understand the world it can imagine things it can problemsolve and plan actions and it can build models of its environment thats what intelligence is true intelligence something that can model its environment not just a game of go but anything climb a mountain and understand that get in the car and understand that go shopping come to a conference write some code write a book draw a picture it needs to understand its environment do all those thingswere going to have to look at neuroscience were going to have to get the theory from there the observation from there were probably going to have to use neuromorphic processing which we have waiting for them to scale there are a bunch of theoretical approaches so these are all super clever groups and super clever people and theyve all been spending at least 30 years on this stuff bialeks at princeton fristons at ucl up the road tishbys in israel schmidhubers in switzerland same as hutter but he went to australia so all these super intelligent groups its not just deepmind working on this it is a whole bunch of people extraordinarily for me the most interesting question you can ask it honestly is the fields attracted a lot of very bright people alreadyprofessor friston up the road at ucl has come up with something called active inference and he uses physics and information theory as a starting point see thats why im choosing his theory in particular but you can look at other ones you can go look at schmidhuber bialek you can google that on the internet theyre all fascinating what work theyre doing but i think professor friston has probably got the right theory in my opinionits called active inference it gets quite technical and ive only got a few minutes left but its basically physics is entropy free energy action perception thats how we set it up we have our internal states which is inside the information processing system whether thats a chip or a neuromorphic processor or our brains biological brain we have the external world which is what we call the external state so we have whats inside us doing the processing the information coming in from the external world if anyones ever done reinforcement learning its very similar agent action in the world except reinforcement learnings based on statistics this is based on physics in the middle we have the markov blanket and that separates the internal states from the external statesthe math gets ugly real quick as you might expect the math does get ugly real quick who here read machine learning deep learning reinforcement learning paper yes the math gets like that it looks like that except its based on statistics this has got physics terms in it its got free energy its got entropy all that good stuff you drill down you unpack that and you get loads of integrals and yes statistical functions and stochastic differential equations and all that good stuff but if you look at the theory of general relativity on the surface its like one beautiful equation but if you dig down it gets messy real quick so this has to be expected you cant just expect someone to walk off the street and go yes heres how the brain works and heres the equations its hardlets see this is it applied to the brain thats the last equation of the day i promise but the big point here is that it works from cells to the brain you have internal state of a cell external states markov blanket separating the two internal states of the brain external states markov blanket separating the two so its very general it works at all scales all time scales all length scales societal scales its a very general theory its like the general theory of relativity it works on all scales all time scales all distance scalesso can we build agi yes we have the theories we have all these very smart people we have great theories that one in particular we have algorithms and software we have a lot of math you saw the math theres code to go along with that math we have hardware neuromorphics and asics and we have data sets we have the internet we have all the data we need so were getting there were not that far away this is the reason for my talk and probably why martin invited me its that were not that far away as far away you might think its a process its a procedure but i believe we have the key elements the key understanding to do itwhen lets see well i think were at the beginning now there are a whole bunch of projects theres some you can go and google them so in conclusion there are a few more slides but almost there its obvious to most that deep learning is lacking the foundations needed for a general theory of intelligence so dont let anyone tell you that deep learning is any part of intelligence its not its statistics its based on statistics not physics active inference is such a theory of general intelligence im getting you to sort of start thinking through this process you choose your favorite theory but its the same processdeep learning research groups are now finally turning to biology for inspiration bioplausible models are starting to appear some people were working on this 30 years ago but the deep learning community in general the scurves flattening its like the mileage just ran out basically so what do we do now this huge community you go to nips theres 10000 20000 at this conference where they used to be a few hundred its like were going to have to look for something else the community is starting to think along these terms bioplausible systems and so thats where we arethe tldr again were going to build them soon ill just finish off with geoff hinton who is the godfather of deep learning has been doing this for 30 years he used to work with carl friston at ucl then he went to the us did a postdoc there then he helped set up the gatsby lab where deepmind came from along with friston and a few others then he ended up in canada lets see what he has to say“geoffrey hinton so whats kind of interesting at present is that it looks so we might be in a phase of normal science where business as usual is going to make a whole lot of progress you know assuming the computer industry can keep producing better hardware and keep doing computations burning less energy if they can keep doing that with moores law for another 10 years or 20 years i think business as usual is going to take us a huge way obviously if we get big breakthroughs big conceptual breakthroughs thatll take us further”i think one of the big breakthroughs thats going to come is were going to understand the brain this is just a bet my personal belief is were going to get close enough to how the brain really does do these things that suddenly it all begins to click and we kind of fall into a minimum where its just obvious how the brain is actually doing this stuff i think we might be quite close to that and that will be another revolution because that would affect all sorts of things like education and our sense of who we are that would be very exciting im hoping i get to see thatmorgan great he said this back in 2016 thats three years ago so yes we were close back then were closer now trust me i wrote a report for oreilly there it is i am trying to commercialize this stuff with professor friston theres my disclaimer i have a company called turing ai and come and see me at the ama at 1035 we can talk more about this very fascinating subject thank you very muchsee more

agreement as to what constitutes intelligence interpretations of what it means to be intelligent vary yet most can be categorized in one of three ways intelligence can be thought of as a quality an individually held property that is separable from all other properties of the human person intelligence is also seen in the functions one performs in actions or the ability to carry out certain tasks finally some researchers see intelligence as a quality that can only be acquired and demonstrated through relationship with other intelligent beings each of these understandings of intelligence has been used as the basis of an approach to developing computer programs with intelligent characteristicspropertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent1 the field of ai is considered to have its origin in the publication of british mathematician alan turings 1912–1954 paper computing machinery and intelligence 1950 the term itself was coined six years later by mathematician and computer scientist john mccarthy b 1927 at a summer conference at dartmouth college in new hampshire the earliest approach to ai is called symbolic or classical ai and is predicated on the hypothesis that every process in which either a human being or a machine engages can be expressed by a string of symbols that is modifiable according to a limited set of rules that can be logically defined just as geometry can be built from a finite set of axioms and primitive objects such as points and lines so symbolicists following rationalist philosophers such as ludwig wittgenstein 1889–1951 and alfred north whitehead 1861–1947 predicated that human thought is represented in the mind by concepts that can be broken down into basic rules and primitive objects simple concepts or objects are directly expressed by a single symbol while more complex ideas are the product of many symbols combined by certain rules for a symbolicist any patternable kind of matter can thus represent intelligent thought symbolic ai met with immediate success in areas in which problems could be easily described using a limited domain of objects that operate in a highly rulebased manner such as games the game of chess takes place in a world where the only objects are thirtytwo pieces moving on a sixtyfour square board according to a limited number of rules the limited options this world provides give the computer the potential to look far ahead examining all possible moves and countermoves looking for a sequence that will leave its pieces in the most advantageous position other successes for symbolic ai occurred rapidly in similarly restricted domains such as medical diagnosis mineral prospecting chemical analysis and mathematical theorem proving symbolic ai faltered however not on difficult problems like passing a calculus exam but on the easy things a two year old child can do such as recognizing a face in various settings or understanding a simple story mccarthy labels symbolic programs as brittle because they crack or break down at the edges they cannot function outside or near the edges of their domain of expertise since they lack knowledge outside of that domain knowledge that most human experts possess in the form of what is known as common sense humans make use of general knowledge—the millions of things that are known and applied to a situation—both consciously and subconsciously should it exist it is now clear to ai researchers that the set of primitive facts necessary for representing human knowledge is exceedingly large propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent2 another critique of symbolic ai advanced by terry winograd and fernando flores in their 1986 book understanding computers and cognition is that human intelligence may not be a process of symbol manipulation humans do not carry mental models around in their heads hubert dreyfus makes a similar argument in mind over machine 1986 he suggests that human experts do not arrive at their solutions to problems through the application of rules or the manipulation of symbols but rather use intuition acquired through multiple experiences in the real world he describes symbolic ai as a degenerating research project by which he means that while promising at first it has produced fewer results as time has progressed and is likely to be abandoned should other alternatives become available this prediction has proven fairly accurate by 2000 the once dominant symbolic approach had been all but abandoned in ai with only one major ongoing project douglas lenats cyc pronounced psych lenat hopes to overcome the general knowledge problem by providing an extremely large base of primitive facts lenat plans to combine this large database with the ability to communicate in a natural language hoping that once enough information is entered into cyc the computer will be able to continue the learning process on its own through conversation reading and applying logical rules to detect patterns or inconsistencies in the data cyc is given initially conceived in 1984 as a tenyear initiative cyc has not yet shown convincing evidence of extended independent learning functional or weak ai in 1980 john searle in the paper minds brains and programs introduced a division of the field of ai into strong and weak ai strong ai denoted the attempt to develop a full humanlike intelligence while weak ai denoted the use of ai techniques to either better understand human reasoning or to solve more limited problems although there was little progress in developing a strong ai through symbolic programming methods the attempt to program computers to carry out limited human functions has been quite successful much of what is currently labeled ai research follows a functional model applying particular programming techniques such as knowledge engineering fuzzy logic genetic algorithms neural networking heuristic searching and machine learning via statistical methods to practical problems this view sees ai as advanced computing it produces working programs that can take over certain human tasks such programs are used in manufacturing operations transportation education financial markets smart buildings and even household appliances for a functional ai there need be no quality labeled intelligence that is shared by humans and computers all computers need do is perform a task that requires intelligence for a human to perform it is also unnecessary in functional ai to model a program after the thought processes that humans use if results are what matters then it is possible to exploit the speed and storage capabilities of the digital computer while ignoring parts of human thought that are not understood or easily modeled such as intuition this is in fact what was done in designing the chessplaying program deep blue which in 1997 beat the reigning world chess champion gary kasparov deep blue does not attempt to mimic the thought of a human chess player instead it capitalizes on the strengths of the computer by examining an extremely large number of moves more moves than any human player could possibly examine propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent3 there are two problems with functional ai the first is the difficulty of determining what falls into the category of ai and what is simply a normal computer application a definition of ai that includes any program that accomplishes some function normally done by a human being would encompass virtually all computer programs nor is there agreement among computer scientists as to what sorts of programs should fall under the rubric of ai once an application is mastered there is a tendency to no longer define that application as ai for example while game playing is one of the classical fields of ai deep blues design team emphatically states that deep blue is not artificial intelligence since it uses standard programming and parallel processing techniques that are in no way designed to mimic human thought the implication here is that merely programming a computer to complete a human task is not ai if the computer does not complete the task in the same way a human would for a functional approach to result in a full humanlike intelligence it would be necessary not only to specify which functions make up intelligence but also to make sure those functions are suitably congruent with one another functional ai programs are rarely designed to be compatible with other programs each uses different techniques and methods the sum of which is unlikely to capture the whole of human intelligence many in the ai community are also dissatisfied with a collection of taskoriented programs the building of a general humanlike intelligence as difficult a goal as it may seem remains the vision a relational approach a third approach is to consider intelligence as acquired held and demonstrated only through relationships with other intelligent agents in computing machinery and intelligence 1997 turing addresses the question of which functions are essential for intelligence with a proposal for what has come to be the generally accepted test for machine intelligence an human interrogator is connected by terminal to two subjects one a human and the other a machine if the interrogator fails as often as he or she succeeds in determining which is the human and which the machine the machine could be considered as having intelligence the turing test is not based on the completion of tasks or the solution of problems by the machine but on the machines ability to relate to a human being in conversation discourse is unique among human activities in that it subsumes all other activities within itself turing predicted that by the year 2000 there would be computers that could fool an interrogator at least thirty percent of the time this like most predictions in ai was overly optimistic no computer has yet come close to passing the turing test propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent4 the turing test uses relational discourse to demonstrate intelligence however turing also notes the importance of being in relationship for the acquisition of knowledge or intelligence he estimates that the programming of the background knowledge needed for a restricted form of the game would take at a minimum three hundred personyears to complete this is assuming that the appropriate knowledge set could be identified at the outset turing suggests that rather than trying to imitate an adult mind computer scientists should attempt to construct a mind that simulates that of a child such a mind when given an appropriate education would learn and develop into an adult mind one ai researcher taking this approach is rodney brooks of the massachusetts institute of technology whose lab has constructed several robots including cog and kismet that represent a new direction in ai in which embodiedness is crucial to the robots design their programming is distributed among the various physical parts each joint has a small processor that controls movement of that joint these processors are linked with faster processors that allow for interaction between joints and for movement of the robot as a whole these robots are designed to learn tasks associated with human infants such as eyehand coordination grasping an object and face recognition through social interaction with a team of researchers although the robots have developed abilities such as tracking moving objects with the eyes or withdrawing an arm when touched brookss project is too new to be assessed it may be no more successful than lenats cyc in producing a machine that could interact with humans on the level of the turing test however brookss work represents a movement toward turings opinion that intelligence is socially acquired and demonstrated the turing test makes no assumptions as to how the computer arrives at its answers there need be no similarity in internal functioning between the computer and the human brain however an area of ai that shows some promise is that of neural networks systems of circuitry that reproduce the patterns of neurons found in the brain current neural nets are limited however the human brain has billions of neurons and researchers have yet to understand both how these neurons are connected and how the various neurotransmitting chemicals in the brain function despite these limitations neural nets have reproduced interesting behaviors in areas such as speech or image recognition naturallanguage processing and learning some researchers including hans moravec and raymond kurzweil see neural net research as a way to reverse engineer the brain they hope that once scientists can design nets with a complexity equal to the human brain the nets will have the same power as the brain and develop consciousness as an emergent property kurzweil posits that such mechanical brains when programmed with a given persons memories and talents could form a new path to immortality while moravec holds out hope that such machines might some day become our evolutionary children capable of greater abilities than humans currently demonstrate ai in science fiction a truly intelligent computer remains in the realm of speculation though researchers have continually projected that intelligent computers are immanent progress in ai has been limited computers with intentionality and self consciousness with fully human reasoning skills or the ability to be in relationship exist only in the realm of dreams and desires a realm explored in fiction and fantasy propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent5 the artificially intelligent computer in science fiction story and film is not a prop but a character one that has become a staple since the mid1950s these characters are embodied in a variety of physical forms ranging from the wholly mechanical computers and robots to the partially mechanical cyborgs and the completely biological androids a general trend from the 1950s to the 1990s has been to depict intelligent computers in an increasingly anthropomorphic way the robots and computers of early films such as maria in fritz langs metropolis 1926 robby in fred wilcoxs forbidden planet 1956 hal in stanley kubricks 2001 a space odyssey 1968 or r2d2 and c3po in george lucass star wars 1977 were clearly constructs of metal on the other hand early science fiction stories such as isaac asimovs i robot 1950 explored the question of how one might distinguish between robots that looked human and actual human beings films and stories from the 1980s through the early 2000s including ridley scotts blade runner 1982 and stephen spielbergs ai 2001 pick up this question depicting machines with both mechanical and biological parts that are far less easily distinguished from human beings fiction that features ai can be classified in two general categories cautionary tales ai 2001 or tales of wish fulfillment star wars i robot these present two differing visions of the artificially intelligent being as a rival to be feared or as a friendly and helpful companion philosophical and theological questions what rights would an intelligent robot have will artificially intelligent computers eventually replace human beings should scientists discontinue research in fields such as artificial intelligence or nanotechnology in order to safeguard future lives when a computer malfunctions who is responsible these are only some of the ethical and theological questions that arise when one considers the possibility of success in the development of an artificial intelligence the prospect of an artificially intelligent computer also raises questions about the nature of human beings are humans simply machines themselves at what point would replacing some or all human biological parts with mechanical components violate ones integrity as a human being is a human beings relationship to god at all contingent on human biological nature if humans are not the end point of evolution what does this say about human nature what is the relationship of the soul to consciousness or intelligence while most of these questions are speculative in nature regarding a future that may or may not come to be they remain relevant for the way people live and the ways in which they view their lives stand to be critically altered by technology the quest for artificial intelligence reveals much about how people view

succeeds in determining which is the human and which the machine the machine could be considered as having intelligence the turing test is not based on the completion of tasks or the solution of problems by the machine but on the machines ability to relate to a human being in conversation discourse is unique among human activities in that it subsumes all other activities within itself turing predicted that by the year 2000 there would be computers that could fool an interrogator at least thirty percent of the time this like most predictions in ai was overly optimistic no computer has yet come close to passing the turing test propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent4 the turing test uses relational discourse to demonstrate intelligence however turing also notes the importance of being in relationship for the acquisition of knowledge or intelligence he estimates that the programming of the background knowledge needed for a restricted form of the game would take at a minimum three hundred personyears to complete this is assuming that the appropriate knowledge set could be identified at the outset turing suggests that rather than trying to imitate an adult mind computer scientists should attempt to construct a mind that simulates that of a child such a mind when given an appropriate education would learn and develop into an adult mind one ai researcher taking this approach is rodney brooks of the massachusetts institute of technology whose lab has constructed several robots including cog and kismet that represent a new direction in ai in which embodiedness is crucial to the robots design their programming is distributed among the various physical parts each joint has a small processor that controls movement of that joint these processors are linked with faster processors that allow for interaction between joints and for movement of the robot as a whole these robots are designed to learn tasks associated with human infants such as eyehand coordination grasping an object and face recognition through social interaction with a team of researchers although the robots have developed abilities such as tracking moving objects with the eyes or withdrawing an arm when touched brookss project is too new to be assessed it may be no more successful than lenats cyc in producing a machine that could interact with humans on the level of the turing test however brookss work represents a movement toward turings opinion that intelligence is socially acquired and demonstrated the turing test makes no assumptions as to how the computer arrives at its answers there need be no similarity in internal functioning between the computer and the human brain however an area of ai that shows some promise is that of neural networks systems of circuitry that reproduce the patterns of neurons found in the brain current neural nets are limited however the human brain has billions of neurons and researchers have yet to understand both how these neurons are connected and how the various neurotransmitting chemicals in the brain function despite these limitations neural nets have reproduced interesting behaviors in areas such as speech or image recognition naturallanguage processing and learning some researchers including hans moravec and raymond kurzweil see neural net research as a way to reverse engineer the brain they hope that once scientists can design nets with a complexity equal to the human brain the nets will have the same power as the brain and develop consciousness as an emergent property kurzweil posits that such mechanical brains when programmed with a given persons memories and talents could form a new path to immortality while moravec holds out hope that such machines might some day become our evolutionary

science fiction story and film is not a prop but a character one that has become a staple since the mid1950s these characters are embodied in a variety of physical forms ranging from the wholly mechanical computers and robots to the partially mechanical cyborgs and the completely biological androids a general trend from the 1950s to the 1990s has been to depict intelligent computers in an increasingly anthropomorphic way the robots and computers of early films such as maria in fritz langs metropolis 1926 robby in fred wilcoxs forbidden planet 1956 hal in stanley kubricks 2001 a space

into the category of ai and what is simply a normal computer application a definition of ai that includes any program that accomplishes some function normally done by a human being would encompass virtually all computer programs nor is there agreement among computer scientists as to what sorts of programs should fall under the rubric of ai once an application is mastered there is a tendency to no longer define that application as ai for example while game playing is one of the classical fields of ai deep blues design team emphatically states that deep blue is not artificial intelligence since it uses standard programming and parallel processing techniques that are in no way designed to mimic human thought the implication here is that merely programming a computer to complete a human task is not ai if the computer does not complete the task in the same way a human wouldfor a functional approach to result in a full humanlike intelligence it would be necessary not only to specify which functions make up intelligence but also to make sure those functions are suitably congruent with one another functional ai programs are rarely designed to be compatible with other programs each uses different techniques and methods the sum of which is unlikely to capture the whole of human intelligence many in the ai community are also dissatisfied with a collection of taskoriented programs the building of a general humanlike intelligence as difficult a goal as it may seem remains the visiona third approach is to consider intelligence as acquired held and demonstrated only through relationships with other intelligent agents in computing machinery and intelligence 1997 turing addresses the question of which functions are essential for intelligence with a proposal for what has

“intelligence” is difficult to define and has been the subject of heated debate by philosophers educators and psychologists for ages nevertheless it is possible to enumerate many important characteristics of intelligent behavior intelligence includes the capacity to learn maintain a large storehouse of knowledge utilize commonsense reasoning apply analytical abilities discern relationships between facts communicate ideas to others and understand communications from others and perceive and make sense of the world around us thus artificial intelligence systems are computer programs that exhibit one or more of these behaviorsai systems can be divided into two broad categories knowledge representation systems and machine learning systems knowledge representation systems also known as expert systems provide a structure for capturing and encoding the knowledge of a human expert in a particular domain for example the knowledge of medical doctors might be captured in a computerized model that can be used to help diagnose patient illnessespropertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent12 the second category of ai machine learning systems creates new knowledge by finding previously unknown patterns in data in contrast to knowledge representation approaches which model the problemsolving structure of human experts machine learning systems derive solutions by “learning” patterns in data with little or no intervention by an expert there are three main machine learning techniques neural networks induction algorithms and genetic algorithms neural networks neural networks simulate the human nervous system the concepts that guide neural network research and practice stem from studies of biological systems these systems model the interaction between nerve cells components of a neural network include neurons sometimes called “processing elements” input lines to the neurons called dendrites and output lines from the neurons called axons neural networks are composed of richly connected sets of neurons forming layers the neural network architecture consists of an input layer which inputs data to the network an output layer which produces the resulting guess of the network and a series of one or more hidden layers which assist in propagating this is illustrated in figure 1 during processing each neuron performs a weighted sum of inputs from the neurons connecting to it this is called activation the neuron chooses to fire if the sum of inputs exceeds some previously set threshold value this is called transfer inputs with high weights tend to give greater activation to a neuron than inputs with low weights the weight of an input is analogous to the strength of a synapse in a biological system in biological systems learning occurs by strengthening or weakening the synaptic connections between nerve cells an artificial neural network simulates synaptic connection strength by increasing or decreasing the weight of input lines into neurons neural networks are trained with a series of data points the networks guess which response should be given and the guess is compared against the correct answer for each data point if errors occur the weights into the neurons are adjusted and the process repeats itself this learning approach is called backpropagation and is similar to statistical regression neural networks are used in a wide variety of business problems including optical character recognition financial forecasting market demographics trend assessment and various robotics applications propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent22 induction algorithms induction algorithms form another approach to machine learning in contrast to neural networks which are highly mathematical in nature induction approaches tend to involve symbolic data as the name implies these algorithms work by implementing inductive reasoning approaches induction is a reasoning method that can be characterized as “learning by example” unlike rulebased deduction induction begins with a set of observations and constructs rules to account for these observations inductive reasoning attempts to find general patterns that can fully explain the observations the system is presented with a large set of data consisting of several input variables and one decision variable the system constructs a decision tree by recursively partitioning data sets based on the variables that best distinguish between the data elements that is it attempts to partition the data so that each partition contains data with the same value for a decision variable it does this by selecting the input variables that do the best job of dividing the data set into homogeneous partitions for example consider figure 2 which contains the data set pertaining to decisions that were made on credit loan applications an induction algorithm would infer the rules in figure 3 to explain this data as this example illustrates an induction algorithm is able to induce rules that identify the general patterns in data in doing so these algorithms can prune out irrelevant or unnecessary attributes in the example above salary was irrelevant in terms of explaining the loan decision of the data set induction algorithms are often used for data mining applications such as marketing problems that help companies decide on the best market strategies for new product lines data mining is a common service included in data warehouses which are frequently used as decision support tools genetic algorithms genetic algorithms use an evolutionary approach to solve optimization problems these are based on darwins theory of evolution and in particular the notion of survival of the fittest concepts such as reproduction natural selection mutation chromosome and gene are all included in the genetic algorithm approach genetic algorithms are useful in optimization problems that must select from a very large number of possible solutions to a problem a classic example of this is the traveling salesperson problem consider a salesman who must visit n cities the salespersons problem is to find the shortest route by which to visit each of these n cities exactly once so that the salesman will tour all the cities figure 2 artificial intelligence expert systems salary credit history current assets loan decision a high poor

the origin for such a problem there are n – 1 possible solutions or n – 1 factorial for six cities this would mean 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 120 possible solutions suppose that the salesman must travel to 100 cities this would involve 99 possible solutions an astronomically high number obviously for this type of problem a brute strength method of exhaustively comparing all possible solutions figure 3 if the credit history is good then accept the loan application if the credit history is poor and current assets are high then accept the loan application if the credit history is poor and current assets are low then reject the loan application will not work this requires the use of heuristic methods of which the genetic algorithm is a prime example for the traveling salesperson problem a chromosome would be one possible route through the cities and a gene would be a city in a particular sequence on the chromosome the genetic algorithm would start with an initial population of chromosomes routes and measure each according to a fitness function the total distance traveled in the route those with the best fitness functions would be selected and those with the worst would be discarded then random pairs of surviving chromosomes would mate a process called crossover this involves swapping city positions between the pair of chromosomes resulting in a pair of child chromosomes in addition some random subset of the population would be mutated such that some portion of the sequence of cities would be altered the process of selection crossover and mutation results in a new population for the next generation this procedure is repeated through as many generations as necessary in order to obtain an optimal solution genetic algorithms are very effective at finding good solutions to optimization problems scheduling configuration and routing problems are good candidates for a genetic algorithm approach although genetic algorithms do not guarantee the absolute best solution they do

agents that are responsible for one or more aspects of the supply chain these agents interact with one another in the planning and execution of their tasks for instance a logistics agent is

ai machine learning systems creates new knowledge by finding previously unknown patterns in data in contrast to knowledge representation approaches which model the problemsolving structure of human experts machine learning systems derive solutions by “learning” patterns in data with little or no intervention by an expert there are three main machine learning techniques neural networks induction algorithms and genetic algorithmsneural networks neural networks simulate the human nervous system the concepts that guide neural network research and practice stem from studies of biological systems these systems model the interaction between nerve cells components of a neural network include neurons sometimes called “processing elements” input lines to the neurons called dendrites and output lines from the neurons called axonsneural networks are composed of richly connected sets of neurons forming layers the neural network architecture consists of an input layer which inputs data to the network an output layer which produces the resulting guess of the network and a series of one or more hidden layers which assist in propagating this is illustrated in figure 1during processing each neuron performs a weighted sum of inputs from the neurons connecting to it this is called activation the neuron chooses to fire if the sum of inputs exceeds some previously set threshold value this is called transferinputs with high weights tend to give greater activation to a neuron than inputs with low weights the weight of an input is analogous to the strength of a synapse in a biological system in biological systems learning occurs by strengthening or weakening the synaptic connections between nerve cells an artificial neural network simulates synaptic connection strength by increasing or decreasing the weight of input lines into neuronsneural networks are trained with a series of data points the networks guess which response should be given and the guess is compared against the correct answer for each data point if errors occur the weights into the neurons are adjusted and the process repeats itself this learning approach is called backpropagation and is similar to statistical regressionneural networks are used in a wide variety of business problems including optical character recognition financial forecasting market demographics trend assessment and various robotics applicationspropertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent22 induction algorithms induction algorithms form another approach to machine learning in contrast to neural networks which are highly mathematical in nature induction approaches tend to involve symbolic data as the name implies these algorithms work by implementing inductive reasoning approaches induction is a reasoning method that can be characterized as “learning by example” unlike rulebased deduction induction begins with a set of observations and constructs rules to account for these observations

this process is deemed artificial because once it is programmed it occurs without human intervention ai is generally applied to the theory and practical application of a computers ability to think like humans do ai capability is designated as either strong ai or weak ai strong ai is a computer system that actively employs consciousness a machine that can truly reason and solve problems independently critics of ai systems argue that such a machine is unrealistic and even if it were possible a true artificially intelligent machine is unwantedpopular perceptions of ai have been dramatized in movies such as 2001 a space odyssey 1968 in which a starship computer named hal 9000 is capable of speech and facial recognition natural language processing interpreting emotions and expressing reason another famous makebelieve computer was the star of wargames 1983 in this movie the line do you want to play a game allows the teenage hero to persuade the computer to play a game rather than start world war iii in both examples the computers undertook independent actions that were potentially harmful to their human creators this is the reason most often given for not creating strong ai machinespropertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent13 modern working applications of ai are examples of weak ai current ai research focuses on developing computers that use intelligent programming to automate routine human tasks for example many customer service telephone banks are automated by ai when a recorded voice asks for a yes or no response or for the caller to choose a menu item by saying specific words the computer on the other end of the telephone is using weak ai to make a decision and select the appropriate response based on caller input these computers are trained to recognize speech patterns dialects accents and replacement words such as oh—rather than zero—for the number 0 long before the development of computers the notion that thinking was a form of computation motivated the formalization of logic as a type of rational thought these efforts continue today graph theory provided the architecture for searching a solution space for a problem operations research with its focus on optimization algorithms uses graph theory to solve complex decisionmaking problems pioneers of ai ai uses syllogistic logic which was first postulated by aristotle this logic is based on deductive reasoning for example if a equals b and b equals c then a must also equal c throughout history the nature of syllogistic logic and deductive reasoning was shaped by grammarians mathematicians and philosophers when computers were developed programming languages used similar logical patterns to support software applications terms such as cybernetics and robotics were used to describe collective intelligence approaches and led to the development of ai as an experimental field in the 1950s propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent23

regarded as a form of computation—one that can be formalized and ultimately mechanized to achieve this however two major issues need to be addressed the first issue is knowledge representation and the second is knowledge manipulation within the intersection of these two issues lies mechanized intelligencethe study of artificial intelligence has a long history dating back to the work of british mathematician charles babbage 1791–1871 who developed a specialpurpose difference engine for mechanically computing the values of certain polynomial functions similar work was also done by german mathematician gottfried wilhem von leibniz 1646–1716 who introduced the first system of formal logic and constructed machines for automating calculation george boole ada byron king countess of lovelace gottlob frege and alfred tarski have all significantly contributed to the advancement of the field of artificial intelligencepropertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent14 it has long been recognized that the language and models used to represent reality profoundly impact ones understanding of reality itself when humans think about a particular system they form a mental model of that system and then proceed to discover truths about the system these truths lead to the ability to make predictions or general statements about the system however when a model does not sufficiently match the actual problem the discovery of truths and the ability to make predictions becomes exceedingly difficult a classic example of this is the precopernican model in which the sun and planets revolved around the earth in such a model it was prohibitively difficult to predict the position of planets however in the copernican revolution this earthcentric model was replaced with a model where the earth and other planets revolved around the sun this new model dramatically increased the ability of astronomers to predict celestial events arithmetic with roman numerals provides a second example of how knowledge representation can severely limit the ability to manipulate that knowledge both of these examples stress the important relationship between knowledge representation and thought in ai a significant effort has gone into the development of languages that can be used to represent knowledge appropriately languages such as lisp which is based on the lambda calculus and prolog which is based on formal logic are widely used for knowledge representation variations of predicate calculus are also common languages used by automated reasoning systems these languages have welldefined semantics and provide a very general framework for representing and manipulating knowledge knowledge manipulation propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent24 many problems that humans are confronted with are not fully understood this partial understanding is reflected in the fact that a rigid algorithmic solution—a routine and predetermined number of computational steps— cannot be applied rather the concept of search is used to solve such problems when search is used to explore the entire solution space it is said to be exhaustive exhaustive search is not typically a successful approach to problem solving because most interesting problems have search spaces that are simply too large to be dealt with in this manner even by the fastest computers therefore if one hopes to find a solution or a reasonably good approximation of a solution to such a problem one must selectively explore the problems search space the difficulty here is that if part of the search space is not explored one runs the risk that the solution one seeks will be missed thus in order to ignore a portion of a search space some guiding knowledge or insight must exist so that the solution will not be overlooked heuristics is a major area of ai that concerns itself with how to limit effectively the exploration of a search space chess is a classic example where humans routinely employ sophisticated heuristics in a search space a chess player will typically search through a small number of possible moves before selecting a move to play not every possible move and countermove sequence is explored only reasonable sequences are examined a large part of the intelligence of chess players resides in the heuristics they employ a heuristicbased search results from the application of domain or problemspecific knowledge to a universal search function the success of heuristics has led to focusing the application of general ai techniques to specific problem domains

artificial intelligence a modern approach englewood cliffs nj prentice hall 1994it has long been recognized that the language and models used to represent reality profoundly impact ones understanding of reality itself when humans think about a particular system they form a mental model of that system and then proceed to discover truths about the system these truths lead to the ability to make predictions or general statements about the system however when a model does not sufficiently match the actual problem the discovery of truths and the ability to make predictions becomes exceedingly difficulta classic example of this is the precopernican model in which the sun and planets revolved around the earth in such a model it was prohibitively difficult to predict the position of planets however in the copernican revolution this earthcentric model was replaced with a model where the earth and other planets revolved around the sun this new model dramatically increased the ability of astronomers to predict celestial eventsarithmetic with roman numerals provides a second example of how knowledge representation can severely limit the ability to manipulate that knowledge both of these examples stress the important relationship between knowledge representation and thoughtin ai a significant effort has gone into the development of languages that can be used to represent knowledge appropriately languages such as lisp which is based on the lambda calculus and prolog which is based on formal logic are widely used for knowledge representation variations of predicate calculus are also common languages used by automated reasoning systems these languages have welldefined semantics and provide a very general framework for representing and manipulating knowledgepropertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent24 many problems that humans are confronted with are not fully understood this partial understanding is reflected in the fact that a rigid algorithmic solution—a routine and predetermined number of computational steps— cannot be applied rather the concept of search is used to solve such problems when search is used to explore the

that imitates human learning and reasoning computers can outperform people when it comes to storing information solving numerical problems and doing repetitive tasks computer programmers originally designed software that accomplished these tasks by completing algorithms or clearly defined sets of instructions in contrast programmers design ai software to give the computer only the problem not the steps necessary to solve itall ai programs are built on two foundations a knowledge base and an inferencing capability inferencing means to draw a conclusion based on facts and prior knowledge a knowledge base is made up of many different pieces of information facts concepts theories procedures and relationships where conventional computer software must follow a strictly logical series of steps to reach a conclusion algorithm ai software uses the techniques of search and pattern matching the computer is given some initial information and then searches the knowledge base for specific conditions or patterns that fit the problem to be solved this special ability of ai programs—to reach a solution based on facts rather than on a preset series of steps—is what most closely resembles the thinking function of the human brain in addition to problem solving ai has many applications including expert systems natural language processing and roboticspropertagcmdpushfunction

study of artificial intelligence referred to as ai has accelerated in recent years as advancements in computer technology have made it possible to create more and more sophisticated machines and software programs the field of ai is dominated by computer scientists but it has important ramifications for psychologists as well because in creating machines that replicate human thought much is learned about the processes the human brain uses to thinkcreating a machine to think highlights the complexities and subtleties of the human mind for instance creating a machine to recognize objects in photographs would seem at first thought rather simple yet when humans look at a photograph they do so with expectations about the limitations of the media we fill in the missing third dimension and account for other missing or inconsistent images with our sense of what the real world looks like to program a computer to make those kinds of assumptions would be a gargantuan task consider for

behavioral aspects of human reasoning and learning research in ai is concentrated in some halfdozen areas in problem solving one must proceed from a beginning the initial state to the end the goal state via a limited number of steps ai here involves an attempt to model the reasoning process in solving a problem such as the proof of a theorem in euclidean geometry in game theory see games theory of the computer must choose among a number of possible next moves to select the one that optimizes its probability of winning this type of choice is analogous to that of a chess player selecting the next move in response to an opponents move in pattern recognition shapes forms or configurations of data must be identified and isolated from a larger group the process here is similar to that used by a doctor in classifying medical problems on the basis of symptoms natural language processing is an analysis of current or colloquial language usage without the sometimes misleading effect of formal grammars it is an attempt to model the learning process of a translator faced with the phrase throw mama from the train a kiss cybernetics is the analysis of the communication and control processes of biological organisms and their relationship to mechanical and electrical systems this study could ultimately lead to the development of thinking robots see robotics machine learning occurs when a computer improves its performance of a task on the basis of its programmed application of ai principles to its past performance of that taskin the public eye advances in chessplaying computer programs were symbolic of early progress in ai in 1948 british mathematician alan turing developed a chess algorithm for use with calculating machines—it lost to an amateur player in the one game that it played ten years later american mathematician claude shannon articulated two chessplaying algorithms brute force in which all possible moves and their consequences are calculated as far into the future as possible and selective mode in which only the most promising moves and their more immediate consequences are evaluatedin 1988 hitech a program developed at carnegiemellon univ defeated former us champion arnold denker in a fourgame match becoming the first computer to defeat a grandmaster a year later garry kasparov the reigning world champion bested deep thought a program developed by the ibm corp in a twogame exhibition in 1990 the german computer mephistoportrose became the first program to defeat a former world champion while playing an exhibition of 24 simultaneous games anatoly karpov bested 23 human opponents but lost to the computerkasparov in 1996 became the first reigning world champion to lose to a computer in a game played with regulation time controls the deep blue computer developed by the ibm corp won the first game of the match lost the second drew the third and fourth and lost the fifth and sixth deep blue used the brute force approach evaluating more than 100 billion chess positions each turn while looking six moves ahead it coupled this with the most efficient chess evaluation software yet developed and an extensive library of chess games it could analyze as part of the decision processsubsequent matches between vladimir kramnik and deep fritz 2002 2006 and kasparov and deep junior 2003 resulted in two ties and a win for the programs unlike deep blue which was a specially designed computer these more recent computer challengers were chess programs running on powerful personal computers such programs have become an important tool in chess and are used by chess masters to analyze games and experiment with new movesanother notable ibm ai computer watson competed in 2011 on the jeopardy television quiz show defeating two human champions watson about 100 times faster than deep blue was designed to process questions in natural human language as opposed to simple commands making sense of the quirky questions complexity and ambiguity and to search an extensive database to quickly provide the correct answers watson is a prototype for programs or services that can act as knowledgeable assistants or even human substitutes

sensing the world around it understanding conversations learning reasoning and reaching decisions just as would a human in 1950 the pioneering british mathematician alan turing proposed a test for artificial intelligence in which a human subject tries to talk with an unseen conversant the tester sends questions to the machine via teletype and reads its answers if the subject cannot discern whether the conversation is being held with another person or a machine then the machine is deemed to have artificial intelligence no machine has come close to passing this test and it is unlikely that one will in the near future researchers however have made progress on specific pieces of the artificial intelligence puzzle and some of their work has had tangible benefitsone area of progress is the field of expert systems or computer systems designed to reproduce the knowledge base and decisionmaking techniques used by experts in a given field such a system can train workers and assist in decision making mycin a program developed in 1976 at stanford university suggests possible diagnoses for patients with infectious blood diseases proposes treatments and explains its reasoning in

include seeing pathways picking things up learning categories from experience and using emotions to schedule ones actions—which many animals can do too thus human intelligence is not the sole focus of ai even terrestrial psychology is not the sole focus because some people use ai to explore the range of all possible mindsthere are four major ai methodologies symbolic ai connectionism situated robotics and evolutionary programming russell and norvig 2003 ai artifacts are correspondingly varied they include both programs including neural networks and robots each of which may be either designed in detail or largely evolved the field is closely related to artificial life alife which aims to throw light on biology much as some ai aims to throw light on psychologypropertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent113 ai researchers are inspired by two different intellectual motivations and while some people have both most favor one over the other on the one hand many ai researchers seek solutions to technological problems not caring whether these resemble human or animal psychology they often make use of ideas about how people do things programs designed to aidreplace human experts for example have been hugely influenced by knowledge engineering in which programmers try to discover what and how human experts are thinking when they do the tasks being modeled but if these technological ai workers can find a nonhuman method or even a mere trick a kludge to increase the power of their program they will gladly use it technological ai has been hugely successful it has entered administrative financial medical and manufacturing practice at countless different points it is largely invisible to the ordinary person lying behind some deceptively simple humancomputer interface or being hidden away inside a car or refrigerator many procedures taken for granted within current computer science were originated within ai patternrecognition and imageprocessing for example on the other hand ai researchers may have a scientific aim they may want their programs or robots to help people understand how human or animal minds work they may even ask how intelligence in general is possible exploring the space of possible minds the scientific approach—psychological ai—is the more relevant for philosophers boden 1990 copeland 1993 sloman 2002 it is also central to cognitive science and to computationalism considered as a whole psychological ai has been less obviously successful than technological ai this is partly because the tasks it tries to achieve are often more difficult in addition it is less clear—for philosophical as well as empirical reasons—what should be counted as success symbolic ai propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent213 symbolic ai is also known as classical ai and as gofai—short for john haugelands label good oldfashioned ai 1985 it models mental processes as the stepbystep information processing of digital computers thinking is seen as symbolmanipulation as formal computation over formal representations some gofai programs are explicitly hierarchical consisting of procedures and subroutines specified at different levels these define a hierarchically structured searchspace which may be astronomical in size rules of thumb or heuristics are typically provided to guide the search—by excluding certain areas of possibility and leading the program to focus on others the earliest ai programs were like this but the later methodology of objectoriented programming is similar certain symbolic programs namely production systems are implicitly hierarchical these consist of sets of logically separate ifthen conditionaction rules or productions defining what actions should be taken in response to specific conditions an action or condition may be unitary or complex in the latter case being defined by a conjunction of several miniactions or miniconditions and a production may function wholly within computer memory to set a goal for instance or to record a partial parsing or outside it via inputoutput devices such as cameras or keyboards another symbolic technique widely used in natural language processing nlp programs involves augmented transition networks or atns these avoid explicit backtracking by using guidance at each decisionpoint to decide which question to ask andor which path to take gofai methodology is used for developing a wide variety of languageusing programs and problemsolvers the more precisely and explicitly a problemdomain can be defined the more likely it is that a symbolic program can be used to good effect often folkpsychological categories andor specific propositions are explicitly represented in the system this type of ai and the forms of computational psychology based on it is defended by the philosopher jerry fodor 1988 propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent313 gofai models whether technological or scientific include robots planning programs theoremprovers learning programs questionanswerers datamining systems machine translators expert systems of many different kinds chess players semantic networks and analogy machines in addition a host of software agents—specialist miniprograms that can aid a human being to solve a problem—are implemented in this way and an increasingly important area of research is distributed ai in which cooperation occurs between many relatively simple individuals—which may be gofai agents or neuralnetwork units or situated robots the symbolic approach is used also in modeling creativity in various domains boden 2004 holland et al 1986 these include musical composition and expressive performance analogical thinking linedrawing painting architectural design storytelling rhetoric as well as plot mathematics and scientific discovery in general the relevant aesthetictheoretical style must be specified clearly so as to define a space of possibilities that can be fruitfully explored by the computer to what extent the exploratory procedures can plausibly be seen as similar to those used by people varies from case to case connectionist ai connectionist systems which became widely visible in the mid1980s are different they compute not by following stepbystep programs but by using large numbers of locally connected associative computational units each one of which is simple the processing is bottomup rather than topdown connectionism is sometimes said to be opposed to ai although it has been part of ai since its beginnings in the 1940s mcculloch and pitts 1943 pitts and mcculloch 1947 what connectionism is opposed to rather is symbolic ai yet even here opposed is not quite the right word since hybrid systems exist that combine both methodologies moreover gofai devotees such as fodor see connectionism as compatible with gofai claiming that it concerns how symbolic computation can be implemented fodor and pylyshyn 1988 propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent413 two largely separate ai communities began to emerge in the late 1950s boden forthcoming the symbolic school focused on logic and turingcomputation whereas the connectionist school focused on associative and often probabilistic neural networks most connectionist systems are connectionist virtual machines implemented in von neumann computers only a few are built in dedicated connectionist hardware many people remained sympathetic to both schools but the two methodologies are so different in practice that most handson ai researchers use either one or the other there are different types of connectionist systems most philosophical interest however has focused on networks that do parallel distributed processing or pdp clark 1989 rumelhart and mcclelland 1986 in essence pdp systems are pattern recognizers unlike brittle gofai programs which often produce nonsense if provided with incomplete or partcontradictory information they show graceful degradation that is the input patterns can be recognized up to a point even if they are imperfect a pdp network is made up of subsymbolic units whose semantic significance cannot easily be expressed in terms of familiar semantic content still less propositions some gofai programs employ subsymbolic units but most do not that is no single unit codes for a recognizable concept such as dog or cat these concepts are represented rather by the pattern of activity distributed over the entire network propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent513 because the representation is not stored in a single unit but is distributed over the whole network pdp systems can tolerate imperfect data some gofai systems can do so too but only if the imperfections are specifically foreseen and provided for by the programmer moreover a single subsymbolic unit may mean one thing in one inputcontext and another in another what the network as a whole can represent depends on what significance the designer has decided to assign to the inputunits for instance some inputunits are sensitive to light or to coded information about light others to sound others to triads of phonological categories … and so on most pdp systems can learn in such cases the weights on the links of pdp units in the hidden layer between the inputlayer and the outputlayer can be altered by experience so that the network can learn a pattern merely by being shown many examples of it a gofai learningprogram in effect has to be told what to look for beforehand and how broadly the weight on an excitatory link is increased by every coactivation of the two units concerned cells that fire together wire together these two ai approaches have complementary strengths and weaknesses for instance symbolic ai is better at modeling hierarchy and strong constraints whereas connectionism copes better with pattern recognition especially if many conflicting—and perhaps incomplete—constraints are relevant despite having fervent philosophical champions on both sides neither methodology is adequate for all of the tasks dealt with by ai scientists indeed much research in connectionism has aimed to restore the lost logical strengths of gofai to neural networks—with only limited success by the beginning of the twentyfirst century situated robotics propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent613 another and more recently popular ai methodology is situated robotics brooks 1991 like connectionism this was first explored in the 1950s situated robots are described by their designers as autonomous systems embedded in their environment heidegger is sometimes cited instead of planning their actions as classical robots do situated robots react directly to environmental cues one might say that they are embodied production systems whose ifthen rules are engineered rather than programmed and whose conditions lie in the external environment not inside computer memory although—unlike gofai robots—they contain no objective representations of the world some of them do construct temporary subjectcentered deictic representations the main aim of situated roboticists in the mid1980s such as rodney brooks was to solveavoid the frame problem that had bedeviled gofai pylyshyn 1987 gofai planners and robots had to anticipate all possible contingencies including the side effects of actions taken by the system itself if they were not to be defeated by unexpected—perhaps seemingly irrelevant—events this was one of the reasons given by hubert dreyfus 1992 in arguing that gofai could not possibly succeed intelligence he said is unformalizable several ways of implementing nonmonotonic logics in gofai were suggested allowing a conclusion previously drawn by faultless reasoning to be negated by new evidence but because the general nature of that new evidence had to be foreseen the frame problem persisted brooks argued that reasoning shouldnt be employed at all the system should simply react appropriately in a reflex fashion to specific environmental cues this he said is what insects do—and they are highly successful creatures soon situated robotics was being used for instance to model the sixlegged movement of cockroaches some people joked that ai stood for artificial insects not artificial intelligence but the joke carried a sting many argued that much human thinking needs objective representations so the scope for situated robotics was strictly limited evolutionary programming in evolutionary programming genetic algorithms gas are used by a program to make random variations in its own rules the initial rules before evolution begins either do not achieve the task in question or do so only inefficiently sometimes they are even chosen at random propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent713 the variations allowed are broadly modeled on biological mutations and crossovers although more unnatural types are sometimes employed the most successful rules are automatically selected and then varied again this is more easily said than done the breakthrough in ga methodology occurred when john holland 1992 defined an automatic procedure for recognizing which rules out of a large and simultaneously active set were those most responsible for whatever level of success the evolving system had just achieved selection is done by some specific fitness criterion predefined in light of the task the programmer has in mind unlike gofai systems a ga program contains no explicit representation of what it is required to do its task is implicit in the fitness criterion similarly living things have evolved to do what they do without knowing what that is after many generations the ga system may be welladapted to its task for certain types of tasks it can even find the optimal solution this ai method is used to develop both symbolic and connectionist ai systems and it is applied both to abstract problemsolving mathematical optimization for instance or the synthesis of new pharmaceutical molecules and to evolutionary robotics—wherein the brain andor sensorimotor anatomy of robots evolve within a specific taskenvironment it is also used for artistic purposes in the composition of music or the generation of new visual forms in these cases evolution is usually interactive that is the variation is done automatically but the selection is done by a human being—who does not need to and usually could not define or even name the aesthetic fitness criteria being applied artificial life ai is a close cousin of alife boden 1996 this is a form of mathematical biology which employs computer simulation and situated robotics to study the emergence of complexity in selforganizing selfreproducing adaptive systems a caveat much as some ai is purely technological in aim so is some alife the research of most interest to philosophers is the scientifically oriented type the key concepts of alife date back to the early 1950s they originated in theoretical work on selforganizing systems of various kinds including diffusion equations and cellular automata by alan turing and john von neumann respectively and in early selfequilibrating machines and situated robots built by w ross ashby and w grey walter but alife did not flourish until the late 1980s when computing power at last sufficed to explore these theoretical ideas in practice much alife work focuses on specific biological phenomena such as flocking cooperation in ant colonies or morphogenesis—from celldifferentiation to the formation of leopard spots or tiger stripes but alife also studies general principles of selforganization in biology evolution and coevolution reproduction and metabolism in addition it explores the nature of life as such—life as it could be not merely life as it is alife workers do not all use the same methodology but they do eschew the topdown methods of gofai situated and evolutionary robotics and gagenerated neural networks too are prominent approaches within the field but not all alife systems are evolutionary some demonstrate how a small number of fixed and simple rules can lead to selforganization of an apparently complex kind many alifers take pains to distance themselves from ai but besides their close historical connections ai and alife are philosophically related in virtue of the linkage between life and mind it is known that psychological properties arise in living things and some people argue or assume that they can arise only in living things accordingly the whole of ai could be regarded as a subarea of alife indeed some people argue that success in ai even in technological ai must await and build on success in alife why ai is a misleading label whichever of the two ai motivations—technological or psychological—is in question the name of the field is misleading in three ways first the term intelligence is normally understood to cover only a subset of what ai workers are trying to do second intelligence is often supposed to be distinct from emotion so that ai is assumed to exclude work on that and third the name implies that a successful ai system would really be intelligent—a philosophically controversial claim that ai researchers do not have to endorse though some do as for the first point people do not normally regard vision or locomotion as examples of intelligence many people would say that speaking ones native language is not a case of intelligence either except in comparison with nonhuman species and common sense is sometimes contrasted with intelligence the term is usually reserved for special cases of human thought that show exceptional creativity and subtlety or which require many years of formal education medical diagnosis scientific or legal reasoning playing chess and translating from one language to another are typically regarded as difficult thus requiring intelligence and these tasks were the main focus of research when ai began vision for example was assumed to be relatively straightforward—not least because many nonhuman animals have it too it gradually became clear however that everyday capacities such as vision and locomotion are vastly more complex than had been supposed the early definition of ai as programming computers to do things that involve intelligence when done by people was recognized as misleading and eventually dropped similarly intelligence is often opposed to emotion many people assume that ai could never model that however crude examples of such models existed in the early 1960s and emotion was recognized by a high priest of ai herbert simon as being essential to any complex intelligence later research in the computational philosophy and modeling of affect showed that emotions have evolved as scheduling mechanisms for systems with many different and potentially conflicting purposes minsky 1985 and web site when ai began it was difficult enough to get a program to follow one goal with its subgoals intelligently—any more than that was essentially impossible for this reason among others ai modeling of emotion was put on the back burner for about thirty years by the 1990s however it had become a popular focus of ai research and of neuroscience and philosophy too the third point raises the difficult question—which many ai practitioners leave open or even ignore—of whether intentionality can properly be ascribed to any conceivable programrobot newell 1980 dennett 1987 harnad 1991 ai and intentionality could some nlp programs really understand the sentences they parse and the words they translate or can a visuomotor circuit evolved within a robots neuralnetwork brain truly be said to represent the environmental feature to which it responds if a program in practice could pass the turing test could it truly be said to think more generally does it even make sense to say that ai may one day achieve artificially produced but nonetheless genuine intelligence for the many people in the field who adopt some form of functionalism the answer in each case is in principle yes this applies for those who favor the physical symbol system hypothesis or intentional systems theory others adopt connectionist analyses of concepts and of their development from nonconceptual content functionalism is criticized by many writers expert in neuroscience who claim that its core thesis of multiple realizability is mistaken others criticize it at an even deeper level a growing minority especially in alife reject neocartesian approaches in favor of philosophies of embodiment such as phenomenology or autopoiesis part of the reason why such questions are so difficult is that philosophers disagree about what intentionality is even in the human case practitioners of psychological ai generally believe that semantic content or intentionality can be naturalized but they differ about how this can be done for instance a few practitioners of ai regard computation and intentionality as metaphysically inseparable smith 1996 others ascribe meaning only to computations with certain causal consequences and provenance or grounding john searle argues that ai cannot capture intentionality because—at base—it is concerned with the formal manipulation of formal symbols and for those who accept some form of evolutionary semantics only evolutionary robots could embody meaning searle 1980 see also computationalism machine

good oldfashioned ai 1985 it models mental processes as the stepbystep information processing of digital computers thinking is seen as symbolmanipulation as formal computation over formal representations some gofai programs are explicitly hierarchical consisting of procedures and subroutines specified at different levels these define a hierarchically structured searchspace which may be astronomical in size rules of thumb or heuristics are typically provided to guide the search—by excluding certain areas of possibility and leading the program to focus on others the earliest ai programs were like this but the later methodology of objectoriented programming is similar certain symbolic programs namely production systems are implicitly hierarchical these consist of sets of logically separate ifthen conditionaction rules or productions defining what actions should be taken in response to specific conditions an action or condition may be unitary or complex in the latter case being defined by a conjunction of several miniactions or miniconditions and a production may function wholly within computer memory to set a goal for instance or to record a partial parsing or outside it via inputoutput devices such as cameras or keyboards another symbolic technique widely used in natural language processing nlp programs involves augmented transition networks or atns these avoid explicit backtracking by using guidance at each decisionpoint to decide which question to ask andor which path to take gofai methodology is used for developing a wide variety of languageusing programs and problemsolvers the more precisely and explicitly a problemdomain can be defined the more likely it is that a symbolic program can be used to good effect often folkpsychological categories andor specific propositions are explicitly represented in the system this type of ai and the forms of computational psychology based on it is defended by the philosopher jerry fodor 1988

datamining systems machine translators expert systems of many different kinds chess players semantic networks and analogy machines in addition a host of software agents—specialist miniprograms that can aid a human being to solve a problem—are implemented in this way and an increasingly important area of research is distributed ai in which cooperation occurs between many relatively simple individuals—which may be gofai agents or neuralnetwork units or situated robots the symbolic approach is used also in modeling creativity in various domains boden 2004 holland et al 1986 these include musical composition and expressive performance analogical thinking linedrawing painting architectural design storytelling rhetoric as well as plot mathematics and scientific discovery in general the relevant aesthetictheoretical style must be specified clearly so as to define a space of possibilities that can be fruitfully explored by the computer to what extent the exploratory procedures can plausibly be seen as similar to those used by people varies from case to case connectionist ai connectionist systems which became widely visible in the mid1980s are different they compute not by following stepbystep programs but by using large numbers of locally connected associative computational units each one of which is simple the processing is bottomup rather than topdown connectionism is sometimes said to be opposed to ai although it has been part of ai since its beginnings in the 1940s mcculloch and pitts 1943 pitts and mcculloch 1947 what connectionism is opposed to rather is symbolic ai yet even here opposed is not quite the right word since hybrid systems exist that combine both methodologies moreover gofai devotees such as fodor see connectionism as compatible with gofai claiming that it concerns how symbolic computation can be implemented fodor and pylyshyn 1988 propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent413 two largely separate ai communities began to emerge in the late 1950s boden forthcoming the symbolic school focused on logic and turingcomputation whereas the connectionist school focused on associative and often probabilistic neural networks most connectionist systems are connectionist virtual machines implemented in von neumann computers only a few are built in dedicated connectionist hardware many people remained sympathetic to both schools but the two methodologies are so different in practice that most handson ai researchers use either one or the other there are different types of connectionist systems most philosophical interest however has focused on networks that do parallel distributed processing or pdp clark 1989 rumelhart and mcclelland 1986 in essence pdp systems are pattern recognizers unlike brittle gofai programs which often produce nonsense if provided with incomplete or partcontradictory information they show graceful degradation that is the input patterns can be recognized up to a point even if they are imperfect a pdp network is made up of subsymbolic units whose semantic significance cannot easily be expressed in terms of familiar semantic content still less propositions some gofai programs employ subsymbolic units but most do not that is no single unit codes for a recognizable concept such as dog or cat these concepts are represented rather by the pattern of activity distributed over the entire network propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent513 because the representation is not stored in a single unit but is distributed over the whole network pdp systems can tolerate imperfect data some gofai systems can do so too but only if the imperfections are specifically foreseen and provided for by the programmer moreover a single subsymbolic unit may mean one thing in one inputcontext and another in another what the network as a whole can represent depends on what significance the designer has decided to assign to the inputunits for instance some inputunits are sensitive to light or to coded information about light others to sound others to triads of phonological categories … and so on most pdp systems can learn in such cases the weights on the links of pdp units in the hidden layer between the inputlayer and the outputlayer can be altered by experience so that the network can learn a pattern merely by being shown many examples of it a gofai learningprogram in effect has to be told what to look for beforehand and how broadly the weight on an excitatory link is increased by every coactivation of the two units concerned cells that fire together wire together these two ai approaches have complementary strengths and weaknesses for instance symbolic ai is better at modeling hierarchy and strong constraints whereas connectionism copes better with pattern recognition especially if many conflicting—and perhaps incomplete—constraints are relevant despite having fervent philosophical champions on both sides neither methodology is adequate for all of the tasks dealt with by ai scientists indeed much research in connectionism has aimed to restore the lost logical strengths of gofai to neural networks—with only limited success by the beginning of the twentyfirst century situated robotics propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent613 another and more recently popular ai methodology is situated robotics brooks 1991 like connectionism this was first explored in the 1950s situated robots are described by their designers as autonomous systems embedded in their environment heidegger is sometimes cited instead of planning their actions as classical robots do situated robots react directly to environmental cues one might say that they are embodied production systems whose ifthen rules are engineered rather than programmed and whose conditions lie in the external environment not inside computer memory although—unlike gofai robots—they contain no objective representations of the world some of them do construct temporary subjectcentered deictic representations the main aim of situated roboticists in the mid1980s such as rodney brooks was to solveavoid the frame problem that had bedeviled gofai pylyshyn 1987 gofai planners and robots had to anticipate all possible contingencies including the side effects of actions taken by the system itself if they were not to be defeated by unexpected—perhaps seemingly irrelevant—events this was one of the reasons given by hubert dreyfus 1992 in arguing that gofai could not possibly succeed intelligence he said is unformalizable several ways of implementing nonmonotonic logics in gofai were suggested allowing a conclusion previously drawn by faultless reasoning to be negated by new evidence but because the general nature of that new evidence had to be foreseen the frame problem persisted brooks argued that reasoning shouldnt be employed at all the system should simply react appropriately in a reflex fashion to specific environmental cues this he said is what insects do—and they are highly successful creatures soon situated robotics was being used for instance to model the sixlegged movement of cockroaches some people joked that ai stood for artificial insects not artificial intelligence but the joke carried a sting many argued that much human thinking needs objective representations so the scope for situated robotics was strictly limited evolutionary programming in evolutionary programming genetic algorithms gas are used by a program to make random variations in its own rules the initial rules before evolution begins either do not achieve the task in question or do so only inefficiently sometimes they are even chosen at random propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent713 the variations allowed are broadly modeled on biological mutations and crossovers although more unnatural types are sometimes employed the most successful rules are automatically selected and then varied again this is more easily said than done the breakthrough in ga methodology occurred when john holland 1992 defined an automatic procedure for recognizing which rules out of a large and simultaneously active set were those most responsible for whatever level of success the evolving system had just achieved selection is done by some specific fitness criterion predefined in light of the task the programmer has in mind unlike gofai systems a ga program contains no explicit representation of what it is required to do its task is implicit in the fitness criterion similarly living things have evolved to do what they do without knowing what that is after many generations the ga system may be welladapted to its task for certain types of tasks it can even find the optimal solution this ai method is used to develop both symbolic and connectionist ai systems and it is applied both to abstract problemsolving mathematical optimization for instance or the synthesis of new pharmaceutical molecules and to evolutionary robotics—wherein the brain andor sensorimotor anatomy of robots evolve within a specific taskenvironment it is also used for artistic purposes in the composition of music or the generation of new visual forms in these cases evolution is usually interactive that is the variation is done automatically but the selection is done by a human being—who does not need to and usually could not define or even name the aesthetic fitness criteria being applied artificial life ai is a close cousin of alife boden 1996 this is a form of mathematical biology which employs computer simulation and situated robotics to study the emergence of complexity in selforganizing selfreproducing adaptive systems a caveat much as some ai is purely technological in aim so is some alife the research of most interest to philosophers is the scientifically oriented type the key concepts of alife date back to the early 1950s they originated in theoretical work on selforganizing systems of various kinds including diffusion equations and cellular automata by alan turing and john von neumann respectively and in early selfequilibrating machines and situated robots built by w ross ashby and w grey walter but alife did not flourish until the late 1980s when computing power at last sufficed to explore these theoretical ideas in practice much alife work focuses on specific biological phenomena such as flocking cooperation in ant colonies or morphogenesis—from celldifferentiation to the formation of leopard spots or tiger stripes but alife also studies general principles of selforganization in biology evolution and coevolution reproduction and metabolism in addition it explores the nature of life as such—life as it could be not merely life as it is alife workers do not all use the same methodology but they do eschew the topdown methods of gofai situated and evolutionary robotics and gagenerated neural networks too are prominent approaches within the field but not all alife systems are evolutionary some demonstrate how a small number of fixed and simple rules can lead to selforganization of an apparently complex kind many alifers take pains to distance themselves from ai but besides their close historical connections ai and alife are philosophically related in virtue of the linkage between life and mind it is known that psychological properties arise in living things and some people argue or assume that they can arise only in living things accordingly the whole of ai could be regarded as a subarea of alife indeed some people argue that success in ai even in technological ai must await and build on success in alife why ai is a misleading label whichever of the two ai motivations—technological or psychological—is in question the name of the field is misleading in three ways first the term intelligence is normally understood to cover only a subset of what ai workers are trying to do second intelligence is often supposed to be distinct from emotion so that ai is assumed to exclude work on that and third the name implies that a successful ai system would really be intelligent—a philosophically controversial claim that ai researchers do not have to endorse though some do as for the first point people do not normally regard vision or locomotion as examples of intelligence many people would say that speaking ones native language is not a case of intelligence either except in comparison with nonhuman species and common sense is sometimes contrasted with intelligence the term is usually reserved for special cases of human thought that show exceptional creativity and subtlety or which require many years of formal education medical diagnosis scientific or legal reasoning playing chess and translating from one language to another are typically regarded as difficult thus requiring intelligence and these tasks were the main focus of research when ai began vision for example was assumed to be relatively straightforward—not least because many nonhuman animals have it too it gradually became clear however that everyday capacities such as vision and locomotion are vastly more complex than had been supposed the early definition of ai as programming computers to do things that involve intelligence when done by people was recognized as misleading and eventually dropped similarly intelligence is often opposed to emotion many people assume that ai could never model that however crude examples of such models existed in the early 1960s and emotion was recognized by a high priest of ai herbert simon as being essential to any complex intelligence later research in the computational philosophy and modeling of affect showed that emotions have evolved as scheduling mechanisms for systems with many different and potentially conflicting purposes minsky 1985 and web site when ai began it was difficult enough to get a program to follow one goal with its subgoals intelligently—any more than that was essentially impossible for this reason among others ai modeling of emotion was put on the back burner for about thirty years by the 1990s however it had become a popular focus of ai research and of neuroscience and philosophy too the third point raises the difficult question—which many ai practitioners leave open or even ignore—of whether intentionality can properly be ascribed to any conceivable programrobot newell 1980 dennett 1987 harnad 1991 ai and intentionality could some nlp programs really understand the sentences they parse and the words they translate or can a visuomotor circuit evolved within a robots neuralnetwork brain truly be said to represent the environmental feature to which it responds if a program in practice could pass the turing test could it truly be said to think more generally does it even make sense to say that ai may one day achieve artificially produced but nonetheless genuine intelligence for the many people in the field who adopt some form of functionalism the answer in each case is in principle yes this applies for those who favor the physical symbol system hypothesis or intentional systems theory others adopt connectionist analyses of concepts and of their development from nonconceptual content functionalism is criticized by many writers expert in neuroscience who claim that its core thesis of multiple realizability is mistaken others criticize it at an even deeper level a growing minority especially in alife reject neocartesian approaches in favor of philosophies of embodiment such as phenomenology or autopoiesis part of the reason why such questions are so difficult is that philosophers disagree about what intentionality is even in the human case practitioners of psychological ai generally believe that semantic content or intentionality can be naturalized but they differ about how this can be done for instance a few practitioners of ai regard computation and intentionality as metaphysically inseparable smith 1996 others ascribe meaning only to computations with certain causal consequences and provenance or grounding john searle argues that ai cannot capture intentionality because—at base—it is concerned with the formal manipulation of formal symbols and for those who accept some form of evolutionary semantics only evolutionary robots could embody meaning searle 1980 see also computationalism machine

chess players semantic networks and analogy machines in addition a host of software agents—specialist miniprograms that can aid a human being to solve a problem—are implemented in this way and an

space of possibilities that can be fruitfully explored by the computer to what extent the exploratory procedures can plausibly be seen as similar to those used by people varies from case to caseconnectionist systems which became widely visible in the mid1980s are different they compute not by following stepbystep programs but by using large numbers of locally connected associative computational units each one of which is simple the processing is bottomup rather than topdownconnectionism is sometimes said to be opposed to ai although it has been part of ai since its beginnings in the 1940s mcculloch and pitts 1943 pitts and mcculloch 1947 what connectionism is opposed to rather is symbolic ai yet even here opposed is not quite the right word since hybrid systems exist that combine both methodologies moreover gofai devotees such as fodor see connectionism as compatible with gofai claiming that it concerns how symbolic computation can be implemented fodor and pylyshyn 1988propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent413 two largely separate ai communities began to emerge in the late 1950s boden forthcoming the symbolic school focused on logic and turingcomputation whereas the connectionist school focused on associative and often probabilistic neural networks most connectionist systems are connectionist virtual machines implemented in von neumann computers only a few are built in dedicated connectionist hardware many people remained sympathetic to both schools but the two methodologies are so different in practice that most handson ai researchers use either one or the other there are different types of connectionist systems most philosophical interest however has focused on networks that do parallel distributed processing or pdp clark 1989 rumelhart and mcclelland 1986 in essence pdp systems are pattern recognizers unlike brittle gofai programs which often produce nonsense if provided with incomplete or partcontradictory information they show graceful degradation that is the input patterns can be recognized up to a point even if they are imperfect a pdp network is made up of subsymbolic units whose semantic significance cannot easily be expressed in terms of familiar semantic content still less propositions some gofai programs employ subsymbolic units but most do not that is no single unit codes for a recognizable concept such as dog or cat these concepts are represented rather by the pattern of activity distributed over the entire network propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent513 because the representation is not stored in a single unit but is distributed over the whole network pdp systems can tolerate imperfect data some gofai systems can do so too but only if the imperfections are specifically foreseen and provided for by the programmer moreover a single subsymbolic unit may mean one thing in one inputcontext and another in another what the network as a whole can represent depends on what significance the designer has decided to assign to the inputunits for instance some inputunits are sensitive to light or to coded information about light others to sound others to triads of phonological categories … and so on most pdp systems can learn in such cases the weights on the links of pdp units in the hidden layer between the inputlayer and the outputlayer can be altered by experience so that the network can learn a pattern merely by being shown many examples of it a gofai learningprogram in effect has to be told what to look for beforehand and how broadly the weight on an excitatory link is increased by every coactivation of the two units concerned cells that fire together wire together these two ai approaches have complementary strengths and weaknesses for instance symbolic ai is better at modeling hierarchy and strong constraints whereas connectionism copes better with pattern recognition especially if many conflicting—and perhaps incomplete—constraints are relevant despite having fervent philosophical champions on both sides neither methodology is adequate for all of the tasks dealt with by ai scientists indeed much research in connectionism has aimed to restore the lost logical strengths of gofai to neural networks—with only limited success by the beginning of the twentyfirst century situated robotics propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent613 another and more recently popular ai methodology is situated robotics brooks 1991 like connectionism this was first explored in the 1950s situated robots are described by their designers as autonomous systems embedded in their environment heidegger is sometimes cited instead of planning their actions as classical robots do situated robots react directly to environmental cues one might say that they are embodied production systems whose ifthen rules are engineered rather than programmed and whose conditions lie in the external environment not inside computer memory although—unlike gofai robots—they contain no objective representations of the world some of them do construct temporary subjectcentered deictic representations the main aim of situated roboticists in the mid1980s such as rodney brooks was to solveavoid the frame problem that had bedeviled gofai pylyshyn 1987 gofai planners and robots had to anticipate all possible contingencies including the side effects of actions taken by the system itself if they were not to be defeated by unexpected—perhaps seemingly irrelevant—events this was one of the reasons given by hubert dreyfus 1992 in arguing that gofai could not possibly succeed intelligence he said is unformalizable several ways of implementing nonmonotonic logics in gofai were suggested allowing a conclusion previously drawn by faultless reasoning to be negated by new evidence but because the general nature of that new evidence had to be foreseen the frame problem persisted brooks argued that reasoning shouldnt be employed at all the system should simply react appropriately in a reflex fashion to specific environmental cues this he said is what insects do—and they are highly successful creatures soon situated robotics was being used for instance to model the sixlegged movement of cockroaches some people joked that ai stood for artificial insects not artificial intelligence but the joke carried a sting many argued that much human thinking needs objective representations so the scope for situated robotics was strictly limited evolutionary programming in evolutionary programming genetic algorithms gas are used by a program to make random variations in its own rules the initial rules before evolution begins either do not achieve the task in question or do so only inefficiently sometimes they are even chosen at random propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent713 the variations allowed are broadly modeled on biological mutations and crossovers although more unnatural types are sometimes employed the most successful rules are automatically selected and then varied again this is more easily said than done the breakthrough in ga methodology occurred when john holland 1992 defined an automatic procedure for recognizing which rules out of a large and simultaneously active set were those most responsible for whatever level of success the evolving system had just achieved selection is done by some specific fitness criterion predefined in light of the task the programmer has in mind unlike gofai systems a ga program contains no explicit representation of what it is required to do its task is implicit in the fitness criterion similarly living things have evolved to do what they do without knowing what that is after many generations the ga system may be welladapted to its task for certain types of tasks it can even find the optimal solution this ai method is used to develop both symbolic and connectionist ai systems and it is applied both to abstract problemsolving mathematical optimization for instance or the synthesis of new pharmaceutical molecules and to evolutionary robotics—wherein the brain andor sensorimotor anatomy of robots evolve within a specific taskenvironment it is also used for artistic purposes in the composition of music or the generation of new visual forms in these cases evolution is usually interactive that is the variation is done automatically but the selection is done by a human being—who does not need to and usually could not define or even name the aesthetic fitness criteria being applied artificial life ai is a close cousin of alife boden 1996 this is a form of mathematical biology which employs computer simulation and situated robotics to study the emergence of complexity in selforganizing selfreproducing adaptive systems a caveat much as some ai is purely technological in aim so is some alife the research of most interest to philosophers is the scientifically oriented type the key concepts of alife date back to the early 1950s they originated in theoretical work on selforganizing systems of various kinds including diffusion equations and cellular automata by alan turing and john von neumann respectively and in early selfequilibrating machines and situated robots built by w ross ashby and w grey walter but alife did not flourish until the late 1980s when computing power at last sufficed to explore these theoretical ideas in practice much alife work focuses on specific biological phenomena such as flocking cooperation in ant colonies or morphogenesis—from celldifferentiation to the formation of leopard spots or tiger stripes but alife also studies general principles of selforganization in biology evolution and coevolution reproduction and metabolism in addition it explores the nature of life as such—life as it could be not merely life as it is alife workers do not all use the same methodology but they do eschew the topdown methods of gofai situated and evolutionary robotics and gagenerated neural networks too are prominent approaches within the field but not all alife systems are evolutionary some demonstrate how a small number of fixed and simple rules can lead to selforganization of an apparently complex kind many alifers take pains to distance themselves from ai but besides their close historical connections ai and alife are philosophically related in virtue of the linkage between life and mind it is known that psychological properties arise in living things and some people argue or assume that they can arise only in living things accordingly the whole of ai could be regarded as a subarea of alife indeed some people argue that success in ai even in technological ai must await and build on success in alife why ai is a misleading label whichever of the two ai motivations—technological or psychological—is in question the name of the field is misleading in three ways first the term intelligence is normally understood to cover only a subset of what ai workers are trying to do second intelligence is often supposed to be distinct from emotion so that ai is assumed to exclude work on that and third the name implies that a successful ai system would really be intelligent—a philosophically controversial claim that ai researchers do not have to endorse though some do as for the first point people do not normally regard vision or locomotion as examples of intelligence many people would say that speaking ones native language is not a case of intelligence either except in comparison with nonhuman species and common sense is sometimes contrasted with intelligence the term is usually reserved for special cases of human thought that show exceptional creativity and subtlety or which require many years of formal education medical diagnosis scientific or legal reasoning playing chess and translating from one language to another are typically regarded as difficult thus requiring intelligence and these tasks were the main focus of research when ai began vision for example was assumed to be relatively straightforward—not least because many nonhuman animals have it too it gradually became clear however that everyday capacities such as vision and locomotion are vastly more complex than had been supposed the early definition of ai as programming computers to do things that involve intelligence when done by people was recognized as misleading and eventually dropped similarly intelligence is often opposed to emotion many people assume that ai could never model that however crude examples of such models existed in the early 1960s and emotion was recognized by a high priest of ai herbert simon as being essential to any complex intelligence later research in the computational philosophy and modeling of affect showed that emotions have evolved as scheduling mechanisms for systems with many different and potentially conflicting purposes minsky 1985 and web site when ai began it was difficult enough to get a program to follow one goal with its subgoals intelligently—any more than that was essentially impossible for this reason among others ai modeling of emotion was put on the back burner for about thirty years by the 1990s however it had become a popular focus of ai research and of neuroscience and philosophy too the third point raises the difficult question—which many ai practitioners leave open or even ignore—of whether intentionality can properly be ascribed to any conceivable programrobot newell 1980 dennett 1987 harnad 1991 ai and intentionality could some nlp programs really understand the sentences they parse and the words they translate or can a visuomotor circuit evolved within a robots neuralnetwork brain truly be said to represent the environmental feature to which it responds if a program in practice could pass the turing test could it truly be said to think more generally does it even make sense to say that ai may one day achieve artificially produced but nonetheless genuine intelligence for the many people in the field who adopt some form of functionalism the answer in each case is in principle yes this applies for those who favor the physical symbol system hypothesis or intentional systems theory others adopt connectionist analyses of concepts and of their development from nonconceptual content functionalism is criticized by many writers expert in neuroscience who claim that its core thesis of multiple realizability is mistaken others criticize it at an even deeper level a growing minority especially in alife reject neocartesian approaches in favor of philosophies of embodiment such as phenomenology or autopoiesis part of the reason why such questions are so difficult is that philosophers disagree about what intentionality is even in the human case practitioners of psychological ai generally believe that semantic content or intentionality can be naturalized but they differ about how this can be done for instance a few practitioners of ai regard computation and intentionality as metaphysically inseparable smith 1996 others ascribe meaning only to computations with certain causal consequences and provenance or grounding john searle argues that ai cannot capture intentionality because—at base—it is concerned with the formal manipulation of formal symbols and for those who accept some form of evolutionary semantics only evolutionary robots could embody meaning searle 1980 see also computationalism machine intelligence bibliography boden margaret a the creative

centurypropertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent613 another and more recently popular ai methodology is situated robotics brooks 1991 like connectionism this was first explored in the 1950s situated robots are described by their designers as autonomous systems embedded in their environment heidegger is sometimes cited instead of planning their actions as classical robots do situated robots react directly to environmental cues one might say that they are embodied production systems whose ifthen rules are engineered rather than programmed and whose conditions lie in the external environment not inside computer memory although—unlike gofai robots—they contain no objective representations of the world some of them do construct temporary subjectcentered deictic representations the main aim of situated roboticists in the mid1980s such as rodney brooks was to solveavoid the frame problem that had bedeviled gofai pylyshyn 1987 gofai planners and robots had to anticipate all possible contingencies including the side effects of actions taken by the system itself if they were not to be defeated by unexpected—perhaps seemingly irrelevant—events this was one of the reasons given by hubert dreyfus 1992 in arguing that gofai could not possibly succeed intelligence he said is unformalizable several ways of implementing nonmonotonic logics in gofai were suggested allowing a conclusion previously drawn by faultless reasoning to be negated by new evidence but because the general nature of that new evidence had to be foreseen the frame problem persisted brooks argued that reasoning shouldnt be employed at all the system should simply react appropriately in a reflex fashion to specific environmental cues this he said is what insects do—and they are highly successful creatures soon situated robotics was being used for instance to model the sixlegged movement of cockroaches some people joked that ai stood for artificial insects not artificial intelligence but the joke carried a sting many argued that much human thinking needs objective representations so the scope for situated robotics was strictly limited evolutionary programming in evolutionary programming genetic algorithms gas are used by a program to make random variations in its own rules the initial rules before evolution begins either do not achieve the task in question or do so only inefficiently sometimes they are even chosen at random propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent713 the variations allowed are broadly modeled on biological mutations and crossovers although more unnatural types are sometimes employed the most successful rules are automatically selected and then varied again this is more easily said than done the breakthrough in ga methodology occurred when john holland 1992 defined an automatic procedure for recognizing which rules out of a large and simultaneously active set were those most responsible for whatever level of success the evolving system had just achieved selection is done by some specific fitness criterion predefined in light of the task the programmer has in mind unlike gofai systems a ga program contains no explicit representation of what it is required to do its task is implicit in the fitness criterion similarly living things have evolved to do what they do without knowing what that is after many generations the ga system may be welladapted to its task for certain types of tasks it can even find the optimal solution this ai method is used to develop both symbolic and connectionist ai systems and it is applied both to abstract problemsolving mathematical optimization for instance or the synthesis of new pharmaceutical molecules and to evolutionary robotics—wherein the brain andor sensorimotor anatomy of robots evolve within a specific taskenvironment it is also used for artistic purposes in the composition of music or the generation of new visual forms in these cases evolution is usually interactive that is the variation is done automatically but the selection is done by a human being—who does not need to and usually could not define or even name the aesthetic fitness criteria being applied artificial life ai is a close cousin of alife boden 1996 this is a form of mathematical biology which employs computer simulation and situated robotics to study the emergence of complexity in selforganizing selfreproducing adaptive systems a caveat much as some ai is purely technological in aim so is some alife the research of most interest to philosophers is the scientifically oriented type the key concepts of alife date back to the early 1950s they originated in theoretical work on selforganizing systems of various kinds including diffusion equations and cellular automata by alan turing and john von neumann respectively and in early selfequilibrating machines and situated robots built by w ross ashby and w grey walter but alife did not flourish until the late 1980s when computing power at last sufficed to explore these theoretical ideas in practice much alife work focuses on specific biological phenomena such as flocking cooperation in ant colonies or morphogenesis—from celldifferentiation to the formation of leopard spots or tiger stripes but alife also studies general principles of selforganization in biology evolution and coevolution reproduction and metabolism in addition it explores the nature of life as such—life as it could be not merely life as it is alife workers do not all use the same methodology but they do eschew the topdown methods of gofai situated and evolutionary robotics and gagenerated neural networks too are prominent approaches within the field but not all alife systems are evolutionary some demonstrate how a small number of fixed and simple rules can lead to selforganization of an apparently complex kind many alifers take pains to distance themselves from ai but besides their close historical connections ai and alife are philosophically related in virtue of the linkage between life and mind it is known that psychological properties arise in living things and some people argue or assume that they can arise only in living things accordingly the whole of ai could be regarded as a subarea of alife indeed some people argue that success in ai even in technological ai must await and build on success in alife why ai is a misleading label whichever of the two ai motivations—technological or psychological—is in question the name of the field is misleading in three ways first the term intelligence is normally understood to cover only a subset of what ai workers are trying to do second intelligence is often supposed to be distinct from emotion so that ai is assumed to exclude work on that and third the name implies that a successful ai system would really be intelligent—a philosophically controversial claim that ai researchers do not have to endorse though some do as for the first point people do not normally regard vision or locomotion as examples of intelligence many people would say that speaking ones native language is not a case of intelligence either except in comparison with nonhuman species and common sense is sometimes contrasted with intelligence the term is usually reserved for special cases of human thought that show exceptional creativity and subtlety or which require many years of formal education medical diagnosis scientific or legal reasoning playing chess and translating from one language to another are typically regarded as difficult thus requiring intelligence and these tasks were the main focus of research when ai began vision for example was assumed to be relatively straightforward—not least because many nonhuman animals have it too it gradually became clear however that everyday capacities such as vision and locomotion are vastly more complex than had been supposed the early definition of ai as programming computers to do things that involve intelligence when done by people was recognized as misleading and eventually dropped similarly intelligence is often opposed to emotion many people assume that ai could never model that however crude examples of such models existed in the early 1960s and emotion was recognized by a high priest of ai herbert simon as being essential to any complex intelligence later research in the computational philosophy and modeling of affect showed that emotions have evolved as scheduling mechanisms for systems with many different and potentially conflicting purposes minsky 1985 and web site when ai began it was difficult enough to get a program to follow one goal with its subgoals intelligently—any more than that was essentially impossible for this reason among others ai modeling of emotion was put on the back burner for about thirty years by the 1990s however it had become a popular focus of ai research and of neuroscience and philosophy too the third point raises the difficult question—which many ai practitioners leave open or even ignore—of whether intentionality can properly be ascribed to any conceivable programrobot newell 1980 dennett 1987 harnad 1991 ai and intentionality could some nlp programs really understand the sentences they parse and the words they translate or can a visuomotor circuit evolved within a robots neuralnetwork brain truly be said to represent the environmental feature to which it responds if a program in practice could pass the turing test could it truly be said to think more generally does it even make sense to say that ai may one day achieve artificially produced but nonetheless genuine intelligence for the many people in the field who adopt some form of functionalism the answer in each case is in principle yes this applies for those who favor the physical symbol system hypothesis or intentional systems theory others adopt connectionist analyses of concepts and of their development from nonconceptual content functionalism is criticized by many writers expert in neuroscience who claim that its core thesis of multiple realizability is mistaken others criticize it at an even deeper level a growing minority especially in alife reject neocartesian approaches in favor of philosophies of embodiment such as phenomenology or autopoiesis part of the reason why such questions are so difficult is that philosophers disagree about what intentionality is even in the human case practitioners of psychological ai generally believe that semantic content or intentionality can be naturalized but they differ about how this can be done for instance a few practitioners of ai regard computation and intentionality as metaphysically inseparable smith 1996 others ascribe meaning only to computations with certain causal consequences and provenance or grounding john searle argues that ai cannot capture intentionality because—at base—it is concerned with the formal manipulation of formal symbols and for

through mechanical or computational processes some or all aspects of human intelligence included among these aspects of intelligence are the ability to interact with the environment through sensory means and the ability to make decisions in unforeseen circumstances without human intervention typical areas of research in ai include the playing of games such as checkers or chess natural language understanding and synthesis computer vision problem solving machine learning and roboticsthe above is a general description of the field there is no agreedupon definition of artificial intelligence primarily because there is little agreement as to what constitutes intelligence interpretations of what it means to say an agent is intelligent vary yet most can be categorized in one of three ways intelligence can be thought of as a quality an individually held property that is separable from all other properties of the human person intelligence is also seen in the functions one performs in ones actions or the ability to carry out certain tasks finally some researchers see intelligence as something primarily acquired and demonstrated through relationship with other intelligent beings each of these understandings of intelligence has been used as the basis of an approach to developing computer programs with intelligent characteristicspropertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent114 the field of ai is considered to have its origin in the publication of alan turings paper computing machinery and intelligence 1950 john mccarthy coined the term artificial intelligence six years later at a summer conference at dartmouth college in new hampshire the earliest approach to ai is called symbolic or classical ai which is predicated on the hypothesis that every process in which either a human being or a machine engages can be expressed by a string of symbols that is modifiable according to a limited set of rules that can be logically defined just as geometers begin with a finite set of axioms and primitive objects such as points so symbolicists following such rationalist philosophers as ludwig wittgenstein and alfred north whitehead predicated that human thought is represented in the mind by concepts that can be broken down into basic rules and primitive objects simple concepts or objects are directly expressed by a single symbol while more complex ideas are the product of many symbols combined by certain rules for a symbolicist any patternable kind of matter can thus represent intelligent thought symbolic ai met with immediate success in areas in which problems could be easily described using a small set of objects that operate in a limited domain in a highly rulebased manner such as games the game of chess takes place in a world where the only objects are thirtytwo pieces moving on a sixtyfoursquare board according to a limited number of rules the limited options this world provides give the computer the potential to look far ahead examining all possible moves and countermoves looking for a sequence that will leave its pieces in the most advantageous position other successes for symbolic ai occurred rapidly in similarly restricted domains such as medical diagnosis mineral prospecting chemical analysis and mathematical theorem proving these early successes led to a number of remarkably optimistic predictions of the prospects for symbolic ai symbolic ai faltered however not on difficult problems like passing a calculus exam but on the easy things a twoyearold child can do such as recognizing a face in various settings or understanding a simple story mccarthy labels symbolic programs as brittle because they crack or break down at the edges they cannot function outside or near the edges of their domain of expertise since they lack knowledge outside of that domain knowledge that most human experts possess in the form of what is often called common sense humans make use of general knowledge millions of things we know and apply to a situation both consciously and subconsciously should such a set exist it is now clear to ai researchers that the set of primitive facts necessary for representing human knowledge is exceedingly large propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent214 another critique of symbolic ai advanced by terry winograd and fernando flores understanding computers and cognition 1986 is that human intelligence may not be a process of symbol manipulation humans do not carry mental models around in their heads when a human being learns to ride a bicycle he or she does not do so by calculating equations of trajectory or force hubert dreyfus makes a similar argument in mind over machine 1986 he suggests that experts do not arrive at their solutions to problems through the application of rules or the manipulation of symbols but rather use intuition acquired through multiple experiences in the real world he describes symbolic ai as a degenerating research project by which he means that while promising at first it has produced fewer results as time has progressed and is likely to be abandoned should other alternatives become available his prediction has proven to be fairly accurate by 2000 the once dominant symbolic approach had been all but abandoned in ai with only one major ongoing project douglas lenats cyc project lenat hopes to overcome the general knowledge problem by providing an extremely large base of primitive facts lenat plans to combine this large database with the ability to communicate in a natural language hoping that once enough information is entered into cyc the computer will be able to continue the learning process on its own through conversation reading and applying logical rules to detect patterns or inconsistencies in the data cyc is given initially conceived in 1984 as a tenyear initiative cyc has yet to show convincing evidence of extended independent learning symbolic ai is not completely dead however the primacy of primitive objects representable by some system of encoding is a basic assumption underlying the worldview that everything can be thought of in terms of information a view that has been advanced by several physicists including freeman dyson frank tipler and stephen wolfram functional or weak ai in 1980 john searle in the paper minds brains and programs introduced a division of the field of ai into strong and weak ai strong ai denoted the attempt to develop a full humanlike intelligence while weak ai denoted the use of ai techniques to either better understand human reasoning or to solve more limited problems although there was little progress in developing a strong ai through symbolic programming methods the attempt to program computers to carry out limited human functions has been quite successful much of what is currently labeled ai research follows a functional model applying particular programming techniques such as knowledge engineering fuzzy logic genetic algorithms neural networking heuristic searching and machine learning via statistical methods to practical problems this view sees ai as advanced computing it produces working programs that can take over certain human tasks especially in situations where there is limited human control or where the knowledge needed to solve a problem cannot be fully anticipated by human programmers such programs are used in manufacturing operations transportation education financial markets smart buildings and even household appliances propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent314 for a functional ai there need be no quality labeled intelligence that is shared by humans and computers all computers need do is perform a task that requires intelligence for a human to perform it is also unnecessary in functional ai to model a program after the thought processes that humans use if results are what matter then it is possible to exploit the speed and storage capabilities of the digital computer while ignoring parts of human thought that are not understood or easily modeled such as intuition this is in fact what was done in designing the chessplaying program deep blue which beat the reigning world champion garry kasparov in 1997 deep blue does not attempt to mimic the thought of a human chess player instead it capitalizes on the strengths of the computer by examining an extremely large number of moves more than any human could possibly examine there are two problems with functional ai the first is the difficulty of determining what falls into the category of ai and what is simply a normal computer application a definition of ai that includes any program that accomplishes some function normally done by a human being would encompass virtually all computer programs even among computer scientists there is little agreement as to what sorts of programs fall under the rubric of ai once an application is mastered there is a tendency to no longer define that application as ai for example while game playing is one of the classical fields of ai deep blues design team emphatically stated that deep blue was not artificial intelligence since it used standard programming and parallel processing techniques that were in no way designed to mimic human thought the implication here is that merely programming a computer to complete a human task is not ai if the computer does not complete the task in the same way a human would for a functional approach to result in a full humanlike intelligence it would be necessary not only to specify which functions make up intelligence but also to make sure those functions are suitably congruent with one another functional ai programs are rarely designed to be compatible with other programs—each uses different techniques and methods the sum of which is unlikely to capture the whole of human intelligence many in the ai community are also dissatisfied with a collection of taskoriented programs the building of a general humanlike intelligence as difficult a goal as it may seem remains the vision a relational approach propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent414 a third approach to ai builds on the assumption that intelligence is acquired held and demonstrated only through relationships with other intelligent agents in computing machinery and intelligence turing addresses the question of which functions are essential for intelligence with a proposal for what has come to be the generally accepted test for machine intelligence a human interrogator is connected by terminal to two subjects one a human and the other a machine if the interrogator fails as often as he or she succeeds in determining which is the human and which the machine the machine could be considered intelligent the turing test is based not on the completion of any particular task or the solution of any particular problems by the machine but on the machines ability to relate to a human being in conversation discourse is unique among human activities in that it subsumes all other activities within itself turing predicted that by the year 2000 there would be computers that could fool an interrogator at least 30 percent of the time this like most predictions in ai was overly optimistic no computer has yet come close to passing the turing test the turing test uses relational discourse to demonstrate intelligence however turing also notes the importance of being in relationship for the acquisition of knowledge or intelligence he estimates that the programming of background knowledge needed for a restricted form of the game would take at a minimum three hundred personyears to complete this is assuming that one could identify the appropriate knowledge set at the outset turing suggests rather than trying to imitate an adult mind that one construct a mind that simulates that of a child such a mind when given an appropriate education would learn and develop into an adult mind one ai researcher taking this approach is rodney brooks of the massachusetts institute of technology mit whose robotics lab has constructed several machines the most famous of which are named cog and kismet that represent a new direction in ai in that embodiedness is crucial to their design their programming is distributed among the various physical parts each joint has a small processor that controls movement of that joint these processors are linked with faster processors that allow for interaction between joints and for movement of the robot as a whole cog and kismet are no longer minds in a box but embodied systems that depend on interaction within a complex environment they are designed to learn those tasks associated with newborns such as eyehand coordination object grasping face recognition and basic emotional responses through social interaction with a team of researchers although they have developed such abilities as tracking moving objects with the eyes or withdrawing an arm when touched brookss project has so far been no more successful than lenats cyc in producing a machine that could interact with humans on the level of the turing test however brookss work represents a movement toward turings opinion that intelligence is socially acquired and demonstrated the turing test makes no assumptions as to how the computer would arrive at its answers there need be no similarity in internal functioning between the computer and the human brain however an area of ai that shows some promise is that of neural networks systems of circuitry that reproduce the patterns of neurons found in the brain current neural nets are limited however the human brain has billions of neurons and researchers have yet to understand both how these neurons are connected and how the various neurotransmitting chemicals in the brain function despite these limitations neural nets have reproduced interesting behaviors in areas such as speech or image recognition naturallanguage processing and learning some researchers eg hans moravec raymond kurzweil look to neural net research as a way to reverse engineer the brain they hope that once scientists have the capability of designing nets with a complexity equal to that of the brain they will find that the nets have the same power as the brain and will develop consciousness as an emergent property kurzweil posits that such mechanical brains when programmed with a given persons memories and talents could form a new path to immortality while moravec holds out hopes that such machines might some day become our evolutionary children capable of greater abilities than humans currently demonstrate ai in science fiction propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent514 while some advances have been made a truly intelligent computer currently remains in the realm of speculation though researchers have continually projected that intelligent computers are imminent progress in ai has been limited computers with intentionality and selfconsciousness with fully human reasoning skills or the ability to be in relationship exist only in the realm of dreams and desires a realm explored in fiction and fantasy the artificially intelligent computer in science fiction story and film is not a prop but a character one that has become a staple since the mid1950s these characters are embodied in a variety of physical forms ranging from the wholly mechanical computers and robots to the partially mechanical cyborgs to the completely biological androids a general trend from the 1950s to the 1990s has been to depict intelligent computers in an increasingly anthropomorphic way the robots and computers of early films such as maria in metropolis 1926 robby in forbidden planet 1956 hal in 2001 a space odyssey 1968 or r2d2 and c3po in star wars 1977 were clearly constructs of metal on the other hand early science fiction stories such as isaac asimovs i robot 1950 explored the question of how one might distinguish between robots that looked human and actual human beings films and stories since the 1980s such as blade runner 1982 the terminator series 1984–2002 and ai artificial intelligence 2001 depict machines with both mechanical and biological parts that are at least superficially practically indistinguishable from human beings fiction that features ai can be classified in two general categories the first comprises cautionary tales that explore the consequences of creating technology for the purposes of taking over human functions in these stories the initial impulses for creating an artificial intelligence are noble to preserve the wisdom of a race forbidden planet to avoid nuclear war colossus the forbin project 1970 or to advance human knowledge 2001 a space odyssey the human characters suppose that they are completely in control only to find that they have in the end abdicated too much responsibility to something that is ultimately other to the human species the second category comprises tales of wish fulfillment star wars i robot in which the robots are not noted for their superior intelligence or capabilities but for the cheerful assistance and companionship they give their human masters the computers in these stories are rooted in a relational rather than a functional view of human intelligence religious and ethical implications many researchers in ai are committed physicalists and believe that the design of a truly intelligent machine will vindicate their belief that human beings are nothing but biological machines few would consider religious questions to be of import to their work one exception to this stance has been the robotics laboratory at mit which included a religious adviser anne foerst as part of the research team developing the robot cog however the assumptions that human beings are merely informationprocessing machines and that artifacts that are nonbiological can be genuinely intelligent have both anthropological and eschatological implications the most important questions raised by ai research are anthropological ones what does it mean to be human at what point would replacing some or all of our biological parts with mechanical components violate our integrity as human beings is our relationship to god contingent on our biological nature what is the relationship of the soul to consciousness or intelligence these questions are raised by the search for an artificial intelligence irrespective of whether or not that search is ever successful should that search be successful ethical problems arise what rights would an intelligent robot have would these be the same rights as a human being should an artificial intelligence be held to the same standards of moral responsibility as human beings should a robot be baptized or take part in other sacramental or covenantal acts how one answers such questions depends largely on what one sees as central to our nature as human beings—mind body function or relationship once again whether ai becomes a reality or not the debate over questions such as these is helpful in clarifying the principles on which our view of humanity rests ai also raises a set of ethical issues relevant to the search itself in a controversial article in wired 2000 bill joy chief scientist at sun microsystems warns that selfreplicating robots and advances in nanotechnology could result as soon as 2030 in a computer technology that may replace our species moravec of the ai lab at carnegie mellon university pushes the time back to 2040 but agrees that robots will displace humans from essential roles and could threaten our existence as a species joy calls for research in the possibly convergent fields of artificial intelligence nanotechnology and biotechnology to be suspended until researchers have greater certainty that such research would in no way threaten future human lives on a lesser scale the amount of responsibility the human community wishes to invest in autonomous or semiautonomous machines remains a question the view of human identity as the information in ones brain has led several researchers to posit a new cybernetic form for human immortality in the age of spiritual machines 1999 kurzweil predicts that by the end of the twentyfirst century artificial intelligence will have resulted in effective immortality for humans he expects that the merger of human and machinebased intelligences will have progressed to the point where most conscious entities will no longer have a permanent physical presence but will move between mechanically enhanced bodies and machines in such a way that ones life expectancy will be indefinitely extended kurzweil is not the sole holder of this expectation though he may be among the more optimistic in his timeline physicists dyson and tipler suggest a future in which human identity is located in the information that makes up the thoughts memories and experiences of each person in the physics of immortality modern cosmology god and the resurrection of the dead 1994 tipler conjectures that the universe will cease to expand and at some point end in a contraction that he calls the omega point tipler sees the omega point as the coalescence of all information including the information that has made up every person who ever lived this point can thus be seen as corresponding to the omniscient and omnipotent god referred to in many different religious traditions at such a point the information making up any given individual could be reinstantiated resulting in a form of resurrection for that person a cybernetic immortality cybernetic immortality provides one avenue for belief in a manner of human continuance that does not violate the assumption of a material basis for all existence it is thus compatible with the most rigorous scientific theories of the natural world however cybernetic immortality is based on the assumptions that thoughts and memories define the human person and that consciousness is an emergent property of the complexity of the human brain in other words human beings are basically biological machines whose unique identity is found in the patterns that arise and are stored in the neuronal structures of the brain if these patterns could be replicated as in sophisticated computer technology the defining characteristics of the person would be preserved such a view is not necessarily compatible with the anthropologies of most religions see also cybernetics bibliography daniel creviers ai the tumultuous history of the search for artificial intelligence new york 1993 provides a clear history of the first forty years of ai research a more critical view of

that such research would in no way threaten future human lives on a lesser scale the amount of responsibility the human community wishes to invest in autonomous or semiautonomous machines remains a question the view of human identity as the information in ones brain has led several researchers to posit a new cybernetic form for human immortality in the age of spiritual machines 1999 kurzweil predicts that by the end of the twentyfirst century artificial intelligence will have resulted in effective immortality for humans he expects that the merger of human and machinebased intelligences will have progressed to the point where most conscious entities will no longer have a permanent physical presence but will move between mechanically enhanced bodies and machines in such a way that ones life expectancy will be indefinitely extended kurzweil is not the sole holder of this expectation though he may be among the more optimistic in his timeline physicists dyson and tipler suggest a future in which human identity is located in the information that makes up the thoughts memories and experiences of each person in the physics of immortality modern cosmology god and the resurrection of the dead 1994 tipler conjectures that the universe will cease to expand and at some point end in a contraction that he calls the omega point tipler sees the omega point as the coalescence of all information including the information that has made up every person who ever lived this point can thus be seen as corresponding to the omniscient and omnipotent god referred to in many different religious traditions at such a point the information making up any given individual could be reinstantiated resulting in a form of resurrection for that person a cybernetic immortality cybernetic immortality provides one avenue for belief in a manner of human continuance that does not violate the assumption of a material basis for all existence it is thus compatible with the most rigorous scientific theories of the natural world however cybernetic immortality is based on the assumptions that thoughts and memories define the human person and that consciousness is an emergent property of the complexity of the human brain in other words human beings are basically biological machines whose unique identity is found in the patterns that arise and are stored in the neuronal structures of the brain if these patterns could be replicated as in sophisticated computer technology the defining characteristics of the person would be preserved such a view is not necessarily compatible with the anthropologies of most religions see also cybernetics bibliography daniel creviers ai the tumultuous history of the search for artificial intelligence new york 1993 provides a clear history of the

cybernetic imagination in science fiction cambridge mass 1980 for theological implications see noreen l herzfeld in our image artificial intelligence and the human spirit minneapolis 2002 noreen l herzfeld 2005another critique of symbolic ai advanced by terry winograd and fernando flores understanding computers and cognition 1986 is that human intelligence may not be a process of symbol manipulation humans do not carry mental models around in their heads when a human being learns to ride a bicycle he or she does not do so by calculating equations of trajectory or force hubert dreyfus makes a similar argument in mind over machine 1986 he suggests that experts do not arrive at their solutions to problems through the application of rules or the manipulation of symbols but rather use intuition acquired through multiple experiences in the real world he describes symbolic ai as a degenerating research project by which he means that while promising at first it has produced fewer results as time has progressed and is likely to be abandoned should other alternatives become available his prediction has proven to be fairly accurate by 2000 the once dominant symbolic approach had been all but abandoned in ai with only one major ongoing project douglas lenats cyc project lenat hopes to overcome the general knowledge problem by providing an extremely large base of primitive facts lenat plans to combine this large database with the ability to communicate in a natural language hoping that once enough information is entered into cyc the computer will be able to continue the learning process on its own through conversation reading and applying logical rules to detect patterns or inconsistencies in the data cyc is given initially conceived in 1984 as a tenyear initiative cyc has yet to show convincing evidence of extended independent learningsymbolic ai is not completely dead however the primacy of primitive objects representable by some system of encoding is a basic assumption underlying the worldview that everything can be thought of in terms of information a view that has been advanced by several physicists including freeman dyson frank tipler and stephen wolframin 1980 john searle in the paper minds brains and programs introduced a division of the field of ai into strong and weak ai strong ai denoted the attempt to develop a full humanlike intelligence while weak ai denoted the use of ai techniques to either better understand human reasoning or to solve more limited problems although there was little progress in developing a strong ai through symbolic programming methods the attempt to program computers to carry out limited human functions has been quite successful much of what is currently labeled ai research follows a functional model applying particular programming techniques such as knowledge engineering fuzzy logic genetic algorithms neural networking heuristic searching and machine learning via statistical methods to practical problems this view sees ai as advanced computing it produces working programs that can take over certain human tasks especially in situations where there is limited human control or where the knowledge needed to solve a problem cannot be fully anticipated by human programmers such programs are used in manufacturing operations transportation education financial markets smart buildings and even household appliancespropertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent314 for a functional ai there need be no quality labeled intelligence that is shared by humans and computers all computers need do is perform a task that requires intelligence for a human to perform it is also unnecessary in functional ai to model a program after the thought processes that humans use if results are what matter then it is possible to exploit the speed and storage capabilities of the digital computer while ignoring parts of human thought that are not understood or easily modeled such as intuition this is in fact what was done in designing the chessplaying program deep blue which beat the reigning world champion garry kasparov in 1997 deep blue does not attempt to mimic the thought of a human chess player instead it capitalizes on the strengths of the computer by examining an extremely large number of moves more than any human could possibly examine there are two problems with functional ai the first is the difficulty of determining what falls into the category of ai and what is simply a normal computer application a definition of ai that includes any program that accomplishes some function normally done by a human being would encompass virtually all computer programs even among computer scientists there is little agreement as to what sorts of programs fall under the rubric of ai once an application is mastered there is a tendency to no longer define that application as ai for example while game playing is one of the classical fields of ai deep blues design team emphatically stated that deep blue was not artificial intelligence since it used standard programming and parallel processing techniques that were in no way designed to mimic human thought the implication here is that merely programming a computer to complete a human task is not ai if the computer does not complete the task in the same way a human would for a functional approach to result in a full humanlike intelligence it would be necessary not only to specify which functions make up intelligence but also to make sure those functions are suitably congruent with one another functional ai programs are rarely designed to be compatible with other programs—each uses different techniques and methods the sum of which is unlikely to capture the whole of human intelligence many in the ai community are also dissatisfied with a collection of taskoriented programs the building of a general humanlike intelligence as difficult a goal as it may seem remains the vision a relational approach propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent414 a third approach to ai builds on the assumption that intelligence is acquired held and demonstrated only through relationships with other intelligent agents in computing machinery and intelligence turing addresses the question of which functions are essential for intelligence with a proposal for what has come to be the generally accepted test for machine intelligence a human interrogator is connected by terminal to two subjects one a human and the other a machine if the interrogator fails as often as he or she succeeds in determining which is the human and which the machine the machine could be considered intelligent the turing test is based not on the completion of any particular task or the solution of any particular problems by the machine but on the machines ability to relate to a human being in conversation discourse is unique among human activities in that it subsumes all other activities within itself turing predicted that by the year 2000 there would be computers that could fool an interrogator at least 30 percent of the time this like most predictions in ai was overly optimistic no computer has yet come close to passing the turing test the turing test uses relational discourse to demonstrate intelligence however turing also notes the importance of being in relationship for the acquisition of knowledge or intelligence he estimates that the programming of background knowledge needed for a restricted form of the game would take at a minimum three hundred personyears to complete this is assuming that one could identify the appropriate knowledge set at the outset turing suggests rather than trying to imitate an adult mind that one construct a mind that simulates that of a child such a mind when given an appropriate education would learn and develop into an adult mind one ai researcher taking this approach is rodney brooks of the massachusetts institute of technology mit whose robotics lab has constructed several machines the most famous of which are named cog and kismet that represent a new direction in ai in that embodiedness is crucial to their design their programming is distributed among the various physical parts each joint has a small processor that controls movement of that joint these processors are linked with faster processors that allow for interaction between joints and for movement of the robot as a whole cog and kismet are no longer minds in a box but embodied systems that depend on interaction within a complex environment they are designed to learn those tasks associated with newborns such as eyehand coordination object grasping face recognition and basic emotional responses through social interaction with a team of researchers although they have developed such abilities as tracking moving objects with the eyes or withdrawing an arm when touched brookss project has so far been no more successful than lenats cyc in producing a machine that could interact with humans on the level of the turing test however brookss work represents a movement toward turings opinion that intelligence is socially acquired and demonstrated the turing test makes no assumptions as to how the computer would arrive at its answers there need be no similarity in internal functioning between the computer and the human brain however an area of ai that shows some promise is that of neural networks systems of circuitry that reproduce the patterns of neurons found in the brain current neural nets are limited however the human brain has billions of neurons and researchers have yet to understand both how these neurons are connected and how the various neurotransmitting chemicals in the brain function despite these limitations neural nets have reproduced interesting behaviors in areas such as speech or image recognition naturallanguage processing and learning some researchers eg hans moravec raymond kurzweil look to neural net research as a way to reverse engineer the brain they hope that once scientists have the capability of designing nets with a complexity equal to that of the brain they will find that the nets have the same power as the brain and will develop consciousness as an emergent property kurzweil posits that such mechanical brains when programmed with a given persons memories and talents could form a new path to immortality while moravec holds out hopes that such machines might some day become our evolutionary children capable of greater abilities than humans currently demonstrate ai in science fiction propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent514 while some advances have been made a truly intelligent computer currently remains in the realm of speculation though researchers have continually projected that intelligent computers are imminent progress in ai has been limited computers with intentionality and selfconsciousness with fully human reasoning skills or the ability to be in relationship exist only in the realm of dreams and desires a realm explored in fiction and fantasy the artificially intelligent computer in science fiction story and film is not a prop but a character one that has become a staple since the mid1950s these characters are embodied in a variety of physical forms ranging from the wholly mechanical computers and robots to the partially mechanical cyborgs to the completely biological androids a general trend from the 1950s to the 1990s has been to depict intelligent computers in an increasingly anthropomorphic way the robots and computers of early films such as maria in metropolis 1926 robby in forbidden planet 1956 hal in 2001 a space odyssey 1968 or r2d2 and c3po in star wars 1977 were clearly constructs of metal on the other hand early science fiction stories such as isaac asimovs i robot 1950 explored the question of how one might distinguish between robots that looked human and actual human beings films and stories since the 1980s such as blade runner 1982 the terminator series 1984–2002 and ai artificial intelligence 2001 depict machines with both mechanical and biological parts that are at least superficially practically indistinguishable from human beings fiction that features ai can be classified in two general categories the first comprises cautionary tales that explore the consequences of creating technology for the purposes of taking over human functions in these stories the initial impulses for creating an artificial intelligence are noble to preserve the wisdom of a race forbidden planet to avoid nuclear war colossus the forbin project 1970 or to advance human knowledge 2001 a space odyssey the human characters suppose that they are completely in control only to find that they have in the end abdicated too much responsibility to something that is ultimately other to the human species the second category comprises tales of wish fulfillment star wars i robot in which the robots are not noted for their superior intelligence or capabilities but for the cheerful assistance and companionship they give their human masters the computers in these stories are rooted in a relational rather than a functional view of human intelligence religious and ethical implications many researchers in ai are committed physicalists and believe that the design of a truly intelligent machine will vindicate their belief that human beings are nothing but biological machines few would consider religious questions to be of import to their work one exception to this stance has been the robotics laboratory at mit which included a religious adviser anne foerst as part of the research team developing the robot cog however the assumptions that human beings are merely informationprocessing machines and that artifacts that are nonbiological can be genuinely intelligent have both anthropological and eschatological implications the most important questions raised by ai research are anthropological ones what does it mean to be human at what point would replacing some or all of our biological parts with mechanical components violate our integrity as human beings is our relationship to god contingent on our biological nature what is the relationship of the soul to consciousness or intelligence these questions are raised by the search for an artificial intelligence irrespective of whether or not that search is ever successful should that search be successful ethical problems arise what rights would an intelligent robot have would these be the same rights as a human being should an artificial intelligence be held to the same standards of moral responsibility as human beings should a robot be baptized or take part in other sacramental or covenantal acts how one answers such questions depends largely on what one sees as central to our nature as human beings—mind body function or relationship once again whether ai becomes a reality or not the debate over questions such as these is helpful in clarifying the principles on which our view of humanity rests ai also raises a set of ethical issues relevant to the search itself in a

one could identify the appropriate knowledge set at the outset turing suggests rather than trying to imitate an adult mind that one construct a mind that simulates that of a child such a mind when given an appropriate education would learn and develop into an adult mind one ai researcher taking this approach is rodney brooks of the massachusetts institute of technology mit whose robotics lab has constructed several machines the most famous of which are named cog and kismet that represent a new direction in ai in that embodiedness is crucial to their design their programming is distributed among the various physical parts each joint has a small processor that controls movement of that joint these processors are linked with faster processors that allow for interaction between joints and for movement of the robot as a whole cog and kismet are no longer minds in a box but embodied systems that depend on interaction within a complex environment they are designed to learn those tasks associated with newborns such as eyehand coordination object grasping face recognition and basic emotional responses through social interaction with a team of researchers although they have developed such abilities as tracking moving objects with the eyes or withdrawing an arm when touched brookss project has so far been no more successful than lenats cyc in producing a machine that could interact with humans on the level of the turing test however brookss work represents a movement toward turings opinion that intelligence is socially acquired and demonstratedthe turing test makes no assumptions as to how the computer would arrive at its answers there need be no similarity in internal functioning between the computer and the human brain however an area of ai that shows some promise is that of neural networks systems of circuitry that reproduce the patterns of neurons found in the brain current neural nets are limited however the human brain has billions of neurons and researchers have yet to understand both how these neurons are connected and how the various neurotransmitting chemicals in the brain function despite these limitations neural nets have reproduced interesting behaviors in areas such as speech or image recognition naturallanguage processing and learning some researchers eg hans moravec raymond kurzweil look to neural net research as a way to reverse engineer the brain they hope that once scientists have the capability of designing nets with a complexity equal to that of the brain they will find that the nets have the same power as the brain and will develop consciousness as an emergent property kurzweil posits that such mechanical brains when programmed with a given persons memories and talents could form a new path to immortality while moravec holds out hopes that such machines might some day become our evolutionary children capable of greater abilities than humans currently demonstratepropertagcmdpushfunction

intelligent computers are imminent progress in ai has been limited computers with intentionality and selfconsciousness with fully human reasoning skills or the ability to be in relationship exist only in the realm of dreams and desires a realm explored in fiction and fantasy the artificially intelligent computer in science fiction story and film is not a prop but a character one that has become a staple since the mid1950s these characters are embodied in a variety of physical forms ranging from the wholly mechanical computers and robots to the partially mechanical cyborgs to the completely biological androids a general trend from the 1950s to the 1990s has been to depict intelligent computers in an increasingly anthropomorphic way the robots and computers of early films such as maria in metropolis 1926 robby in forbidden planet 1956 hal in 2001 a space odyssey 1968 or r2d2 and c3po in star wars 1977 were clearly constructs of metal on the other hand early science fiction stories such as isaac asimovs i robot 1950 explored the question of how one might distinguish between robots that looked human and actual human beings films and stories since the 1980s such as blade runner 1982 the terminator series 1984–2002 and ai artificial intelligence 2001 depict machines with both mechanical and biological parts that are at least superficially practically indistinguishable from human beings fiction that features ai can be classified in two general categories the first comprises cautionary tales that explore the consequences of creating technology for the purposes of taking over human functions in these stories the initial impulses for creating an artificial intelligence are noble to preserve the wisdom of a race forbidden planet to avoid nuclear war colossus the forbin project 1970 or to advance human knowledge 2001 a space odyssey the human characters suppose that they are completely in control only to find that they have in the end abdicated too much responsibility to something that is ultimately other to the human species the second category comprises tales of wish fulfillment star wars i robot in which the robots are not noted for their superior intelligence or capabilities but for the cheerful assistance and companionship they give their human masters the computers in these stories are rooted in a relational rather than a functional view of human intelligence religious and ethical implications many researchers in ai are committed physicalists and believe that the design of a truly intelligent machine will vindicate their belief that human beings are nothing but biological machines few would consider religious questions to be of import to their work one exception to this stance has been the robotics laboratory at mit which included a religious adviser anne foerst as part of the research team developing the robot cog however the assumptions that human beings are merely informationprocessing machines and that artifacts that are nonbiological can be genuinely intelligent have both anthropological and eschatological implications the most important questions raised by ai research are anthropological ones what does it mean to be human at what point would replacing some or all of our biological parts with mechanical components violate our integrity as human beings is our relationship to god contingent on our biological nature what is the relationship of the soul to consciousness or intelligence these questions are raised by the search for an artificial intelligence irrespective of whether or not that search is ever successful should that search be successful ethical problems arise what rights would an intelligent robot have would these be the same rights as a human being should an artificial intelligence be held to the same standards of moral responsibility as human beings should a robot be baptized or take part in other sacramental or covenantal acts how one answers such questions depends largely on what one sees as central to our nature as human beings—mind body function or relationship once again whether ai becomes a reality or not the debate over questions such as these is helpful in clarifying the principles on which our view of humanity rests ai also raises a set of ethical issues relevant to the search itself in a controversial article in wired 2000 bill joy chief scientist at sun microsystems warns that selfreplicating robots and advances in nanotechnology could result as soon as 2030 in a computer technology that may replace our species moravec of the ai lab at carnegie mellon university pushes the time back to 2040 but agrees that robots will displace humans from essential roles and could threaten our existence as a species joy calls for research in the possibly convergent fields of artificial intelligence nanotechnology and biotechnology to be suspended until researchers have greater certainty that such research would in no way threaten future human lives on a lesser scale the amount of responsibility the human community wishes to invest in autonomous or semiautonomous machines remains a question the view of human identity as the information in ones brain has led several researchers to posit a new cybernetic form for human immortality in the age of spiritual machines 1999 kurzweil predicts that by the end of the twentyfirst century artificial intelligence will have resulted in effective immortality for humans he expects that the merger of human and machinebased intelligences will have progressed to the point where most conscious entities will no longer have a permanent physical presence but will move between mechanically enhanced bodies and machines in such a way that ones life expectancy will be indefinitely extended kurzweil is not the sole holder of this expectation though he may be among the more optimistic in his timeline physicists dyson and tipler suggest a future in which human identity is located in the information that makes up the thoughts memories and experiences of each person in the physics of immortality modern cosmology god and the resurrection of the dead 1994 tipler conjectures that the universe will cease to expand and at some point end in a contraction that he calls the omega point tipler sees the omega point as the coalescence of all information including the information that has made up every person who ever lived this point can thus be seen as corresponding to the omniscient and omnipotent god referred to in many different religious traditions at such a point the information making up any given individual could be reinstantiated resulting in a form of resurrection for that person a cybernetic immortality cybernetic immortality provides one avenue for belief in a manner of human continuance that does not violate the assumption of a material basis for all existence it is thus compatible with the most rigorous scientific theories of the natural world however cybernetic immortality is based on the assumptions that thoughts and memories define the human person and that consciousness is an emergent property of the complexity of the human brain in other words human beings are basically biological machines whose unique identity is found in the patterns that arise and are stored in the neuronal structures of the brain if these patterns could be replicated as in sophisticated computer technology the defining characteristics of the person would be preserved such a view is not necessarily compatible with the anthropologies of most religions see also cybernetics

visionroboticscomputerassisted instructionresourcescertain tasks can be performed faster and more accurately by traditionally programmed computers than by human beings particularly numerical computation and the storage retrieval and sorting of large quantities of information however the ability of computers to interact flexibly with the real world— their “intelligence”—remains slight artificial intelligence ai is a subfield of computer science that seeks to remedy this situation by creating software and hardware that possesses some of the behavioral flexibility shown by natural intelligences both human and animalin the 1940s and 1950s the first large electronic digital computers were designed to perform numerical calculations set up by a human programmer the computers did so by completing a series of clearly defined steps or algorithms programmers wrote algorithmic software that precisely specified both the problem and how to solve it ai programmers in contrast have sought to program computers with flexible rules for seeking solutions to problems an ai program may be designed to modify the rules it is given or to develop entirely new rulespropertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent116 what types of problem are appropriate for traditional algorithmic computing and what types call out for ai some of the tasks that are hardest for people are fortunately algorithmic in nature teachers can describe in detail the process for multiplying numbers and accountants can state accurately the rules for completing tax forms yet many people have difficulty performing these tasks straightforward algorithmic programs can perform them easily because they can be broken down into a series of precise procedures or steps that do not vary from case to case on the other hand tasks that require little thought for human beings can be hard to translate into algorithms and therefore difficult or so far impossible for computers to perform for example most people know that a pot of boiling water requires careful handling we identify hot pots by flexible recognition of many possible signs steam rising radiant heat felt on the skin a glimpse of blue flame or red coils under the pot a rattling lid and so forth once we know that the pot is boiling we plan our actions accordingly this process seems simple yet describing exactly to a computer how to reliably conclude “this pot is hot” and to take appropriate action turns out to be extremely difficult the goal of ai is to create computers that can handle such complex flexible situations with intelligence one obstacle to this goal is our uncertainty or confusion about what is “intelligence” what is intelligence one possible definition of intelligence is the acquisition and application of knowledge an intelligent entity in this view is one that learns—acquires knowledge—and is able to apply this knowledge to changing realworld situations in this sense a rat is intelligent but most computers despite their impressive numbercrunching capabilities are not generally to qualify as intelligent an ai system must use some form of information or knowledge whether acquired from databases sensory devices trial and error or all of the above to make effective choices when confronted with data that are to some extent unpredictable insofar as a computer can do this it may be said for the purposes of ai to display intelligence note that this definition is purely functional and that in ai the question of consciousness though intriguing need not be considered this limited characterization of intelligence would perhaps have been considered overcautious by some ai researchers in the early days when optimism ran high for example us economist ai pioneer and nobel prize winner herbert simon 1916–2001 predicted in 1965 that by 1985 “machines will be capable of doing any work man can do” yet decades later despite exponential growth in memory size and processing speed no computer even comes close to commonplace human skills like conversing driving a car or diapering a baby much less “doing any work” a person can do why has progress in ai been so slow propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent216 one answer is that while intelligence as defined above requires knowledge computers are only good at handling information which is not the same thing knowledge is meaningful information and “meaning” is a nonmeasurable multivalued variable arising in the real world of things and values bits—“binary digits” 1s and 0s—have no meaning as such they are meaningful only when people assign meanings to them consider a single bit a “1” its information content is one bit regardless of what it means yet it may mean nothing or anything including “the circuit is connected” “we surrender” “it is more likely to rain than snow” and “i like apples” the question for ai is how can information be made meaningful to a computer simply adding more bits does not work for meaning arises not from information as such but from relationships involving the real world in one form or another this basic problem has stymied ai research for decades nor is it the only such problem another problem is that computers even those employing “fuzzy logic” and autonomous learning function by processing symbols eg 1s and 0s according to rules eg those of boolean algebra—yet human beings do not usually think by processing symbols according to rules humans are able think this way as when we do arithmetic but more commonly we interpret situations leap to conclusions utter sentences and plan actions using thought processes that do not involve symbolic computation at all what our thought processes really are—that is what our intelligence is precisely—and how to translate it into or mimic it by means of a system of computable symbols and rules is a problem that remains unsolved in general by ai researchers in 1950 british mathematician alan turing 1912–1954 proposed a hypothetical game to help decide the issue of whether a given machine is truly intelligent the “imitation game” as turing originally called it consisted of a human questioner in a room typing questions on a keyboard in another room an unseen respondent—either a human or a computer— would type back answers the questioner could pose queries to the respondent in an attempt to determine if he or she was corresponding with a human or a computer in turing’s opinion if the computer could fool the questioner into believing that he or she was having a dialog with a human being then the computer could be said to be truly intelligent the turing test is obviously biased toward human language prowess which most ai programs today do not even seek to emulate due to the extreme difficulty of the problem it is significant that even the most advanced ai programs devoted to natural language are as far as ever from passing the turing test “intelligence” has proved a far tougher nut to crack than the pioneers of ai believed half a century ago computers remain by human standards profoundly unintelligent even so ai has made many gains since the 1950s ai software is now present in many devices such as automatic teller machines atms that are part of daily life and is finding increasing commercial application in many industries overview of ai propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent316 all ai computer programs are built on two basic elements a knowledge base and an inferencing capability inferencing means drawing conclusions based on logic and prior knowledge a knowledge base is made up of many discrete units of information—representing facts concepts theories procedures and relationships—all relevant to a particular task or aspect of the world programs are written to give the computer the ability to manipulate this information and to reason make judgments reach conclusions and choose solutions to the problem at hand such as guessing whether a series of creditcard transactions involves fraud or driving an automated rover across a rocky martian landscape whereas conventional deterministic software must follow a strictly logical series of steps to reach a conclusion ai software uses the techniques of search and pattern matching it may also in some cases modify its knowledge base or its own structure “learn” pattern matching may still be algorithmic that is the computer must be told exactly where to look in its knowledge base and what constitutes a match the computer searches its knowledge base for specific conditions or patterns that fit the criteria of the problem to be solved microchips have increased computational speed allowing ai programs to quickly scan huge arrays of data for example computers can scan enough possible chess moves to provide a challenging opponent for even the best human players artificial intelligence has many other applications including problem solving in mathematics and other fields expert systems in medicine simple natural language processing robotics and education the ability of some ai programs to solve problems based on facts rather than on a predetermined series of steps is what most closely resembles “thinking” and causes some in the ai field to argue that such devices are indeed intelligent general problem solving problem solving is thus something ai does very well as long as the problem is narrow in focus and clearly defined for example mathematicians scientists and engineers are often called upon to prove theorems a theorem is a mathematical statement that is part of a larger theory or structure of ideas because the formulas involved in such tasks may be large and complex this can take an enormous amount of time thought and trial and error a specially designed ai program can reduce and simplify such formulas in a fraction of the time needed by human workers artificial intelligence can also assist with problems in planning an effective stepbystep sequence of actions that has the lowest cost and fewest steps is very important in business and manufacturing operations an ai program can be designed that includes all possible steps and outcomes the programmer must also set some criteria with which to judge the outcome such as whether speed is more important than cost in accomplishing the task or if lowest cost is the desired result regardless of how long it takes the plan generated by this type of ai program will take less time to generate than by traditional methods expert systems propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent416 the expert system is a major application of ai today also known as knowledgebased systems expert systems act as intelligent assistants to human experts or serve as a resource to people who may not have access to an expert the major difference between an expert system and a simple database containing information on a particular subject is that the database can only give the user discrete facts about the subject whereas an expert system uses reasoning to draw conclusions from stored information the purpose of this ai application is not to replace human experts but to make their knowledge and experience more widely available an expert system has three parts knowledge base inference engine and user interface the knowledge base contains both declarative factual and procedural rulesofusage knowledge in a very narrow field the inference engine runs the system by determining which procedural knowledge to access in order to obtain the appropriate declarative knowledge then draws conclusions and decides when an applicable solution is found an interface is usually defined as the point where the machine and the human “touch” an interface is usually a keyboard mouse or similar device in an expert system there are actually two different user interfaces one is for the designer of the system who is generally experienced with computers the other is for the user generally a computer novice because most users of an expert system will not be computer experts it is important that the system be easy for them to use all user interfaces are bidirectional that is are able to receive information from the user and respond to the user with recommendations the designer’s user interface must also be capable of adding new information to the knowledge base natural language processing propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent516 natural language is human language naturallanguageprocessing programs use artificial intelligence to allow a user to communicate with a computer in the user’s natural language the computer can both understand and respond to commands given in a natural language computer languages are artificial languages invented for the sake of communicating instructions to computers and enabling them to communicate with each other most computer languages consist of a combination of symbols numbers and some words these languages are complex and may take years to master by programming computers via computer languages to respond to our natural languages we make them easier to use however there are many problems in trying to make a computer understand people four problems arise that can cause misunderstanding 1 ambiguity— confusion over what is meant due to multiple meanings of words and phrases 2 imprecision—thoughts are sometimes expressed in vague and inexact terms 3 incompleteness—the entire idea is not presented and the listener is expected to “read between the lines” 4 inaccuracy—spelling punctuation and grammar problems can obscure meaning when we speak to one another furthermore we generally expect to be understood because our common language assumes all the meanings that we share as members of a specific cultural group to a nonnative speaker who shares less of our cultural background our meaning may not always be clear it is even more difficult for computers which have no share at all in the realworld relationships that confer meaning upon information to correctly interpret natural language propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent616 to alleviate these problems natural language processing programs seek to analyze syntax—the way words are put together in a sentence or phrase semantics—the derived meaning of the phrase or sentence and context—the meaning of distinct words within a sentence but even this is not enough the computer must also have access to a dictionary that contains definitions of every word and phrase it is likely to encounter and may also use keyword analysis—a patternmatching technique in which the program scans the text looking for words that it has been programmed to recognize if a keyword is found the program responds by manipulating the text to form a reasonable response in its simplest form a natural language processing program works like this a sentence is typed in on the keyboard if the program can derive meaning—that is if it has a reference in its knowledge base for every word and phrase—it will respond more or less appropriately an example of a computer with a natural language processor is the computerized card catalog available in many public libraries the main menu usually offers four choices for looking up information search by author search by title search by subject or search by keyword if you want a list of books on a specific topic or subject you type in the appropriate phrase you are asking the computer—in english—to tell you what is available on the topic the computer usually responds in a very short time—in english— with a list of books along with call numbers so you can find what you need computer vision computer vision is the use of a computer to analyze and evaluate visual information a camera is used to collect visual data the camera translates the image into a series of electrical signals this data is analog in nature—that is it is directly measurable and quantifiable a digital computer however operates using numbers expressed directly as digits it cannot read analog signals so the image must be digitized using an analogtodigital converter the image becomes a very long series of binary numbers that can be stored and interpreted by the computer just how long the series is depends on how densely packed the pixels are in the visual image to get an idea of pixels and digitized images take a close look at a newspaper photograph if you move the paper very close to your eyes you will notice that the image is a sequence of black and white dots—called pixels for picture elements—arranged in a certain pattern when you move the picture away from your eyes the picture becomes clearly defined and your brain is able to recognize the image artificial intelligence works much the same way clues provided by the arrangement of pixels in the image give information as to the relative color and texture of an object as well as the distance between objects in this way the computer can interpret and analyze visual images in the field of robotics visual analysis is very important robotics robotics is the study of robots which are machines that can be programmed to perform manual tasks most robots in use today perform various functions in an industrial setting these robots typically are used in factory assembly lines by the military and law enforcement agencies or in hazardous waste facilities handling substances far too dangerous for humans to handle safely no useful realworld robots resemble the humanoid creations of popular science fiction instead they usually consist of a manipulator arm an end effector hand and some kind of control device industrial robots generally are programmed to perform repetitive tasks in a highly controlled environment however more research is being done in the field of intelligent robots that can learn from their environment and move about it autonomously these robots use ai programming techniques to understand their environment and make appropriate decisions based on the information obtained in order to learn about one’s environment one must have a means of sensing the environment artificial intelligence programs allow the robot to gather information about its surroundings by using one of the following techniques contact sensing in which a robot sensor physically touches another object noncontact sensing such as computer vision in which the robot sensor does not physically touch the object but uses a camera to obtain and record information and environmental sensing in which the robot can sense external changes in the environment such as temperature or radiation much recent robotics research centers around mobile robots that can cope with environments that are hostile to humans such as damaged nuclearreactor cores active volcanic craters or the surfaces of other planets the twin mars exploration rovers that have been exploring opposite sides of mars since 2004 can navigate autonomously for short intervals thanks to ai software computerassisted instruction intelligent computerassisted instruction icai has three basic components problemsolving expertise student model and tutoring module the student using this type of program is presented with some information from the problemsolving expertise component this is the knowledge base of this type of ai program the student responds in some way to the material that was presented either by answering questions or otherwise demonstrating his or her understanding the student model analyzes the student’s responses and decides on a course of action typically this involves either presenting some review material or allowing the student to advance to the next level of knowledge presentation the tutoring module may or may not be employed at this point depending on the student’s level of mastery of the material the system does not allow the student to advance further than his or her own level of mastery most icai programs in use today operate in a set sequence presentation of new material evaluation of student response and employment of tutorial material if necessary however researchers at yale university have created software that uses a more socratic way of teaching these programs encourage discovery and often will not respond directly to a student’s questions about a specific topic the basic premise of this type of computerassisted learning is to present new material only when a student needs it this is when the brain is most ready to accept and retain the information this is exactly the scenario most teachers hope for students who become adroit selfeducators enthusiastically seeking the wisdom and truth that is meaningful to them the cost of these programs however can be far beyond the means of many school districts for this reason these types of icai are used mostly in corporate training settings see also automation computer analog

aleksander igor “beyond artificial intelligence” nature 429 2004 701702 johanna haaxmajurekwhat types of problem are appropriate for traditional algorithmic computing and what types call out for ai some of the tasks that are hardest for people are fortunately algorithmic in nature teachers can describe in detail the process for multiplying numbers and accountants can state accurately the rules for completing tax forms yet many people have difficulty performing these tasks straightforward algorithmic programs can perform them easily because they can be broken down into a series of precise procedures or steps that do not vary from case to case on the other hand tasks that require little thought for human beings can be hard to translate into algorithms and therefore difficult or so far impossible for computers to perform for example most people know that a pot of boiling water requires careful handling we identify hot pots by flexible recognition of many possible signs steam rising radiant heat felt on the skin a glimpse of blue flame or red coils under the pot a rattling lid and so forth once we know that the pot is boiling we plan our actions accordingly this process seems simple yet describing exactly to a computer how to reliably conclude “this pot is hot” and to take appropriate action turns out to be extremely difficult the goal of ai is to create computers that can handle such complex flexible situations with intelligence one obstacle to this goal is our uncertainty or confusion about what is “intelligence”one possible definition of intelligence is the acquisition and application of knowledge an intelligent entity in this view is one that learns—acquires knowledge—and is able to apply this knowledge to changing realworld situations in this sense a

solving is thus something ai does very well as long as the problem is narrow in focus and clearly defined for example mathematicians scientists and engineers are often called upon to prove theorems a theorem is a mathematical statement that is part of a larger theory or structure of ideas because the formulas involved in such tasks may be large and complex this can take an enormous amount of time thought and trial and error a specially designed ai program can reduce and simplify such formulas in a fraction of the time needed by human workers artificial intelligence can also assist with problems in planning an effective stepbystep sequence of actions that has the lowest cost and fewest steps is very important in business and manufacturing operations an ai program can be designed that includes all possible steps and outcomes the programmer must also set some criteria with which to judge the outcome such as whether speed is more important than cost in accomplishing the task or if lowest cost is the desired result regardless of how long it takes the plan generated by this type of ai program will take less time to generate than by traditional methods expert systems propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent416 the expert system is a major application of ai today also known as knowledgebased systems expert systems act as intelligent assistants to human experts or serve as a resource to people who may not have access to an expert the major difference between an expert system and a simple database containing information on a particular subject is that the database can only give the user discrete facts about the subject whereas an expert system uses reasoning to draw conclusions from stored information the purpose of this ai application is not to replace human experts but to make their knowledge and experience more widely available an expert system has three parts knowledge base inference engine and user interface the knowledge base contains both declarative factual and procedural rulesofusage knowledge in a very narrow field the inference engine runs the system by determining which procedural knowledge to access in order to obtain the appropriate declarative knowledge then draws conclusions and decides when an applicable solution is found an interface is usually defined as the point where the machine and the human “touch” an interface is usually a keyboard mouse or similar device in an expert system there are actually two different user interfaces one is for the designer of the system who is generally experienced with computers the other is for the user generally a computer novice because most users of an expert system will not be computer experts it is important that the system be easy for them to use all user interfaces are bidirectional that is are able to receive information from the user and respond to the user with recommendations the designer’s user interface must also be capable of adding new information to the knowledge base natural language processing propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent516 natural language is human language naturallanguageprocessing programs use artificial intelligence to allow a user to communicate with a computer in the user’s natural language the computer can both understand and respond to commands given in a natural language computer languages are artificial languages invented for the sake of communicating instructions to computers and enabling them to communicate with each other most computer languages consist of a combination of symbols numbers and some words these languages are complex and may take years to master by programming computers via computer languages to respond to our natural languages we make them easier to use however there are many problems in trying to make a computer understand people four problems arise that can cause misunderstanding 1 ambiguity— confusion over what is meant due to multiple meanings of words and phrases 2 imprecision—thoughts are sometimes expressed in vague and inexact terms 3 incompleteness—the entire idea is not presented and the listener is expected to “read between the lines” 4 inaccuracy—spelling punctuation and grammar problems can obscure meaning when we speak to one another furthermore we generally expect to be understood because our common language assumes all the meanings that we share as members of a specific cultural group to a nonnative speaker who shares less of our cultural background our meaning may not always be clear it is even more difficult for computers which have no share at all in the realworld relationships that confer meaning upon information to correctly interpret natural language propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent616 to alleviate these problems natural language processing programs seek to analyze syntax—the way words are put together in a sentence or phrase semantics—the derived meaning of the phrase or sentence and context—the meaning of distinct words within a sentence but even this is not enough the computer must also have access to a dictionary that contains definitions of every word and phrase it is likely to encounter and may also use keyword analysis—a patternmatching technique in which the program scans the text looking for words that it has been programmed to recognize if a keyword is found the program responds by manipulating the text to form a reasonable response in its simplest form a natural language processing program works like this a sentence is typed in on the keyboard if the program can derive meaning—that is if it has a reference in its knowledge base for every word and phrase—it will respond more or less appropriately an example of a computer with a natural language processor is the computerized card catalog available in many public libraries the main menu usually offers four choices for looking up information search by author search by title search by subject or search by keyword if you want a list of books on a specific topic or subject you type in the appropriate phrase you are asking the computer—in english—to tell you what is available on the topic the computer usually responds in a very short time—in english— with a list of books along with call numbers so you can find what you need computer vision computer vision is the use of a computer to analyze and evaluate visual information a camera is used to collect visual data the camera translates the image into a series of electrical signals this data is analog in nature—that is it is directly measurable and quantifiable a digital computer however operates using numbers expressed directly as digits it cannot read analog signals so the image must be digitized using an analogtodigital converter the image becomes a very long series of binary numbers that can be stored and interpreted by the computer just how long the series is depends on how densely packed the pixels are in the visual image to get an idea of pixels and digitized images take a close look at a newspaper photograph if you move the paper very close to your eyes you will notice that the image is a sequence of black and white dots—called pixels for picture elements—arranged in a certain pattern when you move the picture away from your eyes the picture becomes clearly defined and your brain is able to recognize the image artificial intelligence works much the same way clues provided by the arrangement of pixels in the image give information as to the relative color and texture of an object as well as the distance between objects in this way the computer can interpret and analyze visual images in the field of robotics visual analysis is very important robotics robotics is the study of robots which are machines that can be programmed to perform manual tasks most robots in use today perform various functions in an industrial setting these robots typically are used in factory assembly lines by the military and law enforcement agencies or in hazardous waste facilities handling substances far too dangerous for humans to handle safely no useful realworld robots resemble the humanoid creations of popular science fiction instead they usually consist of a manipulator arm an end effector hand and some kind of control device industrial robots generally are programmed to perform repetitive tasks in a highly controlled environment however more research is being done in the field of intelligent robots that can learn from their environment and move about it autonomously these robots use ai programming techniques to understand their environment and make appropriate decisions based on the information obtained in order to learn about one’s environment one must have a means of sensing the environment artificial intelligence programs allow the robot to gather information about its surroundings by using one of the following techniques contact sensing in which a robot sensor physically touches another object noncontact sensing such as computer vision in which the robot sensor does not physically touch the object but uses a camera to obtain and record information and environmental sensing in which the robot can sense external changes in the environment such as temperature or radiation much recent robotics research centers around mobile robots that can cope with environments that are hostile to humans such as damaged nuclearreactor cores active volcanic craters or the surfaces of other planets the twin mars exploration rovers that have been exploring opposite sides of mars since 2004 can navigate autonomously for short intervals thanks to ai software computerassisted instruction intelligent computerassisted instruction icai has three basic components problemsolving expertise student model and tutoring module the student using this type of program is presented with some information from the problemsolving expertise component this is the knowledge base of this type of ai program the student responds in some way to the material that was presented either by answering questions or otherwise demonstrating his or her understanding the student model analyzes the student’s responses and decides on a course of action typically this involves either presenting some review material or allowing the student to advance to the next level of

necessary however researchers at yale university have created software that uses a more socratic way of teaching these programs encourage discovery and often will not respond directly to a student’s questions about a specific topic the basic premise of this type of computerassisted learning is to present new material only when a student needs it this is when the brain is most ready to accept and retain the information this is exactly the scenario most teachers hope for students who become adroit selfeducators enthusiastically seeking the wisdom and truth that is meaningful to them the cost of

aleksander igor “beyond artificial intelligence” nature 429 2004 701702 johanna haaxmajurekall ai computer programs are built on two basic elements a knowledge base and an inferencing capability inferencing means drawing conclusions based on logic and prior knowledge a knowledge base is made up of many discrete units of information—representing facts concepts theories procedures and relationships—all relevant to a particular task or aspect of the world programs are written to give the computer the ability to manipulate this information and to reason make judgments reach conclusions and choose solutions to the problem at hand such as guessing whether a series of creditcard transactions involves fraud or driving an automated rover across a rocky martian landscape whereas conventional deterministic software must follow a strictly logical series of steps to reach a conclusion ai software uses the techniques of search and pattern matching it may also in some cases modify its knowledge base or its own structure “learn” pattern matching may still be algorithmic that is the computer must be told exactly where to look in its knowledge base and what constitutes a match the computer searches its knowledge base for specific conditions or patterns that fit the criteria of the problem to be solved microchips have increased computational speed allowing ai programs to quickly scan huge arrays of data for example computers can scan enough possible chess moves to provide a challenging opponent for even the best human players artificial

intelligence” nature 429 2004 701702 johanna haaxmajurekto alleviate these problems natural language processing programs seek to analyze syntax—the way words are put together in a sentence or phrase semantics—the derived meaning of the phrase or sentence and context—the meaning of distinct words within a sentence but even this is not enough the computer must also have access to a dictionary that contains definitions of every word and phrase it is likely to encounter and may also use keyword analysis—a patternmatching technique in which the program scans the text looking for words that it has been programmed to recognize if a keyword is found the program responds by manipulating the text to form a reasonable responsein its simplest form a natural language processing program works like this a sentence is typed in on the keyboard if the program can derive meaning—that is if it has a reference in its knowledge base for every word and phrase—it will respond more or less appropriately an example of a computer with a natural language processor is the computerized card catalog available in many public libraries the main menu usually offers four choices for looking up information search by author search by title search by subject or search by keyword if you want a list of books on a specific topic or subject you type in the appropriate phrase you are asking the computer—in english—to tell you what is available on the topic the computer usually responds in a very short time—in english— with a list of books along with call numbers so you can find what you needcomputer vision is the use of a computer to analyze and evaluate visual information a camera is used to collect visual data the camera translates the image into a series of electrical signals this data is analog in nature—that is it is directly measurable and quantifiable a digital computer however operates using numbers expressed directly as digits it cannot read analog signals so the image must be digitized using an analogtodigital converter the image becomes a very long series of binary numbers that can be stored and interpreted by the computer just how long the series is depends on how densely packed the pixels are in the visual image to get an idea of pixels and digitized images take a close look at a newspaper photograph if you move the paper very close to your eyes you will notice that the image is a sequence of black and white dots—called pixels for picture elements—arranged in a certain pattern when you move the picture away from your eyes the picture becomes clearly defined and your brain is able to recognize the imageartificial intelligence works much the same way clues provided by the arrangement of pixels in the image give information as to the relative color and texture of an object as well as the distance between objects in this way the computer can interpret and analyze visual images in the field of robotics visual analysis is very importantrobotics is the study of robots which are machines that can be programmed to perform manual tasks most robots in use today perform various functions in an industrial setting these robots typically are used in factory assembly lines by the military and law enforcement agencies or in hazardous waste facilities handling substances far too dangerous for humans to handle safelyno useful realworld robots resemble the humanoid creations of popular science fiction instead they usually consist of a manipulator arm an end effector hand and some kind of control device industrial robots generally are programmed to perform repetitive tasks in a highly controlled environment however more research is being done in the field of intelligent robots that can learn from their environment and move about it autonomously these robots use ai programming techniques to understand their environment and make appropriate decisions based on the information obtained in order to learn about one’s environment one must have a means of sensing the environment artificial intelligence programs allow the robot to gather information about its surroundings by using one of the following techniques contact sensing in which a robot sensor physically touches another object noncontact sensing such as computer vision in which the robot sensor does not physically touch the object but uses a camera to obtain and record information and environmental sensing in which the robot can sense external changes in the environment such as temperature or radiationmuch recent robotics research centers around mobile robots that can cope with environments that are hostile to humans such as damaged nuclearreactor cores active volcanic craters or the surfaces of other planets the twin mars exploration rovers that have been exploring opposite sides of mars since 2004 can navigate autonomously for short intervals thanks to ai softwareintelligent computerassisted instruction icai has three basic components problemsolving expertise student model and tutoring module the student using this type of program is presented with some information from the problemsolving expertise component this is the knowledge base of this type of ai program the student responds in some way to the material that was presented either by answering questions or otherwise demonstrating his or her understanding the student model analyzes the student’s responses and decides on a course of action typically this involves either presenting some review material or allowing the student to advance to the next level of knowledge presentation the tutoring module may or may not be employed at this point depending on the student’s level of mastery of the material the system does not allow the student to advance further than his or her own level of masterymost icai

and behavior and to develop methods for building computer systems that act as if they are thinking and can learn from themselves although the study of intelligence is the subject of other disciplines such as philosophy physiology psychology and neuroscience people in those disciplines have begun to work with computational scientists to build intelligent machines the computers offer a vehicle for testing theories of intelligence which in turn enable further exploration and understanding of the concept of intelligencethe growing information needs of the electronic age require sophisticated mechanisms for information processing as richard forsyth and roy rada 1986 point out ai can enhance information processing applications by enabling the computer systems to store and represent knowledge to apply that knowledge in problem solving through reasoning mechanisms and finally to acquire new knowledge through learningpropertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent117 the origin of ai can be traced to the end of world war ii when people started using computers to solve nonnumerical problems the first attempt to create intelligent machines was made by warren mcculloh and walter pitts in 1943 when they proposed a model of artificial networked neurons and claimed that properly defined networks could learn thus laying the foundation for neural networksin 1950 alan turing published computer machinery and intelligence where he explored the question of whether machines can think he also proposed the turing test as an operational measure of intelligence for computers the test requires that a human observer interrogates ie interacts with a computer and a human through a teletype both the computer and the human try to persuade the observer that she or he is interacting with a human at the other end of the line the computer is considered intelligent if the observer cannot tell the difference between the computer responses and the human responsesin 1956 john mccarthy coined the term artificial intelligence at a conference where the participants were researchers interested in machine intelligence the goal of the conference was to explore whether intelligence can be precisely defined and specified in order for a computer system to simulate it in 1958 mccarthy also invented lisp a highlevel ai programming language that continues to be used in ai programs other languages used for writing ai programs include prolog c and javaapproaches propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent217 stuart russell and peter norvig 1995 have identified the following four approaches to the goals of ai 1 computer systems that act like humans 2 programs that simulate the human mind 3 knowledge representation and mechanistic reasoning and 4 intelligent or rational agent design the first two approaches focus on studying humans and how they solve problems while the latter two approaches focus on studying realworld problems and developing rational solutions regardless of how a human would solve the same problemsprogramming a computer to act like a human is a difficult task and requires that the computer system be able to understand and process commands in natural language store knowledge retrieve and process that knowledge in order to derive conclusions and make decisions learn to adapt to new situations perceive objects through computer vision and have robotic capabilities to move and manipulate objects although this approach was inspired by the turing test most programs have been developed with the goal of enabling computers to interact with humans in a natural way rather than passing the turing testsome researchers focus instead on developing programs that simulate the way in which the human mind works on problemsolving tasks the first attempt to imitate human thinking was the logic theorist and the general problem solver programs developed by allen newell and herbert simon their main interest was in simulating human thinking rather than solving problems correctly cognitive science is the interdisciplinary field that studies the human mind and intelligence the basic premise of cognitive science is that the mind uses representations that are similar to computer data structures and computational procedures that are similar to computer algorithms that operate on those structures propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent317 other researchers focus on developing programs that use logical notation to represent a problem and use formal reasoning to solve a problem this is called the logicist approach to developing intelligent systems such programs require huge computational resources to create vast knowledge bases and to perform complex reasoning algorithms researchers continue to debate whether this strategy will lead to computer problem solving at the level of human intelligencestill other researchers focus on the development of intelligent agents within computer systems russell and norvig 1995 p 31 define these agents as anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through effectors the goal for computer scientists working in this area is to create agents that incorporate information about the users and the use of their systems into the agents operationsfundamental system issuesa robust ai system must be able to store knowledge apply that knowledge to the solution of problems and acquire new knowledge through experience among the challenges that face researchers in building ai systems there are three that are fundamental knowledge representation reasoning and searching and learningknowledge representationwhat ai researchers call knowledge appears as data at the level of programming data becomes knowledge when a computer program represents and uses the meaning of some data many knowledgebased programs are written in the lisp programming language which is designed to manipulate data as symbols propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent417 knowledge may be declarative or procedural declarative knowledge is represented as a static collection of facts with a set of procedures for manipulating the facts procedural knowledge is described by executable code that performs some action procedural knowledge refers to howto do something usually there is a need for both kinds of knowledge representation to capture and represent knowledge in a particular domainfirstorder predicate calculus fopc is the bestunderstood scheme for knowledge representation and reasoning in fopc knowledge about the world is represented as objects and relations between objects objects are realworld things that have individual identities and properties which are used to distinguish the things from other objects in a firstorder predicate language knowledge about the world is expressed in terms of sentences that are subject to the languages syntax and semanticsreasoning and searchingproblem solving can be viewed as searching one common way to deal with searching is to develop a productionrule system such systems use rules that tell the computer how to operate on data and control mechanisms that tell the computer how to follow the rules for example a very simple productionrule system has two rules if a then b and if b then c given the fact data a an algorithm can chain forward to b and then to c if c is the solution the algorithm haltsmatching techniques are frequently an important part of a problemsolving strategy in the above example the rules are activated only if a and b exist in the data the match between the a and b in the data and the a and b in the rule may not have to be exact and various deductive and inductive methods may be used to try to ascertain whether or not an adequate match exists propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent517 generateandtest is another approach to searching for a solution the users problem is represented as a set of states including a start state and a goal state the problem solver generates a state and then tests whether it is the goal state based on the results of the test another state is generated and then tested in practice heuristics or problemspecific rules of thumb must be found to expedite and reduce the cost of the search processlearningthe advent of highly parallel computers in the late 1980s enabled machine learning through neural networks and connectionist systems which simulate the structure operation of the brain parallel computers can operate together on the task with each computer doing only part of the task such systems use a network of interconnected processing elements called units each unit corresponds to a neuron in the human brain and can be in an on or off state in such a network the input to one unit is the output of another unit such networks of units can be programmed to represent shortterm and longterm working memory and also to represent and perform logical operations eg comparisons between numbers and between words a simple model of a learning system consists of four components the physical environment where the learning system operates the learning element the knowledge base and the performance element the environment supplies some information to the learning element the learning element uses this information to make improvements in an explicit knowledge base and the performance element uses the knowledge base to perform its task eg play chess prove a theorem the learning element is a mechanism that attempts to discover correct generalizations from raw data or to determine specific facts using general rules it processes information using induction and deduction in inductive information processing the system determines general rules and patterns from repeated exposure to raw data or experiences in deductive information processing the system determines specific facts from general rules eg theorem proving using axioms and other proven theorems the knowledge base is a set of facts about the world and these facts are expressed and stored in a computer system using a special knowledge representation languageapplicationsthere are two types of ai applications standalone ai programs and programs that are embedded in larger systems where they add capabilities for knowledge representation reasoning and learning some examples of ai applications include robotics computer vision naturallanguage processing and expert systemsrobotics propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent617 robotics is the intelligent connection of perception by the computer to its actions programs written for robots perform functions such as trajectory calculation interpretation of sensor data executions of adaptive control and access to databases of geometric models robotics is a challenging ai application because the software has to deal with real objects in real time an example of a robot guided by humans is the sojourner surface rover that explored the area of the red planet where the mars pathfinder landed in 1997 it was guided in real time by nasa controllers larry long and nancy long 2000 suggest that other robots can act autonomously reacting to changes in their environment without human intervention military cruise missiles are an example of autonomous robots that have intelligent navigational capabilitiescomputer visionthe goal of a computer vision system is to interpret visual data so that meaningful action can be based on that interpretation the problem as john mccarthy points out 2000 is that the real world has three dimensions while the input to cameras on which computer action is based represents only two dimensions the threedimensional characteristics of the image must be determined from various twodimensional manifestations to detect motion a chronological sequence of images is studied and the image is interpreted in terms of highlevel semantic and pragmatic units more work is needed in order to be able to represent threedimensional data easily perceived by the human eye to the computer advancements in computer vision technology will have a great effect on creating mobile robots while most robots are stationary some mobile robots with primitive vision capability can detect objects on their path but cannot recognize themnaturallanguage processinglanguage understanding is a complex problem because it requires programming to extract meaning from sequences of words and sentences at the lexical level the program uses words prefixes suffixes and other morphological forms and inflections at the syntactic level it uses a grammar to parse a sentence semantic interpretation ie deriving meaning from a group of words depends on domain knowledge to assess what an utterance means for example lets meet by the bank to get a few bucks means one thing to bank robbers and another to weekend hunters finally to interpret the pragmatic significance of a conversation the computer needs a detailed understanding of the goals of the participants in the conversation and the context of the conversationexpert systems propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent717 expert systems consist of a knowledge base and mechanismsprograms to infer meaning about how to act using that knowledge knowledge engineers and domain experts often create the knowledge base one of the first expert systems mycin was developed in the mid1970s mycin employed a few hundred ifthen rules about meningitis and bacteremia in order to deduce the proper treatment for a patient who showed signs of either of those diseases although mycin did better than students or practicing doctors it did not contain as much knowledge as physicians routinely need to diagnose the diseasealthough alan turings prediction that computers would be able to pass the turing test by the year 2000 was not realized much progress has been made and novel ai applications have been developed such as industrial robots medical diagnostic systems speech recognition in telephone systems and chess playing where ibms deep blue supercomputer defeated world champion gary kasparov conclusionthe success of any computer system depends on its being integrated into the workflow of those who are to use it and on its meeting of user needs a major future direction for ai concerns the integration of ai with other systems eg database management realtime control or user interface management in order to make those systems more usable

corresponds to a neuron in the human brain and can be in an on or off state in such a network the input to one unit is the output of another unit such networks of units can be programmed to represent shortterm and longterm working memory and also to represent and perform logical operations eg comparisons between numbers and between words a simple model of a learning system consists of four components the physical environment where the learning system operates the learning element the knowledge base and the performance element the environment supplies some information to the learning element the learning element uses this information to make improvements in an explicit knowledge base and the performance element uses the knowledge base to perform its task eg play chess prove a

and deduction in inductive information processing the system determines general rules and patterns from repeated exposure to raw data or experiences in deductive information processing the system

algorithms researchers continue to debate whether this strategy will lead to computer problem solving at the level of human intelligencestill other researchers focus on the development of intelligent agents within computer systems russell and norvig 1995 p 31 define these agents as anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through effectors the goal for computer scientists working in this area is to create agents that incorporate information about the users and the use of their systems into the agents operationsa robust ai

there are three that are fundamental knowledge representation reasoning and searching and learningwhat ai researchers call knowledge appears as data at the level of programming data becomes knowledge

human beings particularly numerical computation and the storage retrieval and sorting of large quantities of information however the ability of computers to interact flexibly with the real world—their intelligence—remains slight artificial intelligence ai is a subfield of computer science that seeks to remedy this situation by creating software and hardware that possess some of the behavioral flexibility shown by natural intelligences people and animalsin the 1940s and 1950s the first large electronic digital computers were designed to accomplish specific tasks eg a numerical calculation set up by a human programmer by completing a series of clearly defined steps an algorithm programmers wrote algorithmic software that precisely specified both the problem and how to solve it ai programmers in contrast seek to program computers not with rigid algorithms but with flexible rules for seeking solutions an ai program may even be designed to modify the rules it is given or to develop entirely new rulespropertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent118 what types of problem are appropriate for traditional algorithmic computing and what types call out for ai some of the tasks that are hardest for people are fortunately algorithmic in nature teachers can describe in detail the process for multiplying numbers and accountants can state accurately the rules for completing tax forms yet many people have difficulty performing such tasks straightforward algorithmic programs can perform them easily because they can be broken down into a series of precise procedures or steps that do not vary from case to case on the other hand tasks that require little thought for human beings can be hard to translate into algorithms and therefore difficult for computers to perform for example most people know that a pot of boiling water requires careful handling we identify hot pots by flexible recognition of many possible signs steam rising radiant heat felt on the skin a glimpse of blue flame or red coils under the pot a rattling lid and so forth once we know that the pot is boiling we plan our actions accordingly this process seems simple yet describing exactly to a computer how to reliably conclude this pot is hot and to take appropriate action turns out to be extremely difficult the goal of ai is to create computers that can handle such complex flexible situations one obstacle to this goal is uncertainty or confusion about what is intelligencewhat is intelligenceone possible definition of intelligence is the acquisition and application of knowledge an intelligent entity on this view is one that learns—acquires knowl edge—and is able to apply this knowledge to changing realworld situations in this sense a rat is intelligent but most computers despite their impressive numbercrunching capabilities are not to qualify as intelligent an ai system must use knowledge whether acquired from databases sensory devices trial and error or all of the above to make effective choices when confronted with data that are to some extent unpredictable insofar as a computer can do this it may be said for the purposes of ai to display intelligence note that this definition is purely functional and that in ai the question of consciousness though intriguing need not be consideredthis limited characterization of intelligence would perhaps have been considered overcautious by some ai researchers in the early days when optimism ran high for example us economist ai pioneer and nobel prize winner herbert simon 1916–2001 predicted in 1965 that by 1985 machines will be capable of doing any work man can do yet over 35 years later despite exponential growth in memory size and processing speed no computer even comes close to commonplace human skills like conversing driving a car or diapering a baby much less doing any work a human being can do why has progress in ai been so slow propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent218 one answer is that while intelligence as defined above requires knowledge computers are only good at handling information which is not the same thing knowledge is meaningful information and meaning is a nonmeasurable multivalued variable arising in the real world of things and values bits—binary digits 1s and 0s—have no meaning as such they are meaningful only when people assign meanings to them consider a single bit a 1 its information content is one bit regardless of what it means yet it may mean nothing or anything including the circuit is connected we surrender it is more likely to rain than snow and i like apples the question for ai is how can information be made meaningful to a computer simply adding more bits does not work for meaning arises not from information as such but from relationships involving the real world in one form or another this basic problem has been stymieing ai research for decades nor is it the only such problem another problem is that computers even those employing fuzzy logic and autonomous learning function by processing symbols eg 1s and 0s according to rules eg those of boolean algebra—yet human beings do not usually think by processing symbols according to rules humans are able think this way as when we do arithmetic but more commonly we interpret situations leap to conclusions utter sentences and plan actions using thought processes that do not involve symbolic computation at all what our thought processes really are—that is what our intelligence is preicsely—and how to translate it into or mimic it by means of a system of computable symbols and rules is a problem that remains unsolved in general by ai researchersin 1950 british mathematician alan turing 1912–1954 proposed a hypothetical game to help decide the issue of whether a given machine is truly intelligent the imitation game as turing originally called it consisted of a human questioner in a room typing questions on a keyboard in another room an unseen respondents—either a human or a computer—would type back answers the questioner could pose queries to the respondent in an attempt to determine if he or she was corresponding with a human or a computer in turings opinion if the computer could fool the questioner into believing that he or she was having a dialog with a human being then the computer could be said to be truly intelligentthe turing test is obviously biased toward human language prowess which most ai programs do not even seek to emulate nevertheless it is significant that even the most advanced ai programs devoted to natural language are as far as ever from passing the turing test intelligence has proved a far tougher nut to crack than the pioneers of ai believed half a century ago computers remain unintelligenteven so ai has made many gains since the 1950s ai software is now present in many devices such as automatic teller machines atms that are part of daily life and is finding increasing commercial application in many industriesoverview of ai propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent318 all ai computer programs are built on two basic elements a knowledge base and an inferencing capability inferencing means drawing conclusions based on logic and prior knowledge a knowledge base is made up of many discrete units of information—representing facts concepts theories procedures and relationships—all relevant to a particular task or aspect of the world programs are written to give the computer the ability to manipulate this information and to reason make judgments reach conclusions and choose solutions to the problem at hand such as guessing whether a series of creditcard transactions involves fraud or driving an automated rover across a rocky martian landscape whereas conventional deterministic software must follow a strictly logical series of steps to reach a conclusion ai software uses the techniques of search and pattern matching it may also in some cases modify its knowledge base or its own structure learn pattern matching may still be algorithmic that is the computer must be told exactly where to look in its knowledge base and what constitutes a match the computer searches its knowledge base for specific conditions or patterns that fit the criteria of the problem to be solved microchip technology has increased computational speed allowing ai programs to quickly scan huge arrays of data for example computers can scan enough possible chess moves to provide a challenging opponent for even the best human players artificial intelligence has many other applications including problem solving in mathematics and other fields expert systems in medicine natural language processing robotics and educationthe ability of some ai programs to solve problems based on facts rather than on a predetermined series of steps is what most closely resembles thinking and causes some in the ai field to argue that such devices are indeed intelligentgeneral problem solvingproblem solving is thus something ai does very well as long as the problem is narrow in focus and clearly defined for example mathematicians scientists and engineers are often called upon to prove theorems a theorem is a mathematical statement that is part of a larger theory or structure of ideas because the formulas involved in such tasks may be large and complex this can take an enormous amount of time thought and trial and error a specially designed ai program can reduce and simplify such formulas in a fraction of the time needed by human workersartificial intelligence can also assist with problems in planning an effective stepbystep sequence of actions that has the lowest cost and fewest steps is very important in business and manufacturing operations an ai program can be designed that includes all possible steps and outcomes the programmer must also set some criteria with which to judge the outcome such as whether speed is more important than cost in accomplishing the task or if lowest cost is the desired result regardless of how long it takes the plan generated by this type of ai program will take less time to generate than by traditional methodsexpert systems propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent418 the expert system is a major application of ai today also known as knowledgebased systems expert systems act as intelligent assistants to human experts or serve as a resource to people who may not have access to an expert the major difference between an expert system and a simple database containing information on a particular subject is that the database can only give the user discrete facts about the subject whereas an expert system uses reasoning to draw conclusions from stored information the purpose of this ai application is not to replace our human experts but to make their knowledge and experience more widely availablean expert system has three parts knowledge base inference engine and user interface the knowledge base contains both declarative factual and procedural rulesofusage knowledge in a very narrow field the inference engine runs the system by determining which procedural knowledge to access in order to obtain the appropriate declarative knowledge then draws conclusions and decides when an applicable solution is foundan interface is usually defined as the point where the machine and the human touch an interface is usually a keyboard mouse or similar devices in an expert system there are actually two different user interfaces one is for the designer of the system who is generally experienced with computers the other is for the user generally a computer novice because most users of an expert system will not be computer experts it is important that system be easy for them to use all user interfaces are bidirectional that is are able to receive information from the user and respond to the user with its recommendations the designers user interface must also be capable of adding new information to the knowledge basenatural language processingnatural language is human language naturallanguageprocessing programs use artificial intelligence to allow a user to communicate with a computer in the users natural language the computer can both understand and respond to commands given in a natural language propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent518 computer languages are artificial languages invented for the sake of communicating instructions to computers and enabling them to communicate with each other most computer languages consist of a combination of symbols numbers and some words these languages are complex and may take years to master by programming computers via computer languages to respond to our natural languages we make them easier to usehowever there are many problems in trying to make a computer understand people four problems arise that can cause misunderstanding 1 ambiguity—confusion over what is meant due to multiple meanings of words and phrases 2 imprecision—thoughts are sometimes expressed in vague and inexact terms 3 incompleteness—the entire idea is not presented and the listener is expected to read between the lines 4 inaccuracy—spelling punctuation and grammar problems can obscure meaning when we speak to one another furthermore we generally expect to be understood because our common language assumes all the meanings that we share as members of a specific cultural group to a nonnative speaker who shares fewer of our cultural background our meaning may not always be clear it is even more difficult for computers which have no share at all in the realworld relationships that confer meaning upon information to correctly interpret natural languageto alleviate these problems natural language processing programs seek to analyze syntax—the way words are put together in a sentence or phrase semantics—the derived meaning of the phrase or sentence and context—the meaning of distinct words within a sentence but even this is not enough the computer must also have access to a dictionary which contains definitions of every word and phrase it is likely to encounter and may also use keyword analysis—a patternmatching technique in which the program scans the text looking for words that it has been programmed to recognize if a keyword is found the program responds by manipulating the text to form a reasonable response propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent618 in its simplest form a natural language processing program works like this a sentence is typed in on the keyboard if the program can derive meaning—that is if it has a reference in its knowledge base for every word and phrase—it will respond more or less appropriately an example of a computer with a natural language processor is the computerized card catalog available in many public libraries the main menu usually offers four choices for looking up information search by author search by title search by subject or search by keyword if you want a list of books on a specific topic or subject you type in the appropriate phrase you are asking the computer—in english—to tell you what is available on the topic the computer usually responds in a very short time—in english—with a list of books along with call numbers so you can find what you needcomputer visioncomputer vision is the use of a computer to analyze and evaluate visual information a camera is used to collect visual data the camera translates the image into a series of electrical signals this data is analog in nature—that is it is directly measurable and quantifiable a digital computer however operates using numbers expressed directly as digits it cannot read analog signals so the image must be digitized using an analogtodigital converter the image becomes a very long series of binary numbers that can be stored and interpreted by the computer just how long the series is depends on how densely packed the pixels are in the visual image to get an idea of pixels and digitized images take a close look at a newspaper photograph if you move the paper very close to your eyes you will notice that the image is a sequence of black and white dots—called pixels for picture elements—arranged in a certain pattern when you move the picture away from your eyes the picture becomes clearly defined and your brain is able to recognize the imageartificial intelligence works much the same way clues provided by the arrangement of pixels in the image give information as to the relative color and texture of an object as well as the distance between objects in this way the computer can interpret and analyze visual images in the field of robotics visual analysis is very importantroboticsrobotics is the study of robots which are machines that can be programmed to perform manual tasks most robots in use today perform various functions in an industrial setting these robots typically are used in factory assembly lines by the military and law enforcement agencies or in hazardous waste facilities handling substances far too dangerous for humans to handle safelymost robots do not resemble the humanoid creations of popular science fiction instead they usually consist of a manipulator arm an end effector hand and some kind of control device industrial use robots generally are programmed to perform repetitive tasks in a highly controlled environment however more research is being done in the field of intelligent robots that can learn from their environment and move about it autonomously these robots use ai programming techniques to understand their environment and make appropriate decisions based on the information obtained in order to learn about ones environment one must have a means of sensing the environment artificial intelligence programs allow the robot to gather information about its surroundings by using one of the following techniques contact sensing in which a robot sensor physically touches another object noncontact sensing such as computer vision in which the robot sensor does not physically touch the object but uses a camera to obtain and record information and environmental sensing in which the robot can sense external changes in the environment such as temperature or radiation the most recent robotics research centers around mobile robots that can cope with environments that are hostile to humans such as damaged nuclearreactor cores active volcanic craters or the surfaces of other planetscomputerassisted instructionintelligent computerassisted instruction icai has three basic components problemsolving expertise student model and tutoring module the student using this type of program is presented with some information from the problemsolving expertise component this is the knowledge base of this type of ai program the student responds in some way to the material that was presented either by answering questions or otherwise demonstrating his or her understanding the student model analyzes the students responses and decides on a course of action typically this involves either presenting some review material or allowing the student to advance to the next level of knowledge presentation the tutoring module may or may not be employed at this point depending on the students level of mastery of the material the system does not allow the student to advance further than his or her own level of masterymost icai programs in use today operate in a set sequence of presentation of new material evaluation of student response and employment of tutorial if necessary however researchers at yale university have created software that uses a more socratic way of teaching these programs encourage discovery and often will not respond directly to a students questions about a specific topic the basic premise of this type of computerassisted learning is to present new material only when a student needs it this is when the brain is most ready to

with a human or a computer in turings opinion if the computer could fool the questioner into believing that he or she was having a dialog with a human being then the computer could be said to be truly intelligentthe turing test is obviously biased toward human language prowess which most ai programs do not even seek to emulate nevertheless it is significant that even the most advanced ai programs devoted to natural language are as far as ever from passing the turing test intelligence has proved a far tougher nut to crack than the pioneers of ai believed half a century ago computers remain unintelligenteven so ai has made many gains since the 1950s ai software is now present in many devices such as automatic teller machines atms that are part of daily life and is finding increasing commercial application in many industriespropertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent318 all ai computer programs are built on two basic elements a knowledge base and an inferencing capability inferencing means drawing conclusions based on logic and prior knowledge a knowledge base is made up of many discrete units of information—representing facts concepts theories procedures and relationships—all relevant to a particular task or aspect of the world programs are written to give the computer the ability to manipulate this information and to reason make judgments reach conclusions and choose solutions to the problem at hand such as guessing whether a series of creditcard transactions involves fraud or driving an automated rover across a rocky martian landscape whereas conventional deterministic software must follow a strictly logical series of steps to reach a conclusion ai software uses the techniques of search and pattern matching it may also in some cases modify its knowledge base or its own structure learn pattern matching may still be algorithmic that is the computer must be told exactly where to look in its knowledge base and what constitutes a match the computer searches its knowledge base for specific conditions or patterns that fit the criteria of the problem to be solved microchip technology has increased computational speed allowing ai programs to quickly scan huge arrays of data for example computers can scan enough possible chess moves to provide a challenging opponent for even the best human players artificial intelligence has many other applications including problem solving in mathematics and other fields expert systems in medicine natural language processing robotics and educationthe ability of some ai programs to solve problems based on facts rather than on a predetermined series of steps is what most closely resembles thinking and causes some in the ai field to argue that such devices are indeed intelligentgeneral problem solvingproblem solving is thus something ai does very well as long as the problem is narrow in focus and clearly defined for example mathematicians scientists and engineers are often called upon to prove theorems a theorem is a mathematical statement that is part of a larger theory or structure of ideas because the formulas involved in such tasks may be large and complex this can take an enormous amount of time thought and trial and error a specially designed ai program can reduce and simplify such formulas in a fraction of the time needed by human workersartificial intelligence can also assist with problems in planning an effective stepbystep sequence of actions that has the lowest cost and fewest steps is very important in business and manufacturing operations an ai program can be designed that includes all possible steps and outcomes the programmer must also set some criteria with which to judge the outcome such as whether speed is more important than cost in accomplishing the task or if lowest cost is the desired result regardless of how long it takes the plan generated by this type of ai program will take less time to generate than by traditional methodsexpert systems propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent418 the expert system is a major application of ai today also known as knowledgebased systems expert systems act as intelligent assistants to human experts or serve as a resource to people who may not have access to an expert the major difference between an expert system and a simple database containing information on a particular subject is that the database can only give the user discrete facts about the subject whereas an expert system uses reasoning to draw conclusions from stored information the purpose of this ai application is not to replace our human experts but to make their knowledge and experience more widely availablean expert system has three parts knowledge base inference engine and user interface the knowledge base contains both declarative factual and procedural rulesofusage knowledge in a very narrow field the inference engine runs the system by determining which procedural knowledge to access in order to obtain the appropriate declarative knowledge then draws conclusions and decides when an applicable solution is foundan interface is usually defined as the point where the machine and the human touch an interface is usually a keyboard mouse or similar devices in an expert system there are actually two different user interfaces one is for the designer of the system who is generally experienced with computers the other is for the user generally a computer novice because most users of an expert system will not be computer experts it is important that system be easy for them to use all user interfaces are bidirectional that is are able to receive information from the user and respond to the user with its recommendations the designers user interface must also be capable of adding new

usehowever there are many problems in trying to make a computer understand people four problems arise that can cause misunderstanding 1 ambiguity—confusion over what is meant due to multiple meanings of words and phrases 2 imprecision—thoughts are sometimes expressed in vague and inexact terms 3 incompleteness—the entire idea is not presented and the listener is expected to read between the lines 4 inaccuracy—spelling punctuation and grammar problems can obscure meaning when we speak to one another furthermore we generally expect to be understood because our common language assumes all the

computers which have no share at all in the realworld relationships that confer meaning upon information to correctly interpret natural languageto alleviate these problems natural language processing programs seek to analyze syntax—the way words are put together in a sentence or phrase semantics—the derived meaning of the phrase or sentence and context—the meaning of distinct words within a sentence but even this is not enough the computer must also have access to a dictionary which contains definitions of every word and phrase it is likely to encounter and may also use keyword

of a computer to analyze and evaluate visual information a camera is used to collect visual data the camera translates the image into a series of electrical signals this data is analog in nature—that

analogtodigital converter the image becomes a very long series of binary numbers that can be stored and interpreted by the computer just how long the series is depends on how densely packed the pixels are in the visual image to get an idea of pixels and digitized images take a close look at a newspaper photograph if you move the paper very close to your eyes you will notice that the image is a sequence of black and white dots—called pixels for picture elements—arranged in a certain pattern when you move the picture away from your eyes the picture becomes clearly defined and your brain is able to recognize the imageartificial intelligence works much the same way clues provided by the arrangement of pixels in the image give information as to the relative color and texture of an object

programming techniques to understand their environment and make appropriate decisions based on the information obtained in order to learn about ones environment one must have a means of sensing the environment artificial intelligence programs allow the robot to gather information about its surroundings by using one of the following techniques contact sensing in which a robot sensor physically touches another object noncontact sensing such as computer vision in which the robot sensor does not physically touch the object but uses a camera to obtain and record information and environmental sensing in which the robot can sense external changes in the environment such as temperature or radiation the most recent robotics research centers around mobile robots that can cope with environments

is if it has a reference in its knowledge base for every word and phrase—it will respond more or less appropriately an example of a computer with a natural language processor is the computerized card catalog available in many public libraries the main menu usually offers four choices for looking up information search by author search by title search by subject or search by keyword if you want a list of books on a specific topic or subject you type in the appropriate phrase you are asking the computer—in english—to tell you what is available on the topic the computer usually responds in a very short time—in english—with a list of books along with call numbers so you can find what you needcomputer vision is the use of a computer to analyze and evaluate visual information a camera is used to collect visual data the camera translates the image into a series of electrical signals this data is analog in nature—that is it is directly measurable and quantifiable a digital computer however operates using numbers expressed directly as digits it cannot read analog signals so the image must be digitized using an analogtodigital converter the image becomes a very long series of binary numbers that can be stored and interpreted by the computer just how long the series is depends on how densely packed the pixels are in the visual image to get an idea of pixels and digitized images take a close look at a newspaper photograph if you move the paper very close to your eyes you will notice that the image is a sequence of black and white dots—called pixels for picture elements—arranged in a certain pattern when you move the picture away from your eyes the picture becomes clearly defined and your brain is able to recognize the imageartificial intelligence works much the same way clues provided by the arrangement of pixels in the image give information as to the relative color and texture of an object as well as the distance between objects in this way the

systems researchers in ai use advanced techniques in computer science logic and mathematics to build computers and robots that can mimic or duplicate the intelligent behavior found in humans and other thinking things the desire to construct thinking artifacts is very old and is reflected in myths and legends as well as in the creation of lifelike art and clockwork automatons during the renaissance but it was not until the invention of programmable computers in the midtwentieth century that serious work in this field could beginthe computer scientist john mccarthy organized a conference at dartmouth college in 1956 where the field of ai was first defined as a research program since that time a large number of successful ai programs and robots have been built robots routinely explore the depths of the ocean and distant planets and the ai program built by international business machines ibm called deep blue was able to defeat the grand master chess champion garry kasparov after a series of highly publicized matches as impressive as these accomplishments are critics still maintain that ai has yet to achieve the goal of creating a program or robot that can truly operate on its own autonomously for any significant length of timepropertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent119 ai programs and autonomous robots are not yet advanced enough to survive on their own or interact with the world in the same way that a natural creature might so far ai programs have not been able to succeed in solving problems outside of narrowly defined domains for instance deep blue can play chess with the greatest players on the planet but it cannot do anything else the dream of ai is to create programs that not only play worldclass chess but also hold conversations with people interact with the outside world plan and coordinate goals and projects have independent personalities and perhaps exhibit some form of consciousnesscritics claim that ai will not achieve these latter goals one major criticism is that traditional ai focused too much on intelligence as a process that can be completely replicated in software and ignored the role played by the lived body that all natural intelligent beings possess dreyfus 1994 alternative fields such as embodied cognition and dynamic systems theory have been formed as a reply to this criticism winograd and flores 1987 yet researchers in traditional ai maintain that the only thing needed for traditional ai to succeed is simply more time and increased computing powerwhile ai researchers have not yet created machines with human intelligence there are many lesser ai applications in daily use in industry the military and even in home electronics in this entry the use of ai to replicate human intelligence in a machine will be called strong ai and any other use of ai will be referred to as weak aiethical issues of strong aiai has and will continue to pose a number of ethical issues that researchers in the field and society at large must confront the word computer predates computer technology and originally referred to a person employed to do routine mathematical calculations people no longer do these jobs because computing technology is so much better at routine calculations both in speed and accuracy moravec 1999 over time this trend continued and automation by robotic and ai technologies has caused more and more jobs to disappear one might argue however that many other important jobs have been created by ai technology and that those jobs lost were not fulfilling to the workers who had them propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent219 this is true enough but assuming strong ai is possible not only would manufacturing and assembly line jobs become fully automated but upper management and strategic planning positions may be computerized as well just as the greatest human chess masters cannot compete with ai so too might it become impossible for human ceos to compete with their ai counterparts if ai becomes sufficiently advanced it might then radically alter the kinds of jobs available with the potential to permanently remove a large segment of the population from the job market in a fully automated world people would have to make decisions about the elimination of entire categories of human work and find ways of supporting the people who were employed in those industriesother ethical implications of ai technology also exist from the beginning ai raised questions about what it means to be human in 1950 the mathematician and cryptographer alan turing 1912–1954 proposed a test to determine whether an intelligent machine had indeed been created if a person can have a normal conversation with a machine without the person being able to identify the interlocutor as a machine according to the turing test the machine is intelligent boden 1990 in the early twentyfirst century people regularly communicate with machines over the phone and turing tests are regularly held with successful results—as long as the topic of discussion is limited in the past special status as expert thinkers has been proposed as the quality that distinguishes humans from other creatures but with robust ai that would no longer be the case one positive effect might be that this technology could help to better explain the place of humans in nature and what it means for something to be considered a person foerst 1999the ethical responsibility that people have toward any strong ai application is a matter that must be taken into consideration it does not seem moral to create thinking minds and then force them to do work humans do not want to do themselvesfinally because ai technology deals directly with human operators people must make decisions regarding what kind of ethics and morality are going to be programmed into these thinking machines the scientist and fiction writer isaac asimov proposed in his writings three moral imperatives that should be programmed into robots and other ai creationsa robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harma robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders conflict with the first lawa robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent319 these imperatives make for good reading but are sadly lacking as a solution to the problems presented by fully autonomous robotic technologies asimov wrote many stories and novels the robot series 1940–1976 and irobot 1950 that used the unforeseen loopholes in the logic of these laws which occasionally allowed for fatal encounters between humans and robots for instance what should a robot do if in order to protect a large number of people it must harm one human who is threatening others it can also be argued that ai technologies have already begun to harm people in various ways and that these laws are hopelessly naïve idier 2000 other researchers in the field nevertheless argue that asimovs laws are actually relevant and at least suggest a direction to explore while designing a computational morality thompson 1999this problem is more pressing than it may seem because many industrial countries are working to create autonomous fighting vehicles to augment the capabilities of their armed forces such machines will have to be programmed so that they make appropriate life and death choices more subtle and nuanced solutions are needed and this topic remains wideopen—widely discussed in fiction but not adequately addressed by ai and robotics researchersethical issues of weak aieven if robust ai is not possible or the technology turns out to be a long way off there remain a number of vexing ethical problems to be confronted by researchers and technologists in the weak ai field instead of trying to create a machine that mimics or replicates exactly humanlike intelligence scientists may instead try to imbed smaller subtler levels of intelligence and automation into all daytoday technologies in 1991 mark weiser 1952–1999 coined the term ubiquitous computing to refer to this form of ai but it is also sometimes called the digital revolution gershenfeld 1999 propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent419 ubiquitous computing and the digital revolution involve adding computational power to everyday objects that when working together with other semismart objects help to automate human surroundings and hopefully make life easier gershenfeld 1999 for instance scientists could imbed very small computers into the packaging of food items that would network with a computer in the house and through the internet perhaps remind people that they need to restock the refrigerator even when they are away from home the system could be further automated so that it might even order the items so that one was never without them in this way the world would be literally at the service of human beings and the everyday items with which they interact would react intelligently to assist in their endeavors some form of this more modest style of ai is very likely to come into existence technologies are already moving in these directions through the merger of such things as mobile phones and personal data assistantsagain this trend is not without ethical implications in order for everyday technologies to operate in an intelligent manner they must take note of the behaviors wants and desires of their owners this means they will collect a large amount of data about each individual who interacts with them this data might include sensitive or embarrassing information about the user that could become known to anyone with the skill to access such information additionally these smart technologies will help increase the trend in direct marketing that is already taking over much of the bandwidth of the internet aggressive advertisement software spying software and computer viruses would almost certainly find their way to this new network these issues must be thoroughly considered and public policy enacted before such technology becomes widespreadin addition weiser 1999 argues that in the design of ubiquitous computing people should work with a sense of humility and reverence to make sure these devices enhance the humanness of the world advancing fundamental values and even spirituality rather then just focusing on efficiency simply put people should make their machines more human rather then letting the technology transform human beings into something more machinelike propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent519 a last ethical consideration is the possibility that ai may strengthen some forms of gender bias women in general and womens ways of knowing in particular have not played a large role in the development of ai technology and it has been argued that ai is the fruit of a number of social and philosophical movements that have not been friendly to the interests of women adam 1998 women are not equally represented as researchers in the field of ai and finding a way to reverse this trend is a pressing concern the claim that ai advances the interests of males over those of females is a more radical yet intriguing claim that deserves further studyai continues to grow in importance even though researchers have not yet been able to create a mechanical intelligence rivaling or exceeding that of human beings ai has provided an impressive array of technologies in the fields of robotics and automation computers are becoming more powerful in both the speed and number of operations they can achieve in any given amount of time if humans can solve the problem of how to program machines and other devices to display advanced levels of intelligence as well as address the many ethical issues raised by this technology then ai may yet

those who engineer devices that mediate the humantoworld interface should be especially careful that their work enhances human life rather than detracts from itwinograd terry and fernando flores 1987 understanding computers and cognition a new foundation for design boston addisonwesley publishing winograd and flores argue for a form of ai that takes into account the important counterarguments to traditional ai and instead of ignoring them incorporates them into a better science that takes the embodiment of cognitive agents seriouslythis is true enough but assuming strong ai is possible not only would manufacturing and assembly line jobs become fully automated but upper management and strategic planning positions may be computerized as well just as the greatest human chess masters cannot compete with ai so too might it become impossible for human ceos to compete with their ai counterparts if ai becomes sufficiently advanced it might then radically alter the kinds of jobs available with the potential to permanently remove a large segment of the population from the job market in a fully automated world people would have to make decisions about the elimination of entire categories of human work and find ways of supporting the people who were employed in those industriesother ethical implications of ai technology also exist from the beginning ai raised questions about what it means to be human in 1950 the mathematician and cryptographer alan turing 1912–1954 proposed a test to determine whether an intelligent machine had indeed been created if a person can have a normal conversation with a machine without the person being able to identify the interlocutor as a machine according to the turing test the machine is intelligent boden 1990 in the early twentyfirst century people regularly communicate with machines over the phone and turing tests are regularly held with successful results—as long as the topic of discussion is limited in the past special status as expert thinkers has been proposed as the quality that distinguishes humans from other creatures but with robust ai that would no longer be the case one positive effect might be that this technology could help to better explain the place of humans in nature and what it means for something to be considered a person foerst 1999the ethical responsibility that people have toward any strong ai application is a matter that must be taken into consideration it does not seem moral to create thinking minds and then force them to do work humans do not want to do themselvesfinally because ai technology deals directly with human operators people must make decisions regarding what kind of ethics and morality are going to be programmed into these thinking machines the scientist and fiction writer isaac asimov proposed in his writings three moral imperatives that should be programmed into robots and other ai creationspropertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent319 these imperatives make for good reading but are sadly lacking as a solution to the problems presented by fully autonomous robotic technologies asimov wrote many stories and novels the robot series 1940–1976 and irobot 1950 that used the unforeseen loopholes in the logic of these laws which occasionally allowed for fatal encounters between humans and robots for instance what should a robot do if in order to protect a large number of people it must harm one human who is threatening others it can also be argued that ai technologies have already begun to harm people in various ways and that these laws are hopelessly naïve idier 2000 other researchers in the field nevertheless argue that asimovs laws are actually relevant and at least suggest a direction to explore while designing a computational morality thompson 1999this problem is more pressing than it may seem because many industrial countries are working to create autonomous fighting vehicles to augment the capabilities of their armed forces such machines will have to be programmed so that they make appropriate life and death choices more subtle and nuanced solutions are needed and this topic remains wideopen—widely discussed in fiction but not adequately addressed by ai and robotics researchersethical issues of weak aieven if robust ai is not possible or the technology turns out to be a long way off there remain a number of vexing ethical problems to be confronted by researchers and technologists in the weak ai field instead of trying to create a machine that mimics or replicates exactly humanlike intelligence scientists may instead try to imbed smaller subtler levels of intelligence and automation into all daytoday technologies in 1991 mark weiser 1952–1999 coined the term ubiquitous computing to refer to this form of ai but it is also sometimes called the digital revolution gershenfeld 1999 propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent419 ubiquitous computing and the digital revolution involve adding computational power to everyday objects that when working together with other semismart objects help to automate human surroundings and hopefully make life easier gershenfeld 1999 for instance scientists could imbed very small computers into the packaging of food items that would network with a computer in the house and through the internet perhaps remind people that they need to restock the refrigerator even when they are away from home the system could be further automated so that it might even order the items so that one was never without them in this way the world would be literally at the service of human beings and the everyday items with which they interact would react intelligently to assist in their endeavors some form of this more modest style of ai is very likely to come into existence technologies are already moving in these directions through the merger of such things as mobile phones and personal data assistantsagain this trend is not without ethical implications in order for everyday technologies to operate in an intelligent manner they must take note of the behaviors wants and desires of their owners this means they will collect a large amount of data about each individual who interacts with them this data might include sensitive or embarrassing information about the user that could become known to anyone with the skill to access such information additionally these smart technologies will help increase the trend in direct marketing that is already taking over much of the bandwidth of the internet aggressive advertisement software spying software and computer viruses would almost certainly find their way to this new network these issues must be thoroughly considered and public policy enacted before such technology becomes widespreadin addition weiser 1999 argues that in the design of ubiquitous computing people should work with a sense of humility and reverence to make sure these devices enhance the humanness of the world advancing fundamental values and even spirituality rather then just focusing on efficiency simply put people should make their machines more human rather then letting the technology transform human beings into something more machinelike propertagcmdpushfunction properdisplayencyclopediacontent519 a last ethical consideration is the possibility that ai may strengthen some forms of gender bias women in general and womens ways of knowing in particular have not played a large role in the development of ai technology and it has been argued that ai is the fruit of a number of social and philosophical movements that have not been friendly to the interests of women adam 1998 women are not equally represented as researchers in the field of ai and finding a way to reverse this trend is a

markets through digital innovationservices enquiries 0161 260 0310there are plenty of wild statements being thrown around about artificial intelligence – from a threat to our jobs to a threat to the human race as we know it so is this all hyperbole or are the fears actually based on some facts we investigatethe concept of artificial intelligence is that computer systems can be used to perform tasks that would normally require a human these can range from speech recognition and translation into different languages all the way through to visual perception and even decision makingbroadly speaking anything can be considered artificial intelligence if it involves a program doing something that we would normally think would rely on the intelligence of a human quite how this is achieved is not the point – just the fact that it can be done is a sign of artificial intelligencewithin the realm of artificial intelligence there are different classifications they includestrong artificial intelligence refers to the work that looks to genuinely imitate a human – and that could potentially even explain the way humans think few examples of this exist currently then there is weak artificial intelligence which simply aims to build systems that are able to behave in the same manner as humans but do not have the aim of thinking as humans thinkanother classification of artificial intelligence are those that are meant to meet certain tasks known as narrow artificial intelligence and those designed to reason known as general artificial intelligence so what are the pros and cons of artificial intelligencethere are several advantages and disadvantages associated with the conceptone massive advantage of artificial intelligence is its potential to complete mundane tasks through intricate automation that will increase productivity theoretically this can even remove “boring” tasks from humans and free them up to be increasingly creativeusing artificial intelligence alongside cognitive technologies can help make faster decisions and carry out actions quickerthe phrase “human error” was born because humans naturally make mistakes from time to time computers however do not make these mistakes – that is of course assuming they are programmed properly with artificial intelligence data could be processed errorfree no matter how big the dataset might bewith artificial intelligence you can arguably lessen the risks you expose humans to in the name of research take for example space exploration and the mars rover known as curiosity it can travel across the landscape of mars exploring it and determining the best paths to take while learning to think for itself using artificial intelligence in this manner could potentially lead to massive benefits in areas such as demand forecasting medical diagnosis and oil explorationthere is little doubt that artificial intelligence will displace many lowskilled jobs arguably robots have already taken many jobs on the assembly line – but now this could extend to new levels take for example the concept of driverless cars which could displace the need to have millions of human drivers from taxi drivers to chauffeurs very quickly of course some would argue that artificial intelligence will create more wealth than it destroys – but there is genuine risk that this will not be distributed evenly particularly during its early expansionartificial intelligence carries the risk in the minds of some of taking control away from humans – dehumanising actions in many ways nations that are in possession of artificial intelligence could theoretically kill humans without needing to pull a triggerhumans can take unique circumstances and judgement calls into account when they make their decisions something that artificial intelligence may never be able to do one example occurred in sydney australia in 2014 when a shooting drama in the downtown area prompted people to make numerous calls to uber in an effort to escape the area the result was that uber’s ride rates surged based on its supply and demand algorithm – there was no consideration involved for the circumstances in which the riders found themselvesif you think that artificial intelligence is just a futuristic jetsonsstyle image that is unlikely to ever affect humans on a mass scale then look no further than the employees of fukoko mutual life insurance in japan in january 2017 34 of its employees were dismissed from their jobs because the insurer had installed a new artificial intelligence system that could read medical certificates gather data on hospital stays and surgeries and in the process save the company an estimated 140 million yen per year in salary costsindeed a world economic forum study in 2016 predicted that around 51 million jobs will be lost to artificial intelligence over the next five years alone across 15 countries yet to counterbalance this argument looking at the same industry – insurance – there are advantages to be gained too in february 2017 tractable launched a system it claims could “radically transform” motor claims by simplifying the tedious manual process and helping to fight insurance fraud by flagging suspicious claims – potentially removing stress and expense from the process leading to cost savings for companies and policyholders alikeclearly artificial intelligence has massive potential advantages the key for humans however will be to use their own judgement to apply it productively and ensure the “rise of the robots” doesn’t get out of handcurated contentai

intelligence ai is the ability of a computer program or a machine to think and learn it is also a field of study which tries to make computers smart they work on their own without being encoded with commands john mccarthy came up with the name artificial intelligence in 1955in general use the term artificial intelligence means a machine which mimics human cognition at least some of the things we associate with other minds such as learning and problem solving can be done by computers though not in the same way as we do1 andreas kaplan and michael haenlein define ai as a system’s ability to correctly interpret external data to learn from such data and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation2an ideal perfect intelligent machine is a flexible agent which perceives its environment and takes actions to maximize its chance of success at some goal or objective3 as machines become increasingly capable mental facilities once thought to require intelligence are removed from the definition for example optical character recognition is no longer perceived as an exemplar of artificial intelligence it is just a routine technologyat present we use the term ai for successfully understanding human speech1 competing at a high level in strategic game systems such as chess and go selfdriving cars and interpreting complex data4 some people also consider ai a danger to humanity if it continues to progress at its current pace5an extreme goal of ai research is to create computer programs that can learn solve problems and think logically67 in practice however most applications have picked on problems which computers can do well searching data bases and doing calculations are things computers do better than people on the other hand perceiving its environment in any real sense is way beyond presentday computingai involves many different fields like computer science mathematics linguistics psychology neuroscience and philosophy eventually researchers hope to create a general artificial intelligence which can solve many problems instead of focusing on just one researchers are also trying to create creative and emotional ai which can possibly empathize or create art many approaches and tools have been triedborrowing from the management literature kaplan and haenlein classify artificial intelligence into three different types of ai systems analytical humaninspired and humanized artificial intelligence8 analytical ai has only characteristics consistent with cognitive intelligence generating cognitive representation of the world and using learning based on past experience to inform future decisions humaninspired ai has elements from cognitive as well as emotional intelligence understanding in addition to cognitive elements also human emotions considering them in their decision making humanized ai shows characteristics of all types of competencies ie cognitive emotional and social intelligence able to be selfconscious and selfaware in interactions with othersthe first appearance of artificial intelligence is in greek myths like talos of crete or the bronze robot of hephaestus humanoid robots were built by yan shi hero of alexandria and aljazari sentient machines became popular in fiction during the 19th and 20th centuries with the stories of frankenstein and rossums universal robotsformal logic was developed by ancient greek philosophers and mathematicians this study of logic produced the idea of a computer in the 19th and 20th century mathematician alan turings theory of computation said that any mathematical problem could be solved by processing 1s and 0s advances in neurology information theory and cybernetics convinced a small group of researchers that an electronic brain was possibleai research really started with a conference at dartmouth college in 1956 it was a month long brainstorming session attended by many people with interests in ai at the conference they wrote programs that were amazing at the time beating people at checkers or solving word problems the department of defense started giving a lot of money to ai research and labs were created all over the worldunfortunately researchers really underestimated just how hard some problems were the tools they had used still did not give computers things like emotions or common sense mathematician james lighthill wrote a report on ai saying that in no part of the field have discoveries made so far produced the major impact that was then promised9 the us and british governments wanted to fund more productive projects funding for ai research was cut starting an ai winter where little research was doneai research revived in the 1980s because of the popularity of expert systems which simulated the knowledge of a human expert by 1985 1 billion dollars were spent on ai new faster computers convinced us and british governments to start funding ai research again however the market for lisp machines collapsed in 1987 and funding was pulled again starting an even longer ai winterai revived again in the 90s and early 2000s with its use in data mining and medical diagnosis this was possible because of faster computers and focusing on solving more specific problems in 1997 deep blue became the first computer program to beat chess world champion garry kasparov faster computers advances in deep learning and access to more data have made ai popular throughout the world in 2011 ibm watson beat the top two jeopardy players brad rutter and ken jennings and in 2016 googles alphago beat top go

dichotomies a lot of science fiction is concerned about if a robot alien or whatever is a person however — sometimes in the same story — finding life is as easy as asking the science officer with a fancy tricorder if you go to mars and meet marvin it is pretty clear he’s alive but faced with a bunch of organic molecules the task is a bit harder now it is going to get harder still because cornell scientists have created a material that has an artificial metabolism and checks quite a few boxes of what we associate with life you can read the entire paper if you want more detailthree of the things people look for to classify something as alive is that it has a metabolism selfarranges and reproduces there are other characteristics depending on who you ask but those three are pretty crucialthe material is a biomaterial that emerges from its building blocks and arranges itself – first into polymers and eventually tiny shapes starting from a 55nucleotide base seed sequence the dna molecules were multiplied to create tiny chains of repeating dnathe material was placed in a flow of chemicals — the equivalent of food for the synthetic beast — the dna synthesized its own new strands with the front end of the material growing and the tail end degrading simultaneously the effect is that the “creature” moves against the flow like a slime mold doesif you’ve just invented fake life and it will move what do you do race them against each other of course that’s exactly what they did — you can’t make this stuff upalthough the material uses instructions coded with dna it is still pretty crude only lasting a few generations for now the material also doesn’t respond to stimulus — another key indicator of life of course because it is dnabased it is possible that they’ll succeed in making it do so or that it could mutate on its own you can only wonder if life started with simple building blocks like this untold number of years agowe’ve seen dna computation lately we’ve even seen tiny voltmeters too maybe dna will be the next generation’s silicon“the effect is that the “creature” moves against the flow like a slime mold does”er or like a glacier although glaciers are limited in their movement “toward the flow” by gravity but they definitely break down at the other end if this dna material were on an inclined lowfriction substrate and the flow was downward it’d probably behave like a glacier growing upward against the flow until its weight overcame friction and it slid down the inclinei’d make the argument that the protoorganism is responding to stimulus albeit in a very simple way growing in the direction of flow is a reaction to the environment it could even be argued that it is a positive trait as the wee beastie is moving towards a “food source”it would be interesting to see if additional modes could be developed or even some level of evolution or mutation achieved through modification of the dna setidentifying life by base characterization has fascinated me since i read the andromeda strain as a kidthe question here is did the researchers orient it towards the flow to make it move against it or is it self orientingif you go to mars and meet marvin you won’t enjoy it httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvz0ybf1jktw8featureyoutubet94hilarious and that crew looked like some kind of recreation of a “missing persons” 80’s music videowill artificial life have artificial stupidityartificial virusarguably just a different form of “artificial life”this seems more like bioengineering than creating artificial life i mean they built up a piece of dna the basic building block of all natural life using natural organic molecules what they did is cool and interesting but not what i would call artificialsynthetici had the same thoughts it’s not creating life it’s taking parts of a live organism and creating a new artificial organism from itfor the experiments they used repliphi™ phi29 dna polymerase which is extracted from b subtilis phage phi29 – the smallest bacteriophage that’s been found so far with doublestrand dna it is interesting that it follows certain growth patterns but this seems pretty normal to me – generating new components where the nutrients are richestthe article is pretty interesting to me though i’m not really a bio guy and just spent some time researching the experiments and componentsi guess you do have to draw a line somewhere though to call something a new creation at the ‘building dna from the available blocks’ point the ‘start with nucleotide molecules’ or the individual elements…it reminds me of an old joke about the scientist who meets god and says ‘hey i can create life too’… god says ‘show me’ the scientist says ‘ok starting with carbon nitro…’ – god cuts him off with ‘oh no those are my atoms go make your own’maybe they should try rewriting the dna with synthetic base pairs to see if it will still functionhttpsenwikipediaorgwikihachimojidnathings like this have always amazed me and interested me in the potential ways life could come about like imagine a considerably more energetic planet but still with flowing liquid of some kind we already know from that one extremophile that life can use higher elements in the same group like arsenic instead of phosphorous now imagine that with dna in general life tends to evolve to the most optimal energy levels – whatever takes least effort and maximum survivability a higher energy planet could allow for vastly more complex “dna” like system to come about we’ve even made some artificial dna with a metal backbone which could be possible with some crazy exotic chemistry on said higher energy planet you could maybe even find creatures actually legit capable of breathing fire we’re at the ignitiontemperatures for various materials but equally life would generally also evolve being fireproof so it’d level out over time like the toxins race did with species on our world and is still happening now such a world would look like hell to us but it’d be an average day for themon the intelligence side some intelligent species could be vastly more capable due to the extra energy around humans are horribly limited due to our redundant biology and legacy systems that don’t really apply much in the civilized world today if you were to strip out a lot of the junk in our brains they’d be quite a bit smaller but you could use that extra space by making all sensory input absolutely discrete as currently even the brain timeslices to an extent it was found out fairly recently that focusing too much on certain senses hinders others quite dramatically it’s the reason illusionists and magicians are capable of pulling off some tricks by making you focus intensely on some things with misdirection they finally figured out why that worked focusing too much on say something visual can almost make you deaf but more in the sense that your brain doesn’t really process it to the extent it normally does no pattern recognition it doesn’t pick out any useful information and make you go “oh hey this interests me lets listen in” it just “goes in one ear and out the other” as they say lol the massive influx of highenergy foods over the past thousand odd years is causing some evolutionary changes in us though quite big ones what we will look like in a thousand more is anyones guess but i can tell you one thing our ability to survive in the wild will fall off quite sharply as it does since our bodies will be more demanding maybe our senses will specialize more and increase in fidelity bigger noses again to cool our increasingly powerhungry brains there will come a point in the future with graphene or similar processor substrate where the corecounts of cpus will allow for far more computation than the human brain can and still be smaller but definitely use way more power if an animal evolved a brain that capable in the wild it’d die very quickly lol even humans struggle in the wild as it is at best we could manage 15 billion preindustrialization because we dropped like flies at a simple scratch or thencommon failed births in the case of us we’ll probably end up augmenting our bodies with tech by a century never mind thousand years once a species gets so advanced natural biology stops being a driving force and more “i wonder what videogame character i can have fun times with today let’s 3d print it” worry but on a planet with so much extra energy around it’s not so much of a problem whether a species would evolve a higher intelligence to make up for that or not is also another question so many possible avenues it could go until we actually get some proper artificial life growing on its own for millions of generations then we’ll know i think it is best to do it virtually than physically though x generations in reproduce the survivor for real and see if it confirms the virtual model we’ve been able to create some amazing novel materials using material simulators in recent years pretty damn successfully chemistry simulators are finally at a stage where they are actually really useful biology will be the next big boom in simulation can’t waitcareful the video just crashed my system virus ransomware too soon to telldon’t we have artificial life moving abundantly amongst us in australia we a facilty that breeds an abundance called parliament house it is fed by the ill informed scribbling of the national media outletsfrom what i’ve seen every other nation has a similar incubatorwhile one definition of life includes excretion i don’t thing a chamber full of assholes would qualify as life as we know itand those two “9 year old” organisms that escaped a lab and terrified a mallyet another case of the absolute obsession with dna and rna life requires harnessing an energy gradient to drive its actions a bunch of replicating nucleic acids is nifty but doesn’t necessarily actually do anything would be more impressed with a syntheticartificial metabolism – some set of enzymes that could reproduce themselves from a soup of simpler molecules including something that could exploit latent potential energy within that soup because that would have properties somewhere between simple fire and actual life accidental inclusion of extraneous molecules could occasionally expand the system constituting inheritance and mutation

comment reply titime says april 19 2019 at 453 am the question here is did the researchers orient it towards the flow to make it move against it or is it self orienting report comment reply dumber smaller groot codereclaimers says april 19 2019 at 503 am if you go to mars and meet marvin you won’t enjoy it httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvz0ybf1jktw8featureyoutubet94 report comment reply cmh62 says april 20 2019 at 905 am hilarious and that crew looked like some kind of recreation of a “missing persons” 80’s music video report comment reply ren says april 19 2019 at 617 am will artificial life have artificial stupidity report comment reply ostracus says april 19 2019 at 622 am artificial virus report comment reply steven says april 19 2019 at 1249 pm arguably just a different form of “artificial life” report comment reply tm32 says april 19 2019 at 907 am this seems more like bioengineering than creating artificial life i mean they built up a piece of dna the basic building block of all natural life using natural organic molecules what they did is cool and interesting but not what i would call artificial report comment reply ren says april 19 2019 at 909 am synthetic report comment reply tim s says april 19 2019 at 1208 pm i had the same thoughts it’s not creating life it’s taking parts of a live organism and creating a new artificial organism from it for the experiments they used repliphi™ phi29 dna polymerase which is extracted from b subtilis phage phi29 – the smallest bacteriophage that’s been found so far with doublestrand dna it is interesting that it follows certain growth patterns but this seems pretty normal to me – generating new components where the nutrients are richest the article is pretty interesting to me though i’m not really a bio guy and just spent some time researching the experiments and components i guess you do have to draw a line somewhere though to call something a new creation at the ‘building dna from the available blocks’ point the ‘start with nucleotide molecules’ or the individual elements… it reminds me of an old joke about the scientist who meets god and says ‘hey i can create life too’… god says ‘show me’ the scientist says ‘ok starting with carbon nitro…’ – god cuts him off with ‘oh no those are my atoms go make your own’ report comment reply hirudinea says april 19 2019 at 1254 pm maybe they should try rewriting the dna with synthetic base pairs to see if it will still function httpsenwikipediaorgwikihachimojidna report comment reply kris says april 19 2019 at 528 pm things like this have always amazed me and interested me in the potential ways life could come about like imagine a considerably more energetic planet but still with flowing liquid of some kind we already know from that one extremophile that life can use higher elements in the same group like arsenic instead of phosphorous now imagine that with dna in general life tends to evolve to the most optimal energy levels – whatever takes least effort and maximum survivability a higher energy planet could allow for vastly more complex “dna” like system to come about we’ve even made some artificial dna with a metal backbone which could be possible with some crazy exotic chemistry on said higher energy planet you could maybe even find creatures actually legit capable of breathing fire we’re at the ignitiontemperatures for various materials but equally life would generally also evolve being fireproof so it’d level out over time like the toxins race did with species on our world and is still happening now such a world would look like hell to us but it’d be an average day for them on the intelligence side some intelligent species could be vastly more capable due to the extra energy around humans are horribly limited due to our redundant biology and legacy systems that don’t really apply much in the civilized world today if you were to strip out a lot of the junk in our brains they’d be quite a bit smaller but you could use that extra space by making all sensory input absolutely discrete as currently even the brain timeslices to an extent it was found out fairly recently that focusing too much on certain senses hinders others quite dramatically it’s the reason illusionists and magicians are capable of pulling off some tricks by making you focus intensely on some things with misdirection they finally figured out why that worked focusing too much on say something visual can almost make you deaf but more in the sense that your brain doesn’t really process it to the extent it normally does no pattern recognition it doesn’t pick out any useful information and make you go “oh hey this interests me lets listen in” it just “goes in one ear and out the other” as they say lol the massive influx of highenergy foods over the past thousand odd years is causing some evolutionary changes in us though quite big ones what we will look like in a thousand more is anyones guess but i can tell you one thing our ability to survive in the wild will fall off quite sharply as it does since our bodies will be more demanding maybe our senses will specialize more and increase in fidelity bigger noses again to cool our increasingly powerhungry brains there will come a point in the future with graphene or similar processor substrate where the corecounts of cpus will allow for far more computation than the human brain can and still be smaller but definitely use way more power if an animal evolved a brain that capable in the wild it’d die very quickly lol even humans struggle in the wild as it is at best we could manage 15 billion preindustrialization because we dropped like flies at a simple scratch or thencommon failed births in the case of us we’ll probably end up augmenting our bodies with tech by a century never mind thousand years once a species gets so advanced natural biology stops being a driving force and more “i wonder what videogame character i can have fun times with today let’s 3d print it” worry but on a planet with so much extra energy around it’s not so much of a problem whether a species would evolve a higher intelligence to make up for that or not is also another question so many possible avenues it could go until we actually get some proper artificial life growing on its own for millions of generations then we’ll know i think it is best to do it virtually than physically though x generations in reproduce the survivor for real and see if it confirms the virtual model we’ve been able to create some amazing novel materials using material simulators in recent years pretty damn successfully chemistry simulators are finally at a stage where they are actually really useful biology will be the next big boom in simulation can’t wait report comment reply jackcrenshaw says april 19 2019 at 1120 am careful the video just crashed my system virus ransomware too soon to tell report comment reply saabman says april 19 2019 at 232 pm don’t we have artificial life moving abundantly amongst us in australia we a facilty that breeds an abundance called parliament house it is fed by the ill informed scribbling of the national media outlets from what i’ve seen every other nation has a similar incubator report comment reply hirudinea says april 19 2019 at 620 pm while one definition of life includes excretion i don’t thing a chamber full of assholes would qualify as life as we know it report comment reply jon h says april 20 2019 at 1252 pm and those two “9 year old” organisms that escaped a lab and terrified a mall report comment reply greenbit says april 19 2019 at 725 pm yet another case of the absolute obsession with dna and rna life requires harnessing an energy gradient to drive its actions a bunch of replicating nucleic acids is nifty but doesn’t necessarily actually do anything would be more impressed with a syntheticartificial metabolism – some set of enzymes that could reproduce themselves from a soup of simpler molecules including something that could exploit latent potential energy within that soup because that would have properties somewhere between simple fire and actual life accidental inclusion of extraneous molecules could occasionally expand the system constituting inheritance and mutation get that far and evolution is underway predna and then if it happened to acquire an informationdense component like rna and that conferred an advantage the rest would follow show me the enzymes report comment replytitime says april 19 2019 at 453 am the question here is did the researchers orient it towards the flow to
